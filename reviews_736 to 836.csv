Movie,Review
Mortal Kombat (1995),"A lot of the video game to move adaptations have been a much maligned concept and a majority of them have turned out to be box office disasters. One of many of these examples include Super Mario Bros (1993) and Street Fighter (1994) which instantly spring to mind. Mortal Kombat has the distinction of being the few of the better video game to movie adaptations.

Based on the controversial best selling ultra violent video game, the movie centres on Shaolin monk Liu Kang (Robin Shou) out to avenge the death of his brother at the hands of Shang Tsung (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa), actor Johnny Cage (Linden Ashby) out to prove that he is not just a pretty face, and special forces officer Sonya Blade (Bridgette Wilson) who is in hot pursuit of criminal Kano (the late Trevor Goddard). Liu Kang, Johnny Cage and Sonya Blade are handpicked by the god of thunder Raiden (Christopher Lambert) as contenders for the Mortal Kombat tournament to claim triumph over the Outworld to prevent the Emperor Shao Kahn from invading Earth.

Assisted by Princess Kitana and Raiden, the trio must also battle a variety of opponents including Scorpion, Sub Zero, Reptile, Goro and lastly Shang Tsung.

Director Paul W.S. Anderson (Resident Evil, Alien Vs Predator) keeps the plot straightforward and ensures the movie remains faithful to the video game. The acting won't net any awards but all did a fine job. The movie could have been added to the list of box office disasters but audiences, in particular fans of the video game, got a kick out of the movie and consider it to be a flawless victory.

Mortal Kombat is certainly a worthy video game to movie adaptation. It is still a fun movie.

7/10."
Pocahontas (1995),"Disney hit a rut in the late-90s with a string of critical and audience failures that began with Pocahontas and lasted through Hunchback, Hercules, Dinosaur etc. It was also one of two historically- inaccurate movies starring ""Mad"" Mel Gibson that came out in Fall 1995 in the UK. Both of which I never got to see until much later.

From a technical standpoint there is nothing wrong with Pocahontas, as a matter of fact it's far more colorful, atmospheric, and grown-up than The Lion King, which came out a year before. But in the process it lost much of its younger audience and now only seems to appeal to adults. The story lets everything else down. It's so bland and generic when it could have had the moxie to go much further and be just a tad more complex. It certainly had the visual energy to back it up even it were to try and fail. Alan Menken's score is also horrible and totally inappropriate to the scenes he is supposedly enhancing. Songs come and go, some last only a few moments. If feels like instead of letting the visuals speak for themselves Disney decided that characters talking to each other (at the audience) as a means of delivering exposition was too obvious so instead this dialogue is sung. The songs are exposition. Rarely do they allow any visual storytelling to stand alone. John Smith's first encounter with Pocahontas at the waterfall being the best example of what the film could have been if only.

Despite being historically-inaccurate (why is she not topless?) it really only details the first half of the Pocahontas story. The second (and more tragic) half is (sorta) detailed in the cash- grab sequel that nobody remembers. I cannot imagine anyone being smitten by this film unless they are already familiar with Pocahontas as the stripped-down story is hardly likely to win over anyone new to this slice of romantic history."
Things to Do in Denver when You're Dead (1995),"I CAN imagine telling someone this film is 'a reputable film of inherently admirable qualities' - a wide-ranging score, sharp cinematography, a beautiful elegiac tone and a killer script all provide the foundations for one of the most surprising films I've seen. Andy Garcia's A-list performance is superbly supported by a host of brilliantly- cast characters, with Treat Williams, Christopher Lloyd and the malevolent

Christopher Walken outstanding.

The whole film just sits really well - all the small background details help the plot, flesh out the characters and culture or provide telling counterpoints to the situation.

Highly recommended, for those who like their films stylish, well-acted and

intelligent."
Broken Arrow (1996),"Usually I'm the first person to label this sort of movie. Look at it. It's got the usual assortment of cliches and conventions. The John Woo directed action scenes stretch over the top. There's a mentally unstable talkative nemesis, a predictable betrayal and even one of those bombs that graces us with a digital readout. All prerequisites for movies of a certain quality and after saying all that - I'd usually be complaining about now.

Yet for one reason I can't. This movie really entertained me. It finds a way to come together in a really enjoyably manner and I'm happy with what I got. I can't bad mouth it. Nothing got in my way of everlasting enjoyment of seeing baddies die, bombs going off and the baritone guitar instrumental. It just all clicks from the get-go.

If your reading this you don't need me to recycle the plot summary. It's of a trivial nature. Good action, decent cast and a fun atmosphere go a long way with Travolta ultimately holding it all together. He plays his role to the hilt and delivers some fantastic lines. Him and Slater tango pretty well too. Travolta makes for a great bad guy and good action movies require great bad guys. Chances are anyone else in Broken Arrow and you'd be reading a completely different review. A guilty pleasure if there ever was one."
"NeverEnding Story III, The (1994)","Imagine that you are reading an entertainment magazine like ""Entertainment Weekly"" or ""Rolling Stone"", and you happen to look in the news section where they give you information about a movie that is in production. It is a children's movie distributed by Miramax, who has made dozens of Oscar-winning films over the last 30 years. It has special effects by Cinemagic and the Jim Henson Creature Shop, and Jack Black stars in it. You would want to see it, right? Well, not if it's ""The NeverEnding Story III"".

""The NeverEnding Story III"" is disappointing in every sense of the word. It is by far one of the worst sequels ever made, and it does a disservice to the book by Michael Ende and the original 1984 film on which it is based (My review: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088323/usercomments-250).

This movie takes characters from the book and creates a new story that is full of plot holes, bad puns, and very little logic whatsoever. It helps very little that none of the cast members from either of the first two movies were involved in this film.

This time, Bastian is played by Jason James Richter (""Free Willy"" (1993)). Although Richter looks like a preteen model, he is still harassed by a gang at his new school known as the Nasties (or the Nastys) whose leader is Slip, played by a then-unknown Jack Black.

As it turns out, Bastian's new school also happens to be where Coreander, the owner of the book store in the original story, works as a librarian. British actor Freddie Jones plays Coreander in this movie, and fans of the original may be disappointed not to see Thomas Hill reprise his role. I don't blame them.

Anyway, Coreander happened to bring the NeverEnding Story with him to this school library. It's a pretty contrived way to bring the book back into the story after the main character has moved away if you ask me.

What's even more contrived is when Bastian, hiding from the Nastys, retreats into the world of Fantasia, only to have Slip retrieve the book, realize its powers, and try to destroy the world and Bastian. In the book and the first two movies, the reader had little to no control over how the NeverEnding Story would be told. How the Nastys get control is never explained anywhere in the movie. The NeverEnding Story being an enchanted book is no excuse to cover up such plot holes.

When Bastian realizes he has to re-enter the real world to obtain the book and save Fantasia, the movie just gets worse. Even with the Oren (the token worn around the neck that resembles two snakes), Bastian alone can't make it back home. So a number of creatures from Fantasia have to wish with him, and be transported into his world, for him to save Fantasia.

Such a subplot wouldn't be so bad if the supporting characters weren't so annoying and intelligence insulting. There's the Rock-Biter's baby boy who talks in annoying ""baby talk"" that real children under 3 don't use as vernacular, an anthropomorphic tree who talks like an old Jewish comedian except not as funny, and two gnomes (Urgl and Engywook, featured in the first movie but played by different actors) who have a tired running joke about needing to use the bathroom.

Oh yes, and who could forget Falcor, the luck dragon? In the first two movies, Falcor was a hero to Atreyu and Bastian, and was the voice of reason in many situations. He also had a voice like Walter Cronkite, which made him ever cooler. Here, he not only looks different from the previous two films, but he's whinier and dumber. When, in the real world, he mistakes an airplane for a female luck dragon, I could only hang my head and wonder, ""Why?"".

To make matters worse, Bastian can't wish the book back after the Nastys stole it because he can't use the Oren to make wishes in the real world. That plot point is well and good, and makes a setup for a great conflict that adds to the story. Unfortunately, the people who wrote this screenplay forget that plot point and failed to explain why Bastian's stepsister Nicole (Melody Kay) could make wishes when she had possession of the Oren. Any script reviser could point out these plot holes, and it most especially amazes me that filming progressed despite these inconsistencies.

It is even more amazing that no one in this movie actually acts poorly. Richter does well in his role, despite his voice obviously cracking and no one noticing. I don't bring that point up to be mean. It's just that the filmmakers could have used his voice changing as a good subplot to explain why he's being picked on. But I digress.

The point is that everyone involved in this film just could not save the story having so many inconsistencies. By the end, the story bears no resemblance to Ende's original book at all. The Fantasia creatures are also too annoying, trying too hard to be comic relief and inundating their dialogue with uncharacteristic pop culture references. Case in point: the Rock Biter rides his bike while singing ""Born To Be Wild"" by Steppenwolf. What were these filmmakers thinking?

And you would think that the Jim Henson Creature Shop working on your side would be a valuable asset in this film. In this case, none of the recurring characters look like they did in the first two movies (the Rock Biter, looking like a pint-size version of his predecessor, was the biggest disappointment), and they weren't strong characters either. They did not live up to Henson's high standards of storytelling and development. If you don't believe me, try finding this movie on Muppet Central. You would have had better luck finding this film in a theater that ran it for two weeks back when it was released."
Rob Roy (1995),"As a Cinematic Experience, 'Rob Roy' is decent, but if you're clearly looking to see some fine acting, 'Rob Roy', just might do the trick. This 1995 Historical Drama has Liam Neeson & Tim Roth delivering performances that are so sharp & effective, that, they even manage to the hold the film, when it falters.

Directed by Michael Caton-Jones, 'Rob Roy' stars Neeson as Robert Roy MacGregor, the famous Scottish folk hero and outlaw of the early 18th century, who battled with feudal landowners in the Scottish Highlands.

Robert Roy MacGregor's Journey On-Screen, is decent in parts. The Writing Material is slow and slightly deary in the first-hour, but picks up the second-hour and reaches to a memorable culmination. Michael Caton-Jones's direction is satisfactory. Cinematography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub is stunning. Editing is fair.

Performance-Wise: As told, Neeson & Roth rule the show with their sharp & effective performances. Neeson gets into the skin of the character, and plays a robin-hood of his time perfectly. Roth, on the other-hand, plays the bad guy, most effectively. Jessica Lange is adequate. John Hurt & Brian Cox are fairly good.

On the whole, A Must See for Neeson & Roth Fans!"
Species (1995),"Ah finally! An excuse to stare at gorgeous boobs, cleverly disguised as Sci-Fi cinema! Well maybe that's a tad bit exaggerated but, still, the multiple sequences in which Natasha Henstridge walks around topless are unquestionably the most memorable moments of the entire movie. In her debut role, stunning Natasha plays a secret government project, namely the very first scientific hybrid of human and alien DNA. During the opening sequences, she's still a teenage girl but already incredibly strong and too dangerous to keep alive any longer. When project leader Fitch (Ben Kinsley) attempts to destroy her with gas, she escapes on a train and Michelle Williams transforms into Natasha Henstridge. What's the sole thing on a sexy blond alien's mind when she drifts through L.A. all by herself? Procreate, of course, and thus Sil (her codename) hooks up with random men as she's looking for the perfect sperm donor. Meanwhile, Fitch assembles an elite squad that'll be charged with hunting down Sil and annihilate her before she copulates the entire male population to death. ""Species"" is a pretty bad movie, yet horror and Sci-Fi fans will definitely find it entertaining due to its large amount of gore and trashy sleaze. The action-sequences are well illustrated and exciting but, as soon the script tries to be intellectual, the whole thing looks stupid and dreary. Especially the characters don't make much sense. Michael Madsen is (again) supposed to be a tough and merciless bounty hunter, but he has a gingerbread heart and falls for a dull female doctor. Kingsley is profiled to be the cold and heartless scientist but he can't even force his authority on a four-headed crew? Oh, and Forest Whitaker is the lousiest spiritual medium ever! ""Something has happened here"", he says whilst staring at the bloody aftermath inside the train carriage. Well duh! You're staring at corpse and the juicy leftovers of an alien cocoon! The special effects are blobby and they regularly brought back memories of cheap B-movies from the 80's, which was nice. Like I said, ""Species"" is a lot of fun as long as none of the characters open their mouths to speak."
"Walk in the Clouds, A (1995)","I was stuck watching this on a 5 hour flight so I had plenty of time to review and re-review this movie in my head. I guess this is a love story but I'm not sure at all how the Keana Reeves ultimately became attached to the leading lady.

The gist of the story - The leading lady is pregnant and the father of the unborn child has disappeared. She has to go home with the shame and gets on a bus where she meets Keanu. They talk and Keanu decides to go with her with under the guise of meeting and making her family believe he's a bum by running out on her. However, things don't go as planned and by movie's end, they're in love and everything works out.

The story to me was like mashed potatoes, all the potatoes get thrown together and you get a final product, in this case a not very cohesive movie. The point I'm getting at is that this movie does a poor job at telling it's story. It appears that the director must have took a day off and let their assistant(s) finish shooting the film. I think there are plenty of undiscovered scripts waiting to be discovered and filmed - too bad some one didn't find one to replace this yawner.

I'm still puzzled about the grapes though..."
Waterworld (1995),"Waterworld (1995)

*** (out of 4)

Talk all you want about how this thing was a bomb at the box office. I've personally never seen how good or poorly a movie does at the box office should have any impact on its entertainment or quality level. Is WATERWORLD flawless? Not even close. There are countless problems with this film but for the most part I've always enjoyed its ambition and it keeps me entertained. The story is pretty simple as in the future all the world is covered by water, although there's rumors of land somewhere. A part-man, part-fish (Kevin Costner) gets involved with a family (Jeanne Tripplehorn, Tina Majorino) and soon must defeat some bad guys (led by Dennis Hopper) who has kidnapped the girl. WATERWORLD runs on a bit too long, loses focus on any type of story and yes the budget was crazy but in the end it's still a pretty entertaining summer blockbuster. I think a lot of credit has to go to the actual look of the film, which of course turned out to be some of the biggest issues with the production. I thought the director managed to do a good job creating a world where the viewer really did feel was nothing but water. The futuristic atmosphere also worked and the look of the costumes, ships and supplies were all realistic and fun. The action scenes were also extremely well handled and especially the ending with all the explosions and fires. The battles at sea were really just things we had previously seen in pirate movies but they were still fun. Costner also turns in a good, not great, performance in the lead and he at least keeps you interested in everything going on. Hopper delivers that crazy type of performance we all love and Tripplehorn is good in her supporting bit. Majorino is also fun as the young girl who befriends Costner. I remember watching this when it was originally released and everyone was going crazy about the budget. Everyone seemed to forget that the people leaving the theater actually liked the movie. It's too bad WATERWORLD was doomed from the start but it remains a fun movie."
Wild Bill (1995),"This film presents the viewer with an odd perspective on the psychedelic West, but as MGM's answer to Disney's/BuenaVista's ""Tombstone,"" it falls flat on its face. It failed at the box office, and it fails to convey any resemblance to a modernized western. Actually, this plays more like Andy Kaufman meets Quentin Tarantino in Deadwood.

That combination may sound like fun, and at times, it is, but for the most part, this is one convoluted mess that cannot live up to the name Wild Bill Hickock, though it is slick and stylish in its development and execution.

Jeff Bridges was one bright spot in this work, while there are other bright spots, they are matches next to his spotlight.

All in all? I was entertained, if somewhat aghast.

It rates a 4.8/10 from...

the Fiend :."
Farinelli: il castrato (1994),"The sets and costumes are magnificent and give a 21st century viewer a glimpse of what life must have been like for the fortunate wealthy in the days of the baroque composers, but the story is confusing and there was far too much gratuitous sex. It was as if the filmmakers did not think that the beautiful music and sumptuous settings could carry the film. I don't know if something was lost in the subtitling, or whether too much film was left on he cutting room floor, but I was baffled by a number of the characters. Who was Benjamin and why did he wear a body brace? Who were Alexandra and Margareth? The characters simply seemed to be a device to move the story along to the bizarre and unnecessary sex scenes.

My biggest problem was with the poor lip synching, which was so obvious that it distracted and spoiled the flow of the film. It was not just that the facial mannerisms did not match the voice, but that the volume actually dropped to the extent that the voice seemed to be coming from off stage. Nowhere was this worse than the trumpet scene at the beginning. The castrati had very powerful voices, but Farinelli's voice sounds like a far-off squeak. Synching has been done very successfully in the past, most notably by Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady and Ava Gardner is Show Boat, and most famously by Edmund Purdom in the Student Prince, so it should not be beyond the capability of film makers 40 or more years later. I felt that the film would have been more convincing if Farinelli had been played by a soprano doing her own singing, and had concentrated more on the relationship with the brother who was riding on Farinelli's coat tails. How often have we seen a partnership where one half is nothing without the other, and knows it.

As for the comparison with the decadent rock star life style, that is how the castrati stars allegedly lived in the hedonistic 18th-century. I am not sure either that the castrati strutted around the stage like drag queens as they were supposed to be playing the women's parts as women. Given Ken Russell’s record of appallingly bad taste portrayals of musicians, it is surprising that he never attempted this one. It was right up his street.

Opera lovers would be better served by listening to recordings of Handels operas."
Heavenly Creatures (1994),"I really liked this film. Like the overwhelming majority of people, I didn't know about the real crime behind the story of this film, where the friendship between two teenagers turns into a sexual and romantic obsession and leads the two young women to kill the mother of one of them, in hope that they can run away or stay together.

Directed by Peter Jackson, still a long way from dreaming that he would be as successful as ""The Lord of the Rings"", the film is excellent and does a great job in terms of recreating the events and psychology of the two central characters. Of course, according to what I've read, the facts are not entirely clear as to the nature of the relationship the two girls had, but it seems quite clear that, at the very least, there was a very strong obsession between them and a certain dissociation from reality. , through the creation of a fantasy alternative world that functioned as an escape. The film shows us this clearly and manages to maintain a certain ambiguity where it seems most necessary.

This was the debut film for young Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynksey. None of them seem exactly like newcomers or inexperienced in the cinematographic art, which can only be a revealing parameter of talent, and of the great qualities that both have revealed since then, most especially Winslet, who has dedicated more time to cinema and achieved a different level of recognition. In addition to them, we also have the excellent performances by Sarah Peirse, Clive Morrison and Diana Kent, in the role of three of the paternal figures.

Technically, the film doesn't have any major problems. The pace is ideal, there are no dead moments or situations that seem to be too much or to have been stilted, and the editing is very good and well executed. The cinematography is excellent, with great color and light, particularly in the fantasy scenes, where we enter the fantastic world that these young women created for themselves. The sets are good and, together with the costumes, recreate the period portrayed with verisimilitude. The filming locations are magnificent, very well selected and used. The soundtrack is equally good."
Interview with the Vampire (1994),"'Interview with the Vampire' is exactly as the title indicates. A reporter interviews a vampire, Louis, and we learn about his life and loves through his retellings. Brad Pitt stars as Louis, a man who tragically lost his family and in the process lost his desire to live. Antagonist vampire Lestat (Tom Cruise) came to his rescue. Or did he? Did het not condemn him to eternal misery instead of saving him?

Indeed so. We see Louis battling coming to terms with his new life - that as a vampire. Although Louis and Lestat are now both vampires, they couldn't be more different, and I found this an interesting approach to the age old vampire traditions and traits. I once read writer Anne Rice was upset upon learning Cruise was cast as Lestat, being ""the wrong person for the role."" However, Cruise is so fantastic as Lestat that she personally apologized to him afterwards. Tom Cruise truly is incredible in this film. For someone who was supposedly one of the most unlikely candidates for the role, Cruise seems all too perfect!

'Interview with the Vampire' is a stylish film with great costumes and cinematography, with beautiful settings and production design. The make-up is also excellent. There are a lot of very disturbing images, though, and a lot of blood sucking scenes - many of which are gross. Due to the graphic nature of the film it certainly is not recommended for everyone, and most definitely not for kids. You're going to have to choose your audience well with this film.

'Interview with the Vampire' is still one of my favorite vampire movies, providing loads of thrills, chills, action and adventure. I love it!"
"Kid in King Arthur's Court, A (1995)","I thought this movie was cute when I was about 10, but now that I look at it i realize how stupid the whole thing is. there is not an educated person alive that can honestly say that they could walk back into the middle ages and save an entire kingdom all by themselves, theyd get there ass kicked. First of all, if this kid managed to survive the first 5 minutes without getting an arrow put through him or beheaded by a broadsword, and he managed to avoid being taken prisoner and made a gay soliders plaything, he would most likely die of many diseases that his body wasn't accustomed to. Also, even you do have a magical place to plug in a stereo you play rock and roll for guards at a middle age castle, youll be labled as a heritic and executed. but dying aside, the middle ages just werent that cool, disease and warfare were everywhere, people lived in disgusting conditions that even mother theresa would run away from, and there was no place for the weak, you either fought or you died and if you werent tough, you were probably killed. But enough about that, what i have to say is for young kids that enjoy the ""kids outsmarting the stupid grownups"" genre, like home alone (that ones off the hook though, still entertains me even at 19 and will continue to) go see it, but for older people that know what the middle ages were really like, dont bother.

If you want a closer to real life version of what a person time traveling would be like, read the scottish highlander book series (highlander, the fiery cross, etc) or listen to the recorded books tape or cd"
Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1994),"This interpretation of the story ""Frankenstein"", with personalities like Kenneth Brannagh,Ian Holmes,Helena-Bonham Carter and John Cleese amongst others is so incredible in its execution and dramatic flare.

John Cleese,especially,makes a very memorable part as the mysterious mentor Professor Waldman,which shows Frankenstein the secrets of Life.

And not to forget Kenneth Brannaghs characterization of the manic, desperate and not too forget intense Dr. Victor Frankenstein is completely without competition.

It's in this part Brannaghs sense of Dramatical flare and theatrical intensity really comes into its right, and manages to put the madness of Frankenstein into an incredible sharp relief.

You get an understanding of why Frankenstein does what he does.. The Death of his mother,the want to beat Death, all of these factors formed Frankenstein up to the moment where he creates and reanimates the Monster

Ah, The Monster.. In all the excitement I almost forget Robert De Niro's excellent rendition of the monster. In his characterization the monster isn't just a lifeless and soulless being,but a humane being with wishes,desires,wants and lusts..

He feels and experiences everything with such a strenght and intensity as noone really can describe. And he tries to adapt to a world which is completely hostile to his existence, even his Father he learns will not love him or know him.

The Monster is like a child, trying to cope with emotions and feelings much stronger than anything we can imagine or percieve. And maybe it is that which makes the Monster so reckognizable?. Because he is us, and we are him?"
"Quick and the Dead, The (1995)","""The Quick and the Dead"" is a ""splatter Western,"" directed by horror vet Sam Raimi (whose latest, as of this writing, is ""Spider-Man,"" but who cut his teeth on the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy). It's set in the oh-so-ironically named lawless town of Redemption, a haven of grotesques that gives us an idea what the wild West would've looked like if had been painted, not by Frederic Remington, but by Heironymus Bosch.

In a surfeit of Biblical nomenclature, the town's mayor/owner/capo is named Herod (Gene Hackman at his oiliest, complete with bad hair). Into town there rides a mysterious stranger, not Clint Eastwood this time but Sharon Stone. I'm not the world's biggest Stone fan, but this movie and ""Total Recall"" indicate that she has her uses in kick-butt action roles that make no demands on her limited thespianic skills. As gunslinger Ellen, she's doubly armed--with a six-shooter, and with an axe to grind; even her ""inner child"" packs a gun. She enters Herod's to-the-death fast-draw tournament, a no-win, no-exit, potentially no-survivors affair, with an agenda on her mind other than just winning the prize money.

This is an overripe, over-wrought movie, but it mostly works. Raimi all but erases the slim wall between the horror and Western genres: Redemption is another Transylvanian village of simple peasants lorded over by by an evil baron, and the atmosphere--palpably oppressive and claustrophobic--could be cut with a knife. Leonardo di Caprio and veteran character actors Lance Henriksen and Roberts Blossom effectively round out the cast, and the action scenes--exaggerated, mythic, often darkly humorous--deliver. If you're more of a horror fan than a Western fan, this may be the Western for you."
Tales from the Hood (1995),"TALES FROM THE HOOD is an anthology of horror vignettes which transplants the concept of TALES FROM THE CRYPT (1972) to a setting in which contemporary social problems which disproportionately affect African Americans are used as central plot devices.

The original 'Tales from the Crypt' was a comic series in the early 1950s. There were concerns by puritanically-minded parents that the subversive aspects of these types of comics could corrupt the minds of children. A book written in 1954 by a psychiatrist, 'Seduction of the Innocent' greatly amplified these fears, and eventually Senate Subcommittee hearings were held on this matter. This eventually led to the formation of the Comics Code Authority, which issued the 'Comics Code' a set of rules by which publishers of comics would voluntarily abide.

By today's standards, the Comics Code is hilarious in its ludicrous austerity, but publishers used it to censor themselves for decades. It only became completely defunct in 2011. The research on which 'Seduction of the Innocent' was based has been largely discredited.

TALES FROM THE CRYPT (1972) began a long succession of movie and television adaptations, some of which were based on the original stories of the comics, and some of which were original. The film is an anthology of vignettes which all basically follow the same format: One person (or more) does something bad, and then they get their comeuppance in a most horrific manner by supernatural means. The vignettes are connected to each other by an overarching story in which they are actually narrations by a main character called the 'Crypt Keeper' to an audience, and the conclusion involves the revelation of a connection between the audience members and the stories told. Although heavy-handed and often bordering on the silly, the movie's greatest strength is its creepy, engaging atmosphere.

It turns out that the greatest asset of TALES FROM THE HOOD is also its atmosphere. The entire structure of TALES FROM THE CRYPT is adopted, almost without change, to tell stories which center on real social problems. The Crypt Keeper is replaced by a creepy mortician who tells these stories to a gang of thugs who are there to pick up a load of drugs he had found.

Within the overarching story 'Welcome to my Mortuary', there are four vignettes:

1.'Rogue Cop Revelation' is the story of a black ex-cop who quit his job after he did nothing to stop a trio of corrupt cops from murdering and framing a black activist. Of all the vignettes, this has the strongest vibe reminiscent of 1970s blaxploitation horror.

2.'Boys do get Bruised' tells of a young boy who keeps coming to school with bruises. When a concerned teacher tries to find out who did it, he says that it was a ""monster"" The teacher, obviously skeptical, goes to the boy's home to speak to his guardians, and finds out more than he expected.

3.'KKK Comeuppance' follows the haunting of a David Duke-type racist politician (actually named ""Duke"") who had made his political headquarters in a plantation home that was the location of a mass killing of African Slaves.

4.""Hard Core Convert"" explores the fate of a hardened criminal in prison who is given a second chance by undergoing behavior modification therapy strongly reminiscent of that in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE (1971). (This segment includes rapid flash sequences which might be unsuitable for some people who suffer from seizures).

Although there is variation in the quality of the stories, it is less so than the original TALES. However, the same kind of heavy-handedness and border-line silliness can also be found here. What helps a lot is that this movie has a good sense of humor, more than was in CRYPT, which reminds us not to take it too seriously. Another aspect that elevates it relative to the original is that the situations, however unrealistic, are based on real social issues.

There are definitely things to criticize in this film, but the deliciously over-the-top performance by Clarence Williams as the mortician, makes up for a lot of that. It is clear that this film is an homage to 70s horror. As a fan of that subgenre, I appreciate that."
Village of the Damned (1995),"This movie, which holds its own, is a remake of the 1960 film classic, which in turn was based on the book ""The Midwich Cuckoos"". This John Carpenterized version is a tad more gory and more colorful than the 1960 version.

The small town of Midwich one-day falls inexplicably asleep. Many accidents occur due to sudden narcolepsy, which is exaggerated in John Carpenter style. The result is that several of the village females including a virgin are in a motherly way. They all have their bouncing white hair babies the same day and as with the cuckoo eggs, they are too in love to notice the little quirks about having to control or mentally punish everyone. Compound this by other villages that fall to the same fate and you have an epidemic that threatens to wipe out the human race.

What action can be taken?

Is it too late?

Clear and Present Danger (1994),"Tom Clancy's CIA analyst character Jack Ryan not only made an impact on the page, he also made an impact on the big screen as well. In the 1990 smash THE HUTN FOR RED October, as played by Alec Baldwin, he was in a race against time to find out whether a renegade Soviet submarine captain was out to defect to America, or out to launch. Then in 1992's PATRIOT GAMES, Ryan, then portrayed by Harrison Ford, went into action to protect his own family against the machinations of vengeful ultra-violent Irish Republican Army terrorists. And then in 1994, again with Ford more than capably assuming the role, Ryan found himself in a pickle much closer to his job: covert military action related to the ongoing Latin American drug war in CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER.

Ford's Jack Ryan is put into action into finding the root causes of why one of the closest friends of the President (Donald Moffatt) was killed on his boat in the Caribbean Sea. As it turns out, the president's dead friend had stolen money from a Colombian drug kingpin (Miguel Sandoval), like six hundred forty million dollarsand change. For Ford, this may seem like a fairly routine matter, as is him having to go to Congress to get authorization to fund the Colombian government's war against drug cartels like Sandoval's. But unbeknownst to him, Moffatt, along with his national security adviser (Harris Yulin) and deputy CIA director (Henry Czerny) have hatched a covert operation called Operation Reciprocity to finish off the drug war on American terms, sending a paramilitary unit commanded by a man named Clark (Willem Dafoe) into the hot zone. More importantly, when his mentor Admiral Greer (James Earl Jones) falls victim to inoperable pancreatic cancer that ultimately kills him, the weight of the world falls on his shoulders. Dafoe's team does score hits against Sandoval's operation; but the end result is a series of horrific acts of retribution, including the killing of an FBI team sent to assist Ford, followed by the capture of Dafoe's men by an associate of Sandoval's (Joaquin De Almeida) out to take over Sandoval's operation.

Once Ford makes himself aware of the kind of paramilitary finagling that had been going on behind his back, he becomes a fighter once more—not for just his family, but the truth. This means having not only to go back down to the Colombian war zone to rescue Dafoe and his men, but also having to confront a president who has bent, and maybe even broken the law, for political points, and made decisions that resulted in massive losses of lives.

Philip Noyce, who had also directed PATRIOT GAMES, returns to the director's chair for this well made and, at close to two and a half hours, epic action/suspense thriller. Not surprisingly, Ford delivers the kind of performance that could easily be classified as a ""thinking man's action hero"" as Ryan, acting not on impulse or an urge for explosions of violence, but a vigilant search for the truth. Ultimately, he wonders, exactly what does constitute a ""clear and present danger"" in the real world? Is it what the president says it is, when it is in the form of drug cartels (who, by the early 2000s, proliferated far closer to the U.S., in rural sections of Mexico)? Or is the real clear and present danger found in a host of decisions merely meant to gain political points? Ford's performance remains the centerpiece of this film, but Sandoval and De Almeida make for a pair of crafty (but non-stereotypical) South American heavies (much of the film was shot in Mexico), and there are also underhanded performances by Yulin and, most especially Czerny, the latter of whom is absolutely oily and corrupt (he would play a similar role only two years later in MISSION IMPOSSIBLE). And when he is not recycling his scores for ALIENS and PATRIOT GAMES, James Horner's score is extremely effective too, veering from typically stirring patriotic Americana to ethnic South American motifs (with pan flutes).

Far too many action films from the 1980s onward are all about spectacle, and almost no suspense or substance. But CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER has a lot of those two important things in spades, and still ranks as one of the best films of the action genre during the 1990s."
Wes Craven's New Nightmare (1994),"The First Nightmare on Elm Street was scary and original. It had the great idea of a killer killing people in their dreams. All of its sequels (except for part 2, which went in a horrible direction) just built on to that idea, and the idea wasn't scary anymore as the series progressed. Now with New Nightmare, Wes Craven came up with another original idea. It turns out that Freddy is in fact real, some kind of ancient evil that took the form of Freddy Krueger and could only be contained through storytelling, IE: the Nightmare On Elm Street movies. But since the series has ended, the genie is out of the bottle, and this ingenious film unravels.

I wouldn't say this movie is that scary, it's more creepy than it is scary, but I love its imagination. It plays mind little mind games and you wonder what is real and what is not. Freddy Krueger is even credited as ""himself"". It's a must-see for any Freddy fan and in many ways it stands on its own...but only if you've seen the other movies. If that makes any sense.

This is one of the best sequels in the Nightmare series and it's nothing short of brilliant. It's nice to see that Freddy is back in the bottle where he belongs, and hopefully will be for a long time...

My Rating: 9/10"
Speed (1994),"I saw the movie and, as in many action movies, found it to be bad.

Sandra Bullock is driving the bus with a smile. I think in such situations nobody has a smile.

The plot is weak, most characters are weak, ...

The bus ""flying"" over the missing part of the road has been done earlier (taxi). I can't imagine a bus can actually do this without any damage.

On the airport the bus is driving over something that is on the ground. Strange as the runway should always be clean.

And why has Jack to fasten the metro train to let it be derailed? Isn't it much easier to decrease the speed so it stops? I can't believe they did not get hurt at all at the end of the movie.

Howard called a few times with a phone. Why didn't they track that number the first/second time he called?

This movie is full of errors and mistakes. Many of them could have been avoided."
Wolf (1994),"WOLF is worthwhile just to watch JACK NICHOLSON have fun with the character of a man who has been bitten by a wolf and begins taking on the abilities (and some additional hair) of the keenly aware animal. He shows with a flair of his nostrils that he's assuming a new self awareness and sense of smell that comes with developing animal traits. That takes up about the first half of the movie.

It's when the plot goes into overdrive that we get into trouble. We witness him outsmarting a phony co-worker (JAMES SPADER, who seems to specialize in being nasty), and watch how he manipulates his boss (CHRISTOPHER PLUMMER) with his new skills.

It's a fascinating idea but doesn't get full development in the screenplay once the wolf has made its mark on Nicholson. Instead it becomes increasingly apparent that the writers were running low on ideas and the story was getting just a little too preposterous for comfort.

Still, if you're a JACK NICHOLSON fan, you owe it to yourself to see this one. MICHELLE PFEIFFER makes good eye candy but not much else can be said about her acting skills here."
Wyatt Earp (1994),"Nicholas Earp (Gene Hackman) is the patriarch of the family. To him, only blood matters and everybody else is just a stranger. The family including Wyatt Earp (Kevin Costner) goes out west after the end of the civil war. Years later, he goes back to Missouri and marries Urilla Sutherland (Annabeth Gish). When she dies, he is depressed and aimlessly roams the country. Eventually it culminates into the legendary gunfight at the OK Corral with Doc Holliday (Dennis Quaid).

Kevin Costner is fine as a younger Wyatt still searching for a direction. He's not so great as the drunken mess. Later he's OK as the lawman. He has the righteousness but not necessarily the gravitas. It's asking a lot to play this wide range for anybody.

The biggest problem is the general long winding life story. This is long, epic, and very long. It's like a biopic from a historian. It is too rambling and unfocused. Director Lawrence Kasdan does a good job filming the movie but this long biopic will always have problems. It's too rambling to create much tension or pick up any pacing. It's just overly ambitious."
Another Stakeout (1993),"The first time I saw Another Stakeout was on opening night back in 1993. I had just gone through a nasty divorce and was living out of my Saturn. And I was floored by this movie. As the final credits rolled I applauded so loudly and hard that I bruised the bone in my left palm and several movie goers murmured ""He must be drunk..."" I finally stood up and yelled ""You're drunk and stupid if you didn't get this masterpiece."" I didn't leave the theater and sat there through three more consecutive showings. And I haven't looked back ever since.

And with the exception of the one time I had a stroke while watching Another Stakeout and wasn't discovered for two days while I stared at a paused image of Dreyfuss and Estevez, I have enjoyed all 428 times I have seen this movie.

This film isn't just funny, action packed and filled with characters we can relate to, it's a world we find ourselves wishing we could live in rather than the dark and nasty one we currently reside in. And though we quote the movie and dress up as characters from it every Halloween the sad truth is that the world doesn't work like Another Stakeout. When you watch someone through a window of their home you don't end up falling in love and there isn't a buddy next to you to crack wise with. The police show up and people yell and cry...

Ordinarily I say ""to each his own"" when it comes to opinions about movies, but if you don't like AS 2 then you're not worth a cup of feces with a cigarette butt in it."
Blown Away (1994),"This is one of the few films that so alienated me when saw it that I whispered to my wife ""this movie isn't doing it for me"" less than a quarter of the way in, a sentiment with which she concurred. The film is in trouble from the opening shot, in which the camera pans over a rocky, wave-swept shore before settling over a moonlit prison which is obviously a model. ""Inside"" the ""prison"" is a far- from-model prisoner, Ryan Gaerity. Played by a long-haired, Gaelic-speaking (both for this scene only) Tommy Lee Jones, he fatally stabs his cellmate, then combines chemicals he's hidden in various places, including inside himself (yuck), and using the cell's filthy toilet (more ""yuck"") as a casing , he sets of an explosion that blasts a large hole in the stone wall (rather than doing something sensible like destroying the much more fragile toilet). Having gotten out of the cell block in about the most conspicuous way imaginable, the movie asks the audience to believe he then gets away scot-free.

The action then shifts to Boston, where crack bomb squad member Jimmy Dove (Jeff Bridges) is on a tough assignment. A young woman's estranged boyfriend has rigged her computer with explosives which will detonate if she stops typing or the computer's drive runs out of space, then shot himself (making this murder/suicide the only one ever in which the suicide part is done first). The rest of the bomb squad brings in a robot to take over the typing, but when the robot malfunctions, Jimmy shoos everyone else and the robot out of the room and puts the poor woman back behind the keyboard; one of the cops could have done this, but you gotta have a damsel in distress (groan). As Jimmy gets to work on the computer/bomb, the sight of the shot-dead man on the floor causes him to have a vivid flashback of an injured woman lying on the ground and calling ""Liam"", to let the audience know ""Jimmy"" has a secret. The flashback trigger is bizarre, since other than the horizontal position of the person, nothing else is the same. Plus, the flashback is in black and white; is Jimmy/Liam color blind? Wouldn't that be a serious handicap in his line of work?

The film continues in this illogical vein, with the shared past of the two main characters revealed, lots of bombs, some explosions, convoluted twists and turns, weird photography, cliches, shifting characters, bad writing, and overacting. In a film about bombs, the film itself was the biggest bomb of all. The film ""Speed"", released around the same time (keeping with that odd 1990's pattern of two movies with the same subject matter being released close together) had plenty of flaws, but worked a whole lot better than this film. A case study in bad cinema."
Body Snatchers (1993),"Another version of the 1958 classic, which was previously updated in 1978.

This time the story is set on a military base where Steve Malone moves in with his family. His job to look for toxins that might be at high levels in the grounds of the base, but soon strange things begin to happen and certain people ""aren't themselves anymore."" People who have seen the previous two versions know exactly what this means. However, whether you know or not the film manages to be an eerie thriller in parts. There is a change in perspective from the previous two versions as the focus here is more on the family, but it still remains in subtle ways as a parable. But it is that family aspect that gives this version its push. The examination of trust and mistrust within the family unsentimental and compelling. Carol's monologue to her husband Steve in a key moment will literally make you grow goosebumps. And the end, which will be familiar to those of you who've seen the previous version, has it's own spin and take on the situation and what led up to it. The way hope and despair are mixed and shown makes the ending worth seeing, but unexpectedly abrupt. Though, abrupt in this case means ""chilling."" That makes it not quite the first which ended in despair. Different from the second which was chilling, but final moment was that of terror. Here it is... just chilling.

Then the special effects are pretty good too with the pods getting just enough screen time to keep you thinking about what they are, but also enough to send shudders down your spine. --- 7/10

Not Rated, contains violence and horror. Ages 13+."
Boxing Helena (1993),"Dr. Nick (""Hi Everybody!"") Cavanaugh (Julian Sands) is obsessed with the sexy but incredibly unlikable Helena (Sheryl Fenn) who he once had an affair with. When she pretty much rejects the guy, she ends up being hit by a truck. Does this deter him? No! It just means that he'll amputate her and keep her for himself.

Directed by David Lynch's daughter Jennifer, ""Boxing Helena"" is a movie that at first sounds like a perverse, strange little movie. Instead, it ends up being more of a mix of a pretentious art house movie and a dull 90's soft-core flick (complete with Enigma's song ""Sadeness"" playing during a sex scene.) Worst yet, the whole thing is a mess. The acting is atrocious, with Sands playing an unlikable, uninteresting, unsympathetic and spineless man, while Fenn plays a character so bitchy that you wonder why any man would want to be with her. Even Bill Paxton (someone I normally like) is unable to lift this up any, as he is also terrible (though that's more due to the terrible script.) At least his hair is outrageously bad, though it's no match for the one Art Garfunkle (yes, THAT Art Garfunkle) has. Add a terrible ending and obvious symbolism (a bird in a cage, how clever!) to the mix, and you get a terrible movie.

Little fact: While more is known about Kim Bassinger and the movie, what is less talked about is that Madonna was also offered to play Helena, but turned it down. When the star of ""Swept Away"", ""The Next Best Thing"" and ""Shanghai Surprise"" turns the movie down, you know you have a dud."
City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly's Gold (1994),"Is this movie Oscar worthy? No. Is it fun to watch when you've got some time to kill? Yes. City Slickers II might not have the impact and lasting impression the first one has but it's still great in its own right. It's a bit cheesier than the first but there are some genuine laughs to be had.

If you're a fan of the first one you should definitely watch this one and see if you like it. Apparently some people hated it , but I think a lot of that comes from a persons expectations going into this. The first movie was touching and had some great life pointers. This one is something to watch for a good time and to see (most) of the characters you love from the first again. Only true negative I could throw out there is Bruno Kirby not returning for whatever reason. Jon Lovits is a funny addition to the team though.

Give it a shot!"
Cliffhanger (1993),"Cliffhanger is one of the best action thrillers ever made. It stars Sylvester Stallone, John Lithgow, Michael Rooker, and Janine Turner. Excellent acting and outstanding special effects really bring out the excellence in this film. Intensity and sheer terror really bring out the thrills in this film.

Sylvester Stallone is the perfect action-rescuer guy, John Lithgow is the perfect bad guy that uses guns, fiery explosives, and extreme violence to win the thing he desperately craves. I'M NOT GIVING ANYTHING AWAY! I strongly recommend that NOBODY under the age of 14 see this film. It's violence level is on the heavy scale and the language is on the extreme scale and it's terror is on the terrifying scale. There is a lot of blood and gunshots in this movie. There was a lot of 'F' words and 'motherf***er' works too. And the terror...terrifying.

This movie has non-stop action from it's frightening beginning to it's explosive conclusion. It's conclusion is explosive, but very short and very mediocre. Well, I mean the ending is literally explosive, if you know what I mean. The director could have done more with the ending. But otherwise, this movie is filled with violence and terror and fiery explosives that makes this one of the best action-adventure-thrillers ever made.

Spectacular, intense, strong, pulse-pounding, heart-stomping, throat-tightening, great, awesome, sweet, incredulous, super, brilliant, and very violent!

Coneheads (1993),"Coneheads is one of the best ""Saturday Night Live"" movies. I was expecting a light comedy but what I got was a whole lot more. Following a similar plot to the skit, Coneheads is the story about the Beldar Conehead family who crash on earth during a scouting mission for planet conquest. While here, they dodge the INS, have a child and discover that life on Earth is quite good.

This is where the movie shows its heart. It could have been a movie of comedy bits but by the end, it is about happiness in a stable family, which is quite refreshing in these days of depressing movies about divorces and unmarried couples. It is nice to see Beldar be a father figure to his daughter rather than the ""Let Your Kids Be Who They Are"" mentality of these days. The direction of the film in excellent, setting up many nice visual gags and shots that are very impressive for a comedy film. And at times, the film feels ""epic"" as you see the family on the run from the INS, to moving to the suburbs to returning to their planet.

There are great performances throughout the film and the many cameos are perfect. Look for funny scenes from Jan Hooks, Adam Sandler, Michael Richards, and Garrett Morris. Michelle Burke makes a nice debut as Connie Conehead and I expect to see more of her in the future.

On the surface, this seems like a dumb movie and it has received many poor reviews. But if you sit back and let it take you on an adventure (and if you can keep up with the way the Coneheads use different words for common items) you will be pleasantly surprised."
Demolition Man (1993),"""Somebody put me back in the fridge"". When John Spartan (Sylvester Stallone) utters that line about half way through this film, it really symbolizes (unfortunately) the kind of tone ""Demolition Man"" takes.

For a brief plot synopsis, ""Demolition Man"" begins in Los Angeles circa 1996, where policeman John Spartan is trying to corral wacko criminal Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes). Long story short, they both end up incarcerated and flash-frozen in hopes of psychological parole 40 years into the future. When that time comes, Phoenix escapes and begins to wreak havoc on a benevolent civilization that is now not capable of handling such violence. Thus, Spartan is taken ""out of the fridge"" to try and stop Phoenix by all means necessary.

Now, here is the problem with this film: Imagine the plot of a great science fiction tale (like, say, Minority Report) done in a tone like the 1960s Batman television show...pure ""camp"". At its core, this movie isn't all that bad at all, featuring a very intriguing plot, interesting characters, plenty of action, and some legitimately funny comedy. Unfortunately, the entire film was played for purely ""camp"", thus leading to groan-inducing one-liners, characters that start off interesting and quickly turn one-dimensional, and a plot that kind of meanders around without ever really delving into the interesting issues (what cryostasis is like, how the future became what it is like, morality, etc.).

Don't get me wrong...this is a fun little movie to watch. But, once again, to use the Batman analogy, who is considered the ""real"" Joker: the puffed-out Caesar Romero of TV fame, or the dark, gritty Heath Ledger of Christopher Nolan's silver screen adaptation? I thought so. Had ""Demolition Man"" taken itself a bit more seriously, it could have risen that critical notch from novelty ""eh"" to ""hey, that was a good film""."
"Englishman Who Went Up a Hill, But Came Down a Mountain, The (1995)","Despite the fact that it's about almost nothing relevant to the average movie-goer, THE ENGLISHMAN WHO WENT UP A HILL BUT CAME DOWN A MOUNTAIN manages to be a charming diversion but ultimately, it's as innocuous as its title.

Drawbacks aside, it does offer some hauntingly beautiful color cinematography of Welsh landscapes, day and night, blazing with beauty, some quaint village shots of pubs and lodgings that look invitingly cosy, and some sketchy characterizations that do little more than pad out a rather tedious little tale.

HUGH GRANT does another one of his befuddled, amused, eyebrow lifting characterizations, complete with stutter and smile and pause between words, a role he seemed destined to repeat again and again. But he fits the role and the story--which takes place in 1917 Wales.

The jaunty musical score compensates for some slow moments but all the actors do a competent job of keeping things on a realistic level. There are no big names in the cast aside from Grant, but they all make their mark while he gets most of the footage for a rather awkward romance with a local girl who spends the night on the mountain with him.

Summing up: Not much in the way of a plot, but it manages to be appealing and extremely well photographed."
Kalifornia (1993),"Pay attention to this one, it's got a lot to say. It's film noir and social criticism mixed in one. In fact, this film was probably the (unacknowledged) inspiration for the entire 'X-Files' series (which I hate), and there are a hell of a lot of similarities between them. The spooky, dark atmosphere of dread is very much the same though much more effective here. Duchovney's character--a liberal writer--does everything he can to accomodate and relate to the Pitt character (Early) and still ends up in deep trouble. The characters are all realistic and almost everything that happens is believable (as opposed to 'Blood Simple' where to achieve a few sick laughs you're asked to suspend disbelief). Pitt's performance is effective on its face as well as hilariously camp simply because of the huge star he has become since (his tongue-in-the-nudie-picture scene in the unrated version is funnier than hell). But all that's okay, for the film as a whole works on many levels and can withstand more than a few unintentional laughs to go with the intentional ones. The most touching scene is the final one, when the tape recording of Adele confessing her loneliness and deep need to be accepted humanizes her tragically and emphasizes the contrast between her (who never really had a chance) and these two yuppies (Duchovney and Forbes) who shared a portion of her tragic journey. Even after a first hand experience of true evil has tempered his liberalism and made him kill to save his life, he will have to hold on to a large portion of his original theory simply because of the overwhelming pathos generated by that final tape message."
"Piano, The (1993)","Jane Campion is a director of quiet unease. I was not a big admirer of her ""Angel At My Table"", which had enormous possibilities but was suffocated under the filmmaker's penchant for what I refer to as 'ugly beauty'. Even the beautiful passages in this film are undermined by either something ghastly, something about to become ghastly, or something borne from ghastliness. A New Zealand woman in the 1800s becomes a mail-order bride for an uninterested working man; she's a self-elected mute and communicates through her wizened little daughter (Oscar-winner Anna Pacquin, a bit over-the-top) and through her passion for playing the piano, which becomes a point of contention in her marriage. Engrossing human drama with a torrid undercurrent of sexuality and violence. Many people I've talked to about this film could not get with it, but perhaps that's the fault of watching movies at home. In the theater, this was a slightly-dazed, rapturous and enveloping brew that held me spellbound until the lights went up. Movies like this don't hold the same spell when butchered up by ads for the CBS comedies. Holly Hunter, Sam Neill and, most especially, Harvey Keitel all do terrific work. Hunter deservedly won a Best Actress Oscar. ***1/2 from ****"
Romeo Is Bleeding (1993),"A dark thriller with a hopelessness at its core that eats away at you the same way it does with Oldman. At one point his character says ""All I could think about was feed the hole, feed the hole..."" That hole represents his own private Hell, one that he created and he is perpetuating - but as long as things are going smoothly, if badly, things are OK.

One great, great scene is where Oldman casually sets his gun down on the kitchen table and Sciorra - sadly, in too small a role - picks it up and points it at him. The look on his face is priceless.

This movie has the same ethos as ""Bad Lieutenant"", but doesn't have that movie's crushing, personally wretched banality. It's also not quite as shocking or intense. Instead, it uses its main character's arrogance and sadistic tendencies as ""fatal flaws"" which ultimately help to bring down an otherwise quasi-noble guy.

I liked this movie up to a point, but sometimes it feels like I'm being manipulated - shown something shocking just for the sake of it being shocking. Like the scene with Olin and Oldman in the car that is excerpted at the beginning. A lot of that is just unnecessary. It's supposed to help set the tone, but by this time the tone has already been set - these are both desperate characters with a lot to lose and little to gain."
"Secret Garden, The (1993)","You've think a movie starring mostly pre-teens as the main cast members would be a happy-go lucky story of fairies and good and evil and yadda yadda yadda...I'll say it now, the Secret Garden isn't your average kid's storybook fairytale.

The movie, considering what you would take to be it's target audience (pre-teens), is pretty dark. Colin is dying, his mother died, Mary's parents die...yeah. For what it is, it's great. The acting is superb, the plot is engaging, and the Secret Gardner itself is astounding. The movie is full of secrets, and characters with secrets. Pretty much all the main characters have had some sort of tragedy in their lives.

It's one of those movies that you want to watch again. It's not exceptionally funny, although there are dashes of humor. Not that romance, but there is some. And no violence at all, save for maybe a few scenes. So overall...the target audience will enjoy it, and older members will enjoy it too. Odds are that anyone over age 10 will find this movie very likable."
Son in Law (1993),"This movie is one of the worse movies of all time. I'm kind of upset this movie isn't on the bottom 100; it deserves a spot at least number 60 or 70 on that list. This isn't just a film I think is bad in a campy-fun sort of MST3K way; it's just bad. This is one of the few films that I really, really HATE. Freddy Got Fingered is in the same category of bad.

So the story in this one goes that the daughter (Gugino) goes to California to go to school and comes back with Crawl (Shore) and he tries to learn to be a farmer. Then the boyfriend tries to set Shore up so that the girl will leave Crawl and go back to him. It ends and what's left of the audience can leave.

The main purpose of this movie is for Pauly Shore to mug for the camera and try to be funny; but I'd say about 100% of the time he fails at that. Their horrible inaccurate and out of date view of farms and farming is offensive and there's nothing in this movie worth seeing. If you think of seeing it: don't. The one time I saw the movie it felt like I was watching it for 5 or 6 hours. If you've already seen it; you have my sympathy."
Beauty and the Beast (1991),"This is the most amazing movie i have ever seen. Everything about it is magnificent. The music goes perfect with the scenes and mood of the film, and the characters have personalities that go with the flow of the movie. Every event leads to another one and keeps you watching. I cant even describe the overall feeling after you watch it. It will make you feel every emotion there is. There are parts where you will be angry at the movie, but another when u are happy and over joyed and yet, sad and crying your eyes out.

The old story of a young girl finding the true beauty within from a beast is captured very well. It can be told anyway but Disney really makes it the best. The animation is still beautiful even now when they have higher technology. Overall even know it is still my favorite movie and i do watch it every time i get a chance. I am practically obsessed it is so good. I do have other favorites like the little mermaid and Tarzan and the lion king but nothing can compare to this.

Every time i see it i am taken away into it until the end. I always wish that this story could somehow come true and i could be there. It makes you dream and wish and hope. The strong scenes for me are: -when the prince is just transformed into the beast and with the rose as the camera zooms away from the castle. -after Gaston proposes to belle and she runs out of the house asking for a more ""provincial life"" and lays in the grass -the library scene -and definitely the ballroom scene just fills me with joy and tears at the same time -and lastly when the beast is dying and belle mutters that she loves him

What really makes it the best is the voices too. Just listening to hte music without the movie can make you feel the same way.

i am a real Disney lover but i would highly recommend this one above all others."
"Wild Bunch, The (1969)","I got this movie on DVD at the suggestion of my brother. I admit to knowing nothing about it's director and a complete lack of familiarity with most of it's actors or the mythology behind it's production (I was born years after it was made). I can, however, safely say this: this is one of the greatest movies ever made. Every aspect of the film is flawless, from the acting to the cinematography to the script.

This is also the most truly macho of all macho movies. It's not cartoonish machismo, rather it's the kind of machismo you see in drywall hangers: no-nonsense comments like ""We're after men"" and ""Let's go"" predominate, the men don't swagger around and violence is approached (fairly) honestly. The reserved dialogue and physicality reminds me of ""Seven Samaurai"" (to which this film owes a great deal). To me, that is the highest praise that I can give a movie.

The photography is amazing: the desert looks sweltering and parched, the close-ups of actor's faces outdoes Sergio Leone and the action is probably the best ever filmed. Scorcese and Tarantino obviously owe a lot to Peckinpaw. The scene during the opening credits of ""Reservoir Dogs"" is a direct lift from this movie, just to cite one of countless examples.

The acting is on par with the direction. Robert Ryan steals the show and, c'mon, who doesn't love Ernest?

Some would poo-poo the films treatment of women, and I am not going to get involved in that debate. Just go see it because, like the best movies, it immerses you in a time and place. Smell the sage!"
Hellraiser: Bloodline (1996),"I enjoy the original 2 Hellraiser movies a lot, and Hell on Earth is somewhat of a guilty pleasure despite being a serious decline in quality.

But Bloodline is just a total muddled, disjointed mess due to extreme studio interference that has virtually nothing going for it.

Due to the availability of leaked workprints, we now have a fairly good rough cut of what the film was supposed to be like, using workprints and original footage.

It's much longer, and is 100% more cohesive and narratively makes a lot more sense, and features some super cool practical effects, and differences in some existing key scenes, that were abandoned.

It seems the studio thought horror fans are braindead and care nothing about plot or structure as long as there's plenty of gore.

The end result is just that - a dismal film that offers absolutely nothing apart from some OK effects, but even then it's nothing as good as in Hellraiser or Hellraiser 2.

It's especially infuriating when we know there was a far, far superior version of the film that existed before the studio cut it to ribbons."
Primal Fear (1996),"Following the death of an Archbishop, Aaron (Ed Norton) is seen running from the scene covered in blood. The police arrest him and presume that he's guilty. In the blue corner, we have defence lawyer Martin Vail (Richard Gere) who doesn't believe that Aaron is guilty and therefore he decides to represent him - he does this free of charge knowing that Aaron doesn't have the means to be able to pay him. In the red corner, we have prosecution lawyer Janet Venable (Laura Linney) who is a former colleague and former lover of Martin Vail. Both Vail and Venable set about in their defence and prosecution against Aaron, but who will end up prevailing?

This really was a film of two halves; I thought the first half of this film was fairly generic, someone is killed, they catch the person who they think has done it, that person protests their innocence. It's familiar territory and it had me thinking that it was just going to be a fairly standard legal thriller which wouldn't have been a bad thing, but merely would have just made it an 'average film'. It is in the second half of this film when things really pick up when certain 'discoveries' are made. The second half of the film is much more interesting, exciting, and engaging and when Vail makes this 'discovery' about his client it becomes both a blessing and a curse for Vali in the context of defending Aaron. The second half of the film focuses more on the courtroom battle and like A Few Good Men, Philadelphia, and The Lincoln Lawyer the court room scenes are well executed and fairly engaging.

Then we come to the acting and first we must start with Ed Norton; I couldn't believe that this was his debut motion picture - his performance was absolutely incredible. He's always been good in what's he's been in since, but I actually think his debut performance is one of his strongest. Gere was fairly good in a sort of sleazy and charming type way which is fairly standard for him. Linney also put in a good performance.

There were some minor problems with this film such as Vail's desire to represent Aaron (which is never really explained). I also could have done without some of the soppy moments between Vail and Venable which were cringe worthy and a bit pointless. Having said that, it's still worth watching and whilst it isn't the best legal thriller I've seen, it's still well above average."
Heavy (1995),"In southeast New York, near the border of Pennsylvania, a shy tavern cook (Pruitt Taylor Vince) is concerned about his weight after finding himself attracted to the new server, a drop-out college student (Liv Tyler). The other worker, an aging blonde (Deborah Harry), naturally feels threatened by her. Shelley Winters plays the matriarch and Joe Grifasi a drunk that hangs out at the pub.

""Heavy"" (1995) has been called the ""Marty"" of the '90s. I've never seen that one, but it stars Ernest Borgnine in a role similar to the protagonist here. While this is a character study of Victor, it also evaluates Del (Harry, aka Blondie); and the others to a lesser extent.

Del is closing in on 50 years-old, but was surely stunning back in the day. She's left to making a living at a small-time tavern with romantic options limited to a garrulous alcoholic and a quiet mama's boy.

Obviously, this is not a flick for people who require an explosion every ten minutes to keep their attention (not that there's anything wrong with that, lol). It's a mundane drama about regular people and the social dynamics thereof - their (boring) daily lives, hopes, fears, regrets, grievances and lamentations. In part, it's about people who have been caged so long they no longer know how to be free. It's similar in tone to other 90's dramas like ""Sling Blade,"" which came out the next year, and ""Limbo"" (1999). While it lacks the survival element of the latter, does it really?

The frontman of The Pixies was approached to play the part of Victor, but he declined, saying he wasn't interested in playing such a character. Regardless, he would've fit the role.

The movie runs 1 hour, 44 minutes, and was shot in southeast New York at Barryville (Victor's house); five miles northeast of there in Highland Lake (the tavern); across the border of Barryville in Shohola, Pennsylvania (the bridge); and 80 miles northeast of that area in Hyde Park, NY, on the Huson River (Culinary Institute).

GRADE: B."
"Fan, The (1996)","Although The Fan has a baseball setting with the late Candlestick Park in San Francisco, it's not a baseball story. It's the dual story of a fan obsessed with baseball and his favorite player and that same player and his performance anxiety living up to the huge amount of money the Giants are paying him.

The title role is played by Robert DeNiro and a lot of his character is taken from what Michael Douglas had earlier did in Falling Down. DeNiro is the son of the founder of the company he works for, but dad having passed away long ago, the company is in different hands. DeNiro is not cutting it as a salesman of hunting knives (no pun intended) and he's having problems with his former wife Patty D'Arbanville-Quinn over visitation with his son.

At the same time multi-million dollar acquisition Wesley Snipes is having problems living up to the hype and he's looking like a big old bust. Especially next to new Giant sensation Benicio DelToro who is carrying the team with what looks like a Most Valuable Player season. Snipes is only doing well on one front, his relationship with his young son.

As his life falls apart DeNiro starts fixating on his favorite player and what he can do to help motivate him. After that this film gets truly bizarre.

But DeNiro who probably has more disturbed characters under his creative belt than any other actor around today keeps it all real. He's matched by Wesley Snipes who plays a Barry Bonds like superstar who gets a good life lesson by the end of the film.

In fact Snipes realizes it before the film ends. As he quite realistically says, it's just a game, it's not like we're out there discovering a cure for cancer. The problem is that there are too many out there, fans like DeNiro in sports and in show business who get way too caught up in it.

Look also for nice performances by Ellen Barkin who has a sports phone-in show and John Leguizamo as Snipes's agent and the wisest guy he has around him."
"Hunchback of Notre Dame, The (1996)","It is one of the most spread messages that parents and teachers send to kids: beauty is only skin deep... And so is ugliness.

Disney already used this phrase only 5 years before making ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"". It was in ""Beauty and the Beast"", which was an adaptation of an old French tale. Coincidentally, the directors (Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise) are the same for both movies.

Here, Disney creators stay within the same culture, but they use a more mature and serious title instead: Victor Hugo's ""Notre Dame de Paris"". And that's where the danger was. How can you take a very serious, mature and dark story and make it suitable for young children? We can say, once we see the final product, that is a success, but it is far from being a masterpiece like ""Beauty"".

Some very serious themes remain from the original story. The characters (at least those who are portrayed on screen) are the same and they're very well pictured. Quasimodo, who is one of the best animated interpretations of physical ugliness since a very long time, never sends a doubt that he is one of the most gentle men of Paris. Gypsy dancer Esmeralda reveals her hot beauty without sinking into the too-sexy or the scandalous. Courageous captain Phoebus is nice too, as he shows himself as somebody who do the right thing instead of instinctively obeying to the orders.

Evidently, gypsy-hating judge Claude Frollo is here too, but as a much darker and creepier role than portrayed in the book. There isn't a single moment in the movie where Frollo isn't accompanied by darkness, rain, fire, or any other element which portrays evil. Sometimes, he is simply too much dark and terrifying to be cast in what is supposed to be a children's/family movie. In a sense, he recalls me Judge Doom in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"".

Such a movie wouldn't have been released by Disney if there weren't any comic stuff inserted. This time, the mood enhancers are the three gargoyles who accompany Quasimodo in his bell-tower. They mostly succeed in their laugh delivering mission, but they often say ridiculous lines, such as ""You're human, with the flesh, and the hair, and the navel lint."" and act in ridiculous situations, such as a poker game which is an excuse for a freewheeling love song.

Talking about the songs, they're not astonishing. They're often located in the wrong moments and the soundtrack won't get any Billboard hit. It's a serious downfall after the success of songs belonging to previous movies. In ""Little Mermaid"", there's ""Under the Sea"". In ""Beauty and the Beast"", there's ""Be my Guest"". In ""Aladdin"", there's ""A Whole New World"". In ""The Lion King"", there are ""Circle of Life"" and ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" (thanks Elton). In ""Pocahontas"", there's ""Colours of the Winds"". In ""The Hunchback"", there is... That's the point: there's nothing.

Animation is good, but not everywhere. The city of Paris lacks of a magic touch, but Notre Dame is superb. The basilica is drawn on a monumental scale and becomes a divine entity, with the help of some quotes, particularly from Phoebus' part. The Gothic architecture and the windows are a feast for the eyes. Fire effects are also remarkable.

""The Hunchback of the Notre Dame"" is not a disaster, but it's a sign that Disney has jumped the shark. That's what happens when you run out of fairy tales or children's books in order to get a storyline. But the message is here and children should have lessons to learn here."
Eraser (1996),"True Lies is often considered to be the last good/great Arnold Schwarzenegger action film. That is because Eraser it seems (at least to me before actually viewing the film), just did not see the amount of success that Arnold's previous action films achieved. Eraser was released in 1996 and had a troubled production where, if it was not for Schwarzenegger, this film would not have been released. The film was directed by Chuck Russell (The Mask, A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors, The Scorpion King) and stars (obviously) Arnold Schwarzenegger (The Terminator, Total Recall, and Terminator 2: Judgment Day). The film was a box office hit but was not as well received as Arnold's previous films. But that is not to say that this film has it's fans as I have seen a following for this film.

John Kruger is a US Marshall and works as a person who helps protect witnesses. One particular assignment sees Kruger protecting a woman who has information on a company who are developing high tech weapons that are being sold to the wrong people. It is up to Kruger not only to protect the witness, but to make sure these weapons do not get into the wrong hands.

Let's be real here, Eraser is nowhere close to being Arnold's best. Yet, it is far from being his worst. Eraser, for me, was better than I was expecting for the most part. It reminds me of a Dolph Lundgren film released in 2001 called Hidden Agenda. Just imagine this film, hardly any action and fun, and no high tech weaponry. I was surprised that this film was pretty high tech with the whole ""rail gun"" being the main focus. I find it too high tech because if you take it out of the film, the film itself is pretty realistic (for an action movie at least). This high tech weapon takes out any sense of realism. Yet, the weapon itself is pretty unique. The weapon has it's own logical issues, but that is action movie logic for you (and don't take that as me defending it). The special effects are, let's say dated. Completely CG and not always convincing. Mostly used with the firing of the ""rail gun weapon and a few of the bigger action scenes. Otherwise, I do not have a huge problem with it but considering that this is a point in film history that CG is being used and used fairly well, I would expect a little more from this film. Speaking of the action, the action here is fairly good. There are some scenes here that are just plain fun, something that should be present in any good Schwarzenegger action film. We get maybe one big action scene and the rest are fun little action scenes mostly consisting of shootouts and an explosion here and there. Aside from the action, the film has some good comedic moments and we get the usual Arnold one liners. Though when none of that is present on screen, the film feels pretty generic and that is the overall feel for this film. Arnold is still on his up and up in his role of John Kruger. Arnold does give us a good performance and plays the protector character fairly well. You feel safe when around this character. Vanessa Williams plays the woman being protected and she does fine as well and plays a female character capable of holding her own. The story overall takes a little bit to get interesting and when a nice twist is revealed, the film gets a little bit interesting. Again, the film does not do much by itself to be entirely interesting without the help of action and comedy. I should note that this film's cinematographer, did cinematography for Terminator 2: Judgment Day and it is very apparent and looks amazing here with the lighting and the ability to give us viewers a good view of the action taking place. Lastly, Alan Silvestri does a good job with the music here. It is nice to hear it in the background while the action is taking place.

Eraser, overall, is just an OK film, despite my apparent overwhelming praise. It does not surpass some of Arnold's finest but it is still worth a watch as it does have it's moments."
For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943),"I've not read the Hemingway novel on which this film is based, nor will I spend any time summarizing the plot, as others here have already done a fine job of that. Let me just add my voice to those who have praised this film as a very good romantic adventure of its time. It of course has one foot obviously placed squarely in WWII propaganda (Gary Cooper as the iconic romantic American hero), but it's also highly entertaining.

It's longer than it needs to be, and it's a bit talky, but it nevertheless doesn't drag. The highest praise must go to the art directors, who fashion an impressive set perched among some rocky mountains that feels extremely authentic. The color photography isn't as vibrant as other Technicolor products of the time, but that may be due to age. And there's a terrific lush score to go along with the action.

I've never been a huge fan of Ingrid Bergman, but she's not bad here. Gary Cooper is perfectly cast and is required to do little more than just be Gary Cooper, but it works. The most colorful performances come from Akim Tamiroff and, especially, Katina Paxinou as two members of the Spanish revolutionary group. Paxinou is a firecracker, giving an intense performance that dominates the screen whenever she's present.

A highly enjoyable Hollywood product from the war years.

Grade: A-"
Rear Window (1954),"This movie was a very influential piece by a very influential man. They tell me this flick changed the way some things were done in the movie business. I am told by others that this one is one of the truly best of Hitchcock's, well worth checking out. I, nevertheless walked into this movie with an open mind. A mind that quickly got bored.

I did like the caught-up-in-the-mystery feeling that flashed through a few scenes. I did like the famous drawl of James Stewart, and his character's wit throughout. And I am now interested in reading some of Cornel Woolrich's short stories, from which this screenplay was created. But still, I was bored.

Leaving behind the ""importance"" of this movie and only commenting on how it affected me, I only give it a four out of ten. On my personal rating scale that's counted as ""not great, not horrible, don't bother."" See it if you must. It is, after all, one of the talked about films in certain circles. If you have not seen it and end up in one of those circles, rest assured that the person extolling it's genius is most likely paraphrasing a magazine article he or she read last night and is not too sure what they are supposed to think about this one."
Meet Me in St. Louis (1944),"This is Judy Garlands second best film, next to the Wizard of Oz. It has the nostalgic feeling of fantasy for a different time & place. Feeling good & no place like home come into play too.

Vincent Minelli directs this Garland starring vehicle & then marries her after the film. Arther Freed, the MGM musical genius produces it. The supporting cast is strong from character actors Marjorie Main & Chill Wills, to Mary Astor & even a 19 year old June Lockhart.

The story is basically about St. Louis & a family living there in 1903. During the first half hour Judy sings several songs. Then there is a musical break for a while before the songs come back as we go from summer to fall. Then in the winter in the last 15 minutes, Judy finally gets to that tune ""Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas."" Besides Over The Rainbow, this is her next most famous song.

This Technicolor musical is a good film. Some of the tunes are now dated, but Judys Christmas song is as timeless as any she ever sang & she is in excellent voice. The film features the mandatory happy ending which most films of the period have.

It runs a little short of 2 hours so it doesn't get bogged down which makes it quite watchable & even though it has Christmas in it, it is not broadcast as often as other Christmas films, but is as good as many of the films which are broadcast every year."
Spellbound (1945),"Seriously Spellbound was one the most unusual picture from Hitch, despite it was one of his favorite one, the picture is a thematic production, first to approach this forgotten matter as never seem before, it's probable is the upmost relevance, due during the war 20% of the soldiers were affected by nervous collapse.

The scrip has a nerve to expose and also dive in the labyrinth of sick mind to recover what event triggered de breakdown, however the implausible plot somewhat ruins what might be a powerful feature, just a shaper look will recognize such flaw, further it's unthinkable a man mentally disable replaces a notorious psychiatrist in the clinic, it was no place whatsoever, also when Dr. Constance (Bergman) got cure Ballantyne (Gregory Peck) in a couple months is a blatant fails, this intricate case would take so long on regular psychoanalysis, sometimes years.

David O. Selznick and Hitchcock invited the surrealist painting Salvador Dali aiming to increase the movie reputation on dream's sequence, however Dali made a so gloomy and overlong sequence that Selznick had intervene to cut halfway through, it clearly disappointed Dali, nonetheless accepts the middle ground, visually Hitchcock made ones finest picture mixing many elements as the all door open early sequence that suggestion going to the mind, another highlight was when Peck drinks the cup of milk, what a creative scene, sadly something is missing in the picture, it doesn't enthuse me as other Hitch's pictures.

Thanks for reading.

Father of the Bride (1950),"Directed by Vincente Minnelli. Spencer Tracy, Joan Bennett, Elizabeth Taylor, Leo G. Carroll, Don Taylor, Melville Cooper, Billie Burke, Moroni Olsen, Russ Tamblyn, Paul Harvey, Marietta Canty.

Pity poor Tracy: he suffers endless exasperation while preparing for his only daughter's wedding to a nice young man with a nice job and a nice family. What misfortune! Barely qualifies as a comedy of errors, since it focuses primarily on Tracy's upper middle class woes and whining (why won't anyone drink one of his martinis?). Maybe he was supposed to be a self-absorbed, semi-neurotic schmuck the audience can laugh at, but Minnelli doesn't pitch it in that direction, and Tracy certainly doesn't play it that way. Tracy bumbles through his frustrations, managing the occasional amusing quip or weary observation, but too often maintains his identifiably steadfast dignity to really be funny; the script navigates low-energy sitcom-level mishaps, but does manage a few humorous but predictable punchlines--you think that coat of his is going to rip? Bennett is the reasonable, supportive mother of the bride; Liz Taylor the soft and spoiled bride-to-be. Runs just over an hour-and-a-half but feels much longer.

48/100"
Laura (1944),"A superbly stylish movie. None of its characters is without flaws - even the elusive Laura is too naive for her own good. They are presented lovingly by Preminger, and his award-winning DOP Joseph LaShelle.

The excellent script ranges from caustic Laedecker/Webb put-downs, through brutal Treadwell/Anderson self-assessment, to laconic MacPherson/Andrews minimalism.

The score is, of course, a classic. Raksin's sinuous melody, brilliantly deployed, haunts the picture as powerfully as Laura's portrait haunts Detective MacPherson.

The central performances are wonderful, not least because of the perfect casting. Tierney shines as the enigmatic title character: beautiful, intelligent, somehow both cool and passionate at the same time. Webb dazzles, Price slithers, Anderson simmers. Best of all is Andrews as the detective who barely opens his mouth when he speaks, and on whose face desire barely flickers - but he does enough to show you exactly what he wants and how he feels. It's a great movie performance from an underrated actor. Only Dorothy Adams doesn't quite fit, in a role - Laura's maid - that could easily have been as showy as the others with the right performer.

LAURA doesn't appear to be about anything significant, but it leaves behind it a feeling that it is greater than the sum of its parts. I don't know how this was managed, and perhaps no-one involved in it did either. It's one of those movies where everything just clicked. Seeing it again recently, after many years, confirms its status for me as a significant work, but exactly why or how remains as much of a puzzle as Laura herself."
Lost Horizon (1937),"What a masterful film, filled with adventure, memorable characters, and a story that is profoundly thoughtful. During a tumultuous revolt in China, a party of Westerners, including an important British diplomat named Robert Conway (Ronald Colman), escapes by airplane, flying west through the high mountains of Asia. In this no-mans land, disaster strikes. But beyond, a peaceful kingdom called Shangri-la awaits the party, led by their guide, the wise and purposeful Chang (Oscar-nominated H.B. Warner). Much of the plot takes place in this beautiful and serene place.

In Shangri-la, doctors are not needed, there is no crime, residents are content and happy. And people age very slowly, as a result of ""the absence of struggle"". Despite the forbidding mountains and their harsh weather that surround Shangri-la, this isolated paradise contains lush vegetation, useful minerals, a picturesque waterfall, birds and other wildlife.

Most characters are appealing. I like the wise and patient Mr. Chang. The High Lama (Sam Jaffe) exudes peace and wisdom. The George character is annoying, but serves a purpose as the representative of conventional humanity. There are many lines of thoughtful dialogue. One of my favorites is a quote from Chang who talks to Conway about aging. Says Chang in a non-judgmental and soft voice: ""You know, each time you Westerners celebrate your birthdays, you build another fence around your minds"".

B&W visuals are grainy. Lighting ranges from evocative to bad. In the outdoor adventure scenes, there are lots of interesting long shots. Sets make use of painted backdrops and miniatures. And the special effects are terrific for the era. Background music is intermittent and ranges from nondescript in early segments to ethereal in Shangra-la. Acting is adequate.

Though the film tells a great outdoor adventure story, the real value of ""Lost Horizon"" lies in its deep spiritual themes, as expressed by Chang and the High Lama. Rarely does a film exude such wisdom. And it is mostly for this reason that, despite imperfect visuals, the film ranks among my all-time favorites."
My Man Godfrey (1936),"Of course the deck is slightly stacked in this story of a bum unexpectedly entering a ""stinking rich"" family. It is fairly rapidly revealed that the bum was not really one, that he comes from mostly the same old money background as the family itself, and that this accounts for his immediate ability to find his way around with the Bullocks, he has got at his disposal all the required codes and keys enabling him to wrap them all around his finger. Beyond its well-meaning fairy tale conclusion - the poor being given a job and getting richer or at least a less precarious life, while the spoiled rich will not have to endure poverty, though they might have rather deserved it through their brainlessness - the film is not deep down a socially-conscious comedy, such as some of Capra's most well-known pictures or Sullivan's Travels from Preston Sturges. It is rather the epitome of the screwball genre. Which means that, though it does incorporate a fair amount of nuttiness occasionally verging on the absurd, it also relies first and mainly on a rigorous system of cogs and wheels well-controlled by the screenwriters and the director. The disguise motive has provided some of the best comedies on stage, such as Shakespeare's Twelfth Night or the very subtle comedies from XVIIIth century French playwright Marivaux, so it is not surprising that it soon became a feature of some of the best comedies on screen as well. Here there is a double level of travesty : the butler is a former bum, but actually the bum was himself a former millionaire, so it actually works on three levels. And as often in such stories the comical effect is based on an inversion of normal relations, Godfrey the servant becoming in some way the master of the clueless Bullock family. There are much darker variations on a similar theme, such as The Servant by Joseph Losey or earlier on Miss Julie by Ibsen. Nothing remotely as dark as that here. Godfrey is a broadly benevolent and selfless influence, though his relations with Irene prove that he has no real idea on how to manage the various unexpected effects of his irruption in the dysfunctional Bullock household. He will not find the solution himself - Irene eventually will, which is a brilliant last twist of the story, the wise master has found his own master in the seemingly brainless young woman. Great conclusion. Does one really have to add that William Powell and Carole Lombard are shining bright and the rest of the cast is outstanding? Probably not."
Giant (1956),"This has recently played on Turner Classic Movies, and so they have been playing a short promo on the film. However, I disagree with the critics' assessment that this is a man versus woman film. Instead, this is a film about the pangs of old Texas giving birth to new Texas. Rock Hudson plays the young patriarch of a Texas ranching family, Bick Benedict, in the 1920s who goes to Maryland to buy a colt. He is instantly smitten with one of the daughters in the family (Elizabeth Taylor as Leslie) , in spite of the fact that she raises his Texas ire by saying things such as Texas was stolen from Mexico! Taylor's character is already spoken for, but she throws over her intended and she and Benedict marry on a whim.

Adjustment is hard for Leslie. The Benedict ranch is sprawling but devoid of Maryland's natural beauty. Bick's sister Luz runs the house and is not going to give that title up to some delicate East coast beauty. And when she tries to help the Mexican families that live on the ranch, she finds her husband angry with her. Ranch hand Jett Rink (James Dean in his last film role) falls madly in love with Leslie who just doesn't see it. Meanwhile Luz has always loved Jett, and that love later greatly complicates the Benedicts' lives in a very unconventional way.

Like I said, this is no man versus woman film. This is initially east coast liberal civilized values versus the rough and tumble values of what is still the Texas frontier in many ways. And it is the story of a family over 30 years as Texas changes in its values and what is important in its industry. For example, cattle ranching gives way in importance to the petroleum industry. As for changing values, Bick changes from a man who really doesn't see the Hispanics as human beings to somebody who literally takes a beating to defend the honor of one decades later.

Highly recommended as a film and as a showcase for the talents of Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor, and James Dean. Dean had other good showcases for his talent, but I feel Hudson and Taylor - in spite of her two Best Actress Oscars are both remembered too much for their soapy roles and not enough for their acting skills. Highly recommended."
"39 Steps, The (1935)","This is proof - if ever it were really needed - that age doesn't really affect a film's quality. If anyone needs to see some of Hitchcock's finest moments, this should be among them.

Playing fast and loose somewhat with John Buchan's (1916) novel, Hitchcock nevertheless directs a fast-moving, riveting story of political intrigue and paranoia with some truly hair-raising scenes (the Forth rail bridge scene springs to mind).

Hitchcock makes his usual cameo appearances. Apart from the one noted here, he's also in one of the early scenes after Arabella Smith fires the pistol. The music hall audience panics and make for the egress, 'Hitch' being one of the crowd. He's also one of the detectives seeking Hannay after he leaves the train on the Forth bridge.

There are some really sparkling lines of dialogue: cold, hungry and tired after tramping across the moors in (what I suppose is Fife), Hannay encounters a crofter (played by John Laurie, later famous as Fraser in Dad's Army): Crofter (to Hannay who has asked him for a bed for the night): Can you sleep in a box bed?"" Hannay: ""I can try"" Crofter: ""Can you eat the herring?"" Hannay: ""I could eat half a dozen right now"".

Once inside, the crofter's (much younger) wife asks Hannay the following, after hearing that he lives in London: ""Is it true that the women in London are beautiful?"" Hannay: ""Some of them are but they wouldn't be if they stood next to you."" My word, what a charmer!

In case you were wondering, the thirty-nine steps in the original book referred to the steps down to the sea at a secluded bay, the spy involved arranging to be extracted by a submarine when the tide had covered up to the thirty-ninth step from the top. This is not alluded to in the 1935 film version, other than to give a name to the network of spies involved. Hannay was a mining engineer and Arabella Smith in the book is a man! It's a short-ish film too, coming in at about an hour and a quarter. It's occasionally on British terrestrial telly and never fails to please. Why they tried to remake this (in 1953 and 1978) is anyone's guess as you can't improve on perfection."
Night of the Living Dead (1968),"Romero's gruesome first film, combining gore, 'bona fide' frights horror and in documentary style with skillful characterization, it's one of the most successful independent films of all time. A mysterious plague caused by a satellite that expands a high level of radiation, it creates the recently dead to rise from their graves and scout the countryside and surrounding a farmhouse for feed on and where find shelter a hapless group. The legions of dead people who stalk the house are looking exasperatingly for live humans .

The first time the Zombies appeared was in ¨White Zombie(1932)¨. From then on Zombies remained a firm staple of terror B-genre , bringing the dead back to life was a popular pastime in the 30s and 40s. The early zombies were basically genteel beings and generally likable and agreeable types. Romero created in Pittsburg his own production company Image Ten Productions with his friends, John Russo among them and they each contributed 10.000 dollars and formed the budget for his first movie which made Romero world famous. George A. Romero cast an African-American Duane Jones, unusual by the time.When Romero directed this claustrophobic picture , he gave birth to the modern Zombie genre and the film has had a lasting importance, giving interesting consideration to the violence executed by the zombies. It was initially dismissed as exploitation, but when was re-released , it struck deeply with a disillusioned youth angry with the desperation about Vietnam. It was one of the first successful independent terror productions influencing and inspiring countless imitations, copies and rip-offs. Followed by three equally cellebrated sequels, ¨Dawn of the dead(78)¨where the zombies attack a shopping mall ,¨Day of the dead dead(85)¨ about flesh-eating zombies taking over the world and scientific experimenting on zombies and ¨Land of dead(2005)¨ with high budget played by Simon Baker,Asia Argento and Dennis Hooper. And also an inferior remake in 1990 by Tom Savini with Tone Todd(Duane Jones's role) in which again a bunch of people are pursued by ghouls Zombies ."
Picnic (1955),"A macho drifter (William Holden) sidles into a small town in Nowheresville, U.S.A. and the local womenfolk, who all apparently think that their menfolk aren't up to snuff, drool all over him like he's a stripper at a bachelorette party. Not much else happens in this wanna-be sultry film based on the William Inge play.

The 1950s were a big decade for big movies based on big plays. Unfortunately, every film maker was under so much pressure to tone down whatever it was that made the play big in the first place, that the movies based on them seem all too often like a big to-do over mighty little. ""Picnic"" is nearly plot less; the only suspense comes in wondering if Kim Novak is going to ditch her dull home town and take off with her hunk of man.

Holden was a good actor, but he gives a silly performance here. The script and the direction push too hard the fact that we're supposed to be overwhelmed by his virility---which is a shame, because that was one of Holden's most striking attributes when he was allowed to act more naturally. His furry chest was up there with some of the most famous chests in screen history, yet they had him shave it for this film so that he would look younger. He instead resorts to ripping off his shirt every so often like the Scottish janitor from the Simpsons.

Kim Novak, on the other hand, was never really a good actress, and this movie didn't change my mind. Talk about famous chests---holy cow, she could poke eyes out with those things! The BIG moment between her and Holden comes when they dance at a town social, if dance is quite the right word. If you've seen Elaine on ""Seinfeld"" dance, you will have a pretty good indication of what these two look like.

The best performance in the film comes from Rosalind Russell, who plays the sexually frustrated town shrew, married to the town drunk (Arthur O'Connell). She's able to convey the desperation felt by a woman slowly wasting away in a forgotten corner of the American heartland and illustrates exactly what Novak's character is afraid of becoming.

I know I'm being pretty hard on this movie, but actually I did enjoy it. It's really nothing special, so don't go out of your way to see it, but it is fun to make fun of all the cornball 50s trappings.

Grade: B-"
"Chamber, The (1996)","I would say this one was just run of the mill as far as the overall picture. Gene Hackman, a staple of Grisham movies, is very good and most likely the saving grace. He plays a white supremacist bomber who is set to be executed because he supposedly blew up a one-armed Jewish lawyer and his two twin girls. Chris O'Donnell is Hackman's grandson who becomes his lawyer in an desperate attempt to save his life. I would say that O'Donnell's acting is adequate but not exceptional. Fay Dunaway plays Hackman's aged daughter and turns in a fine showing. The plot is well constructed but it leaves you wondering was justice really done? I feel the answer is the all too usual yes and no. On one hand the guilty were punished and yet no one is satisfied with the outcome which I suppose is true of most real life situations. Hackman's character is as bad as an apple that's been lying on the ground for three weeks but he at times does resemble an actual human being with real feelings and emotions. His character isn't sorry about anything he's done but is his own man. He assumes responsibility for his sins while detesting those who used him for their own ends and it shows when he angrily confronts his old comrade-in-arms who pays him a stupidly ill-advised visit in prison. O'Donnell's character does love Hackman in spite of Hackman's repeated abuse of him and tries everything possible to defend him from final judgment. I can't say I loved this film it was not a wasted experience just not a pleasant one due to the subject material but you can't be happy everyday."
Angels in the Outfield (1994),"This is one of the movies I watched as a kid. Interestingly, during this era the film was made there were a lot of movies which came out with this kind of theme, of a losing team where someone or something helps that team become a winning team. The most memorable film of that category is probably ""Space Jam"" which came out a couple of years later, and I heard it is still the highest grossing basketball movie.

This movie is probably the first movie we are familiar with that the famous actor Joseph Gordon Levitt. He has come a long way since then, and has become like every girls dream. I wonder what happened to the other kid, J.P.? I haven't heard any clear answers. Joseph Gordon Levitt would much later star in a movie with Tony Danza, they even talked a little about this movie in their interviews, but I wish he'd talk more about what it was like working in this movie.

I recently saw this movie on my parents old VHS tape, and while I remember it pretty well since I was a kid, it mostly just seemed like a cheesy movie and a waste of time. Some of the movie seems serious, I mean it's a movie that involves foster kids, and some of the scenes that don't involve baseball or angels are a little serious. But, the movie seems incredibly cheesy and too focused on an individual character. I mean the movie involves a losing baseball team with a manager George Knox played by Danny Glover who can't take always being on a losing team. Then, we have a couple of boys Roger and J.P. who are in a foster home. As we'd see from the trailer, Roger asks his Dad, ""When Are We Going To Be A Family Again."" The father replies, ""The Way I See It, I'd Say When The Angels Win The Pennant."" Now looking at that movie from an adult perspective, it sounds like a sarcastic remark, like why would you believe it? But, Roger takes his fathers words literally and prays for the California Angels in a somewhat funny prayer. The Angels start to help out the California Angels, and that is the main plot of the movie, which is obviously the title.

Let me tell you, while this movie might have wanted to leave a good message of believing in God and miracles, it doesn't do it in a religious way. I mean the angels are lead by Al the boss angel played by Christopher Lloyd. We only see the angels at the ball park, except in one scene. Every scene the angels are in, are cheesy scenes and they do not seem like they are holy, they mostly seem there for comic relief for a film with a somewhat serious tone in some scenes. I mean, it's interesting to think that angels would help a losing team become a winning team with the most bizarre methods. But, the angels weren't in the more serious scenes where what Roger really wanted was his father back. Also, how a prayer would be answered about a losing baseball team becoming a winning baseball team, but not about all the other problems in the world, almost making Roger's problems seem like they're at the center of the universe.

I give this movie credit, it still is somewhat inspirational. But, I wouldn't say the movie is too exciting or too fast paced. I'd say it is mostly just a cheesy movie about angels helping a baseball team win so a boy could get his father back, and again the angels weren't holy.

This movie's message, isn't as inspirational as a more recent movie about the surfer, Bethany Hamilton, ""Soul Surfer."" That movie was truly inspirational, and not in a cheesy way. It also isn't as inspirational as a recent religious movie about a boy who sees heaven, ""Heaven Is For Real."" So, I'm sure everybody who sees this ""Angels In The Outfield,"" could agree that the angels didn't seem holy, and were mostly cheesy. I don't really remember laughing at this movie except in a couple of scenes.

What else I want to say, is I've recently seen another kids movie of a losing team becoming a winning team called ""Underdog Kids."" While that movie was pretty cheesy, I actually enjoyed it somewhat, because I felt like that movie left some really good messages, and probably better messages than ""Angels In The Outfield"" when ""Underdog Kids"" doesn't talk about angels. So, I'd recommend that movie.

Also, the funniest book I've read IN MY ENTIRE LIFE is a book around the same age as ""Angels In The Outfield"" called ""The Toilet Paper Tigers,"" a 1993 book by Gordon Korman. The book is about a low budget little league team of misfits, and a coach who doesn't know how to coach baseball. But, the coach's niece the same age as the boys finds ways to annoy the boys into making them become a winning team. Some of the boys secretly like her. That book would seem to make a better movie than ""Angels In The Outfield,"" of course if it had the right director. It seems like a better story and more exciting. I'd definitely recommend that book.

""Angels In The Outfield,"" entertains me somewhat, but I wouldn't recommend it. I feel like this movie has too much emphasis on angels helping a losing team in cheesy ways, and a boy in a foster home in mostly ways that aren't inspiring, losing the movie's entertaining factor. Watch another Disney movie the same age as this instead, ""Blank Check."" I feel like that one is way more entertaining. I give Angels In The Outfield A 6 for some entertainment, and a movie I enjoyed when I was a kid."
"Sword in the Stone, The (1963)","The Sword in the Stone is one of the scratchiest Disney movies. At the time they were still experimenting with and getting to know the Xerox system, allowing them to produce animation with a smaller budget, but with a noticeably rougher outlines and simpler character models. And it shows. The Sword in the Stone is one of the worst looking Disney films, there's really no way around it. But, it makes up for that, at least partially, with some catchy tunes from the Sherman Brothers, and with fun, memorable characters.

The story is basically that from T. H. Stone's novel of the same name. Merlin is a wizard who ages backwards in time - it's complicated - and he's the one who mentors Arthur Pendragon in his early days as a page in a distant, rural castle in the English countryside. That mentoring mostly consisting of him changing Arthur into various animals and watching as he almost gets eaten. Happy fun times for the whole family.

In all seriousness though, Merlin is a great character. Good lines, classic character design, the best song in the whole film and his various hijinks with Arthur's life do keep us entertained throughout the whole film.

What keeps this from being a greater Disney film is that the story itself doesn't really contain all that much and that the side characters are not that interesting. In the book we have knights, creatures of the forest, Robin Hood of all things, villagers, castle folk. None of which we see in this film. It's just Merlin, non-speaking animals and Arthur most of the time. It's kind of fun, but the book had potential for so much more. Imagine if they did King Arthur during the 90s, in the middle of Disney Renaissance. That would have been amazing. Just think about it.

In the end The Sword in the Stone is a perfectly good children's film with a more relaxed tone than was typical for a Disney film at the time. It's not bad, but it's unfortunately not great either."
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991),"I remember when ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES came out, I had extremely high hopes for it. The promotional stills and interviews looked promising, and I was expecting a high-spirited romp on par with Errol Flynn's celebrated film. Boy, was I in for a letdown.

The movie starts off thrillingly, with Michael Kamen's spectacular score playing over medieval illustrations. But as soon as the opening credits end, the film shows its true colorsa dark, dank, gore-laden bore. Seriously, what Robin Hood movie worth its salt starts with a dismemberment scene? I couldn't even look at the screen for this sequence. Alas, it was only the beginning. We're later treated to a close-up of Robin slitting his hand open (and blood seeping thru his fingers) to swear revenge for his father, we see Will Scarlett take an arrow thru the hand, we see the Sheriff of Nottingham's witch slice her arm open and spit into her blood to make a prediction, we see a blood-filled egg cracked open in another scene, we see the Sheriff's face getting stitched upreally, how's a guy supposed to keep his popcorn down? How did this movie get away with a PG-13 rating? This is R-level stuff all the way. Of course, the movie's lack of color and light doesn't help much. I don't mind them foregoing the tights for this go-round, but why isn't Robin Hood wearing his signature Lincoln green? Why isn't Will Scarlett at least wearing SOMETHING red? Everybody's wearing browns and blacks, which makes the film monochromatic and dull. Sherwood Forest looks dirty and gloomy instead of inviting and exciting. The sets are so dark and shadowy that it's a miracle anyone can see where they're going. I'm sure John Graysmark and John Bloomfield did their best with the sets and costumes, but they would have been better served had they been colorful and well-lit. And the plot takes too much of the spirit out of the legend. Robin's such a sullen gloomy Gus that it's impossible to imagine the Merry Men taking him in, much less letting him lead them. Friar Tuck's reduced to a potbellied wimp (what happened to the swordsman who was more lethal than he looked?). Azeem, while a good character in his own right, really doesn't belong in the Robin Hood mythos. (He would have made a fine stand-alone character, though.) The witch has no business being in this film at all. And what purpose does it serve to make Will Scarlett Robin's traitorous half-brother? Director Kevin Reynolds tries to guide the movie with a swift and steady hand, but the film is such a dismal mess that he ultimately can't hold it together. It's so ponderous and serious that there's no sense of fun to be had. And hearing Kamen's glorious score accompanying the film makes the experience even worse. That music deserved to be in a much better movie, and it possesses the fun, exciting spirit that the movie itself utterly lacks.

And then there's the acting. You couldn't find a better Sheriff of Nottingham than Alan Rickman, and he literally steals the show. But that's not too hard when everyone else stinks. Morgan Freeman does his best with Azeem, but again, this character doesn't belong in the saga. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio doesn't have any spark as Marian, nor is she really beautiful enough to play the part (Olivia DeHavilland she ain't). Christian Slater can't make heads or tails of the tarnished Will. Brian Blessed is wasted as Robin's doomed dad, as is Michael Wincott as Guy of Gisbourne. Sean Connery's cameo as King Richard is fun, but pointless. The supporting players are so dull they aren't even worth mentioning. And Kevin Costnergreat actor, but a LOUSY Robin Hood. He has neither the presence or the attitude this character requires, and he's always talking in a droning monotone. In no way does he come off as an inspiring leader; he's more apt to put you to sleep. Nor does he have the physicality the role demands. I haven't seen a Robin Hood this inept since Barrie Ingham in A CHALLENGE FOR ROBIN HOOD. Yeah, Costner gets in a few good shots with an arrow, but when Robin thoroughly sucks at swordplay and can't even take the Sheriff without help from Azeem, you know the filmmakers have screwed up. Robin Hood's supposed to be the last dude on the planet you want to mess with, not a graceless klutz. Errol Flynn would have trashed the Sheriff and his witch with both hands tied behind his back. Heck, even Cary Elwes' MEN IN TIGHTS incarnation and Disney's cartoon fox Robin would have made short work of them. This Robinwell, had he been killed at the end of the movie, I doubt anyone would have really cared. He's hardly the sort of guy you want to root for.

Call me old-fashioned, but I don't like my swashbuckler epics to be gory, dark, and dismal exercises in tedium. I like them bright, colorful, exuberant, and funwith a minimum of bloodletting. THE MASK OF ZORRO is a case in point, as are THE PRINCESS BRIDE, LORD OF THE RINGS and PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN. Compared to those films, PRINCE OF THIEVES falls horribly short. Compared to the Errol Flynn classic it so wants to topple, it's an even bigger failure. Maybe some day there'll be a good, modern Robin Hood movie that measures up to the Flynn version and truly revives the legend for a new generation. But for now, this film ain't it. Stick with the Flynn version."
Sleepers (1996),"The first half of Sleepers is gut-wrenching, disturbing, and brilliantly acted by the young stars. Watching their mistake and the exorbitant price they pay for it, you feel their guilt and their subsequent victimization to the point of physical discomfort. You can't wait for the second act when the villains will be brought to justice and you'll feel just great about the whole thing. . .right?

Then you get the second act. It turns into a showcase for hot young over-actors who could learn a thing or two from their younger counterparts. DeNiro's character is the most compelling and the movie would have done better to involve him more, but because of the cursory examinations Ron Eldard and Billy Crudup (and the screenplay) provide their characters, you never fully believe DeNiro would do what he does. Brad Pitt and Dustin Hoffman try like heck to make their plotline ring true, while Jason Patric and Minnie Driver just sit there and whine as if the story itself provides the tension they lack.

Plotwise, the second half provides only one real moment wherein the wounds begin to heal, with the testimony of one of the villains. The rest of the act, the movie and Hoffman double plead their own case. They're innocent, but if they're guilty it's still OK. The nonsensical mafia subplot seems a weak device to tie up loose ends, and where does DeNiro come up with his ace in the hole anyway? Sloppy writing that leaves the viewer still licking the wounds of the first half."
Victor/Victoria (1982),"1982 was a gender-bending year for Hollywood. Dustin Hoffman dressed up as a woman; Julie Andrews dressed up as a man. How fitting that the very next year Linda Hunt would win the first Oscar ever given for playing a member of the opposite sex.

""Victor Victoria"" is a solidly-crafted, old-fashioned musical that finds Andrews pretending to be a male female impersonator (got that?) so that she can hold a job in a nightclub in Depression-era Paris. James Garner is the man's man who begins to doubt his manliness when he finds himself having some strange feelings for this ""guy."" It's a very gay-friendly movie that's really squeaky clean, though it might have been racy at the time when homosexuality wasn't as accepted as it is now (if you want to call it ""accepted"" even now).

There are lots of production numbers, but this doesn't feel like a musical, as all of the numbers are presented in context of a show and they don't propel the plot or develop characters. Lesley Ann Warren is fairly obnoxious as a bawdy American, but Robert Preston steals the show as a fellow drag performer.

As far as Blake Edwards projects go, this is one of the strongest.

Grade: B+"
"Great Race, The (1965)","I'm giving this film extra points because I have such fond memories of it; but the reader should be aware that this is over-rating it as a film.

The bad news: it is way overlong; Edwards always was a terribly self-indulgent parodist, even on the Peter Gunn show; the big pie fight is excruciatingly mishandled; Curtis and Lemmon were told to ham it up and they do, and this gets painful sometimes; the story is silly and the finale unsatisfying.

The good news: Natalie Wood is beautiful and unforgettable and does marvelous. The camera work makes the sound-stage ""exteriors"" come alive, without ever hiding the fact that they are in a sound-stage (they're intended to look phony). The story does have an oddly epic feel to it which is why it remains watchable despite its length and occasionally unfunny sequences.

The film is of course really of the 1960s genre ""camp"". Nobody's ever adequately explained the appearance of this genre; the silent films Blake is spoofing here were brilliantly spoofed in their own day by much brighter comic minds like Keaton and Chaplin, so it's not clear why anybody in the '60s thought they needed to be spoofed again. After all, ""The Perils of Pauline"" is from the same era that gave us Von Stroheim's brutally realistic ""Greed""; did movie-makers of the '60s really think they were so much more ""mature"" and ""sophisticated"" than Eric Von Stroheim? If not, then why pretend that the silent film era was somehow an age of ""innocence"" that we had ""gone beyond""? '60s camp is, in the last analysis, a collective monument to generational arrogance, nothing more; but I suppose, since this arrogance is a recurring problem in Modern culture, we need reminders that one generation's arrogance is another's fodder for parody."
"Crying Game, The (1992)","I hadn't seen this film but had heard good things about it and knew the 'twist'. It was shown on Film4's 'Films for Life' season in April 2011 so finally decided to watch it and was astounded by how bad it was. I'm bemused by all the comments here about the good script, good acting, etc because I experienced the exact opposite. The acting was appalling, especially Forest Whitaker and Jaye Davidson; Whitaker's English accent made Dick Van Dyke's Mary Poppins accent look good. It was all over the place, varying from Cockney to Australian to Texan American in one sentence. He was obviously concentrating on the accent as his acting was very hammy. Davidson was perhaps the most wooden and un-natural actor I've ever seen on screen - his happy, sad, drunk, murderous and suicidal were all delivered with the same emotionless deadpan monotone. The dialogue was stilted and full of cliché after cliché. The plot was unreal and relied on suspension of disbelief - apparently English people cannot distinguish between a thick Belfast accent and a Scottish one (wait a minute, that's Americans isn't it?); apparently the IRA plot the assassination of politicians off-the-cuff the day before in the back of a car with a 5 minute run-through and then, when it goes wrong, just wing it and deliberately instigate an OK Corral shoot-out....oh my, such a bad film"
Sophie's Choice (1982),"This movie is officially protected from withering criticism by its wisely taking out Streep Insurance (i.e. Arguably the greatest American female actor delivering arguably her greatest performance) and the cinematography from another film genius, Nestor Almendros, is simply stunning (safe to say Brooklyn has never looked lovelier). But one gets the distinct impression, as the film slowly expands to a gaseous two hours and forty minutes, that writer/director Alan J. Pakula, like a chef with a runaway souffle, lets the whole unwieldy film, from William Styron's unwieldy novel, get away from him. This feeling of directorial fumbling is especially strong in the second half, when the thing lurches rather than inexorably moves to what is intended to be a shattering conclusion and what we get instead is a rather hurried, perfunctory scene (ironic for such a long, slow film) featuring moustache twirling Nazi-ism and infant squawling, and the question ""Is that all there is?"" pervades the consciousness as we cut from the Holocaust to the Capitol Hotel in DC and a rather off putting sex scene between Streep and the annoyingly callow Peter MacNicol in what has to be one of cinema's dumber editorial decisions. You really wish someone had been around (producers Martin Starger and Keith Barish perhaps?) to gently remind Pakula, ""We don't give a hush puppy about Stingo. Or his novel. What we care about are Sophie and her surviving kid and why he didn't make it to Brooklyn."" A director in control of his or her material, a director who didn't conceitedly assign the adaptation to himself rather than to a pro like Alvin Sergeant or Jay Presson Allen, would have known how to deal with these rather important matters and how to tell this story effectively and affectingly. B minus.

PS...It took me two days to get Marvin Hamlisch's cloying theme out of my head. This is one better than his equally syrupy theme to ""The Swimmer""."
"Fog, The (1980)","Antonio Bay, California is celebrating its centennial. Father Malone (Hal Holbrook) discovers his grandfather's journal from 1880. It reveals that the six celebrated founders of the town sank a ship called Elizabeth Dane and then stole its gold. The owner Blake had wanted to establish a leper colony. Instead the six used the money to build the town avoid having the leper colony nearby. Strange things are happening in the town. Single mom Stevie Wayne (Adrienne Barbeau) is the radio DJ in the lighthouse. Nick Castle (Tom Atkins) picks up hitchhiker Elizabeth Solley (Jamie Lee Curtis) and then all the windows in his truck shatter. A fog bank comes over a fishing boat and apparitions kill everybody. Nick and Elizabeth sleep together. An apparition comes to kill but the clock strikes 1 am and the witching hour ends. The apparition disappears. Kathy Williams (Janet Leigh) is the organizer of the centennial and she refuses to believe Father Malone and the curse.

This is a rather slow horror and not that scary. It has a spooky quality to it mostly from Carpenter's music and the isolated seaside location. The story is pretty simplistic at its core. It's killer ghosts. The whole exposition with Hal Holbrook reading the diary isn't the most exciting. It's most remembered for Adrienne Barbeau as the sexy DJ. She definitely has the voice for it."
Escape from New York (1981),"In the far-flung future, Manhattan Island is a prison surrounded by a fifty-foot wall. Said prison is guarded from outside the wall, while inside, the prisoners create their own lawless society. When the US President (Donald Pleasence) inadvertently lands in this hell, it's up to bada$$ criminal, Snake Plisskin (Kurt Russell) to retrieve him.

ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK is Director John Carpenter's foray into post-apocalyptic sci-fi / action. In his vision, it's an out of control crime rate, rather than nuclear holocaust that's to blame. Packed with oddball characters, and loaded with classic scenes, EFNY became a trendsetter.

In spite of some clunky, ""futuristic"" technology, and the unavoidable poignancy of having Plisskin land atop the World Trade Center, it all works somehow. For its budget, this movie looks impressive. Russell is perfect in his eye patch-wearing, anti-hero role, riding high before his next big stint in THE THING. Great use is also made of older stars like Lee Van Cleef, Ernest Borgnine, and the inimitable music legend, Isaac Hayes. Carpenter regulars Tom Atkins, Charles Cyphers, and Adrienne Barbeau make appearances, with Ms. Barbeau having some heavenly running sequences! One of the truly great Carpenter films..."
"Howling, The (1981)","Big fan of Gremlins, and always heard tell of how good The Howling was. Problem was I'd never been able to get more than 30 mins into it without something annoying me so badly I had to rage quit. Well, I finally got through it. Right to the end and yeah, it isn't for me.

Not sure what the budget was on this thing, but man oh man does it look bad. Its shot with soft lighting, and not enough lighting, and most of the time looks like Vaseline was on the lens. I think its a technique to mask the low budget special effects. Also, the famous transformation scene which I finally got to goes on for like two minutes too long and isn't that interesting. I prefer the Rat in From Dusk Till Dawn, at least he doesn't mess around. Having recently watched E.T. again I think I've identified my major problem with The Howling. Poor Dee Wallace, who also plays E.T.'s mother, is on screen most of the time, and she's just not a good actress. She's more convincing here than in E.T. but really she just doesn't sell any of it. And that really pulls a picture down when your protagonist, your anchor, just doesn't convince or draw you in. So, yeah. While probably landmark in 1983, The Howling is one I've always struggled to get through, tried to force myself to like, but at the end of the day its a movie its not homework, you don't have to like it. If I had to pinpoint the other main thing that frustrated me about The Howling it would be that the actual werewolves don't do get to do much. They spend so long transforming its like that's all they're good for. Its pretty funny when you think about it. Again, a question of what was possible with the special effects, but earlier films did more. Nosferatu (1922) and Dracula (1931) are incredible to this day. The Howling (1983) is not.

Its funny, maybe the genre just isn't for me. I can't think of a single werewolf movie I've liked except the remake to American Werewolf, and that one probably just hit me because I saw it at the right age, in the cinema. Maybe there's a time for werewolves, and you only get one chance. Its like falling in love."
"Return of Martin Guerre, The  1982)","I've seen the remake of this French drama a couple of times, never knowing it was a remake, so when I learned that The Return of Martin Guerre was the original of Sommersby, I hurried to rent a copy. There were a couple of changes, namely the setting and the ending, and overall I liked the Richard Gere version better, but I'm still glad I saw it.

You've got to hand it to Europeans: they know how to make a period piece. I always say to myself, ""Where did they film this?"" and ""Where did they find these people?"" The crumbling stones from centuries-old buildings, the lighting only created by candles, and the villagers with missing teeth, greasy hair, and grubby faces can only be found in a true European film. The setting of this movie is truly incredible to look at. It's as if the filmmakers snuck a camera into a time machine!

The story itself is interesting. A young couple is married at the start of the movie, and when the husband leaves without any explanation, she's devastated and alone. Ten years later, Gérard Depardieu comes to town, and the villagers rejoice at his return. (In the beginning part of the movie, they managed to find an actor, Stéphane Pean, who looked and sounded like Gérard; pretty cool!) His wife, Nathalie Baye, is overjoyed. But, in the midst of his happy life, a homeless man starts trouble by suggesting that the man who has returned is not who he claims to be. An investigation follows, and the villagers turn on the man they once loved.

If you know Sommersby, you know that this movie is as depressing as it sounds. There's also a very sinister element of the villagers' traditions running around in costume terrorizing their neighbors. It's pretty creepy, and it makes sense why Nathalie didn't like to live alone all those years. If I were you, I'd stick with Richard Gere. It's a lot more romantic, even though it's less of a period piece."
"Tin Drum, The  1979)","I'm reviewing the Criterion DVD restoration of 2013.

I was talking about this film this morning with a friend. It is one of his favorites; he said he could remember even small details like the heart-shaped crack in the wineglass that Oskar makes for Roswitha. Reading some of the reviews above, I'm astonished at the lack of empathy and imagination displayed by the reviewers. As a Christian--even a lax one--I find nothing depraved or obscene in this movie. It is something you have to watch with a historical perspective. Nazi youth rallies were exercises in mass hysteria, just as the one shown here. Oskar's parents had to be watchful in case the police caught him--as a dwarf, he was in danger of being euthanized. There are many instances of a police state that I could mention but will not.

The performances are marvelous. Angela Winker is great as the mother carrying on an affair with Bronski under the oblivious eyes of the family. Mario Adorf as Matzerath plays a warm, caring man who is caught up in the Nazi craziness. He understands that his wife is cheating on him but ignores it for the sake of the family. Daniel Olbrychski is the elegant and befuddled Bronski to a T. David Bennent's eyes sometimes remind me of the kids in Village of the Damned, but he's always convincing."
"Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover, The (1989)","With the Cook, the Thief, his Wife and her Lover, Greenaway creates a self-contained world that is both a fabrication and abstraction of reality, but also an extremist reflection (nee, microcosm) of British society in the nineteen-eighties. The characters that he chooses to put forward to the audience as protagonists are archetypes of social and political caricatures that we would find in that particular decade; but heightened to conform to the over-the-top opulence/pestilence found central to the plot. His ability to craft characters and situations that resonate beyond the context of a particular scenario, coupled with his bitterness and unwillingness to conform is what sets him up as a satirist of serious note. He also elevates the film beyond the realms of mere art-house experimentation by fashioning a seriously funny script, which has ample opportunities for central character Albert Spica to prove himself the ultimate charismatic bully - part cockney hard man, part pantomime villain - who is never less than compulsively terrifying.

The plot is a simple construct centred on the theme of revenge and the need for personal freedom. This is mixed in with the socio-political undertones as well as Greenaway's many references to art, theatre, film and literature. It is also elevated by the impeccable cinematic qualities that we hold synonymous with the director's work. Everything here is about pushing things beyond the reasonable limitations; so we have a stunningly intricate set that is both theatrically simplistic, but also as other-worldly as anything from the work of say Gilliam or Jeunet. The costumes by Jean Paul Gaultier scream over-the-top chic, whilst often mirroring the use of colour employed by the production designers. Greenaway even breaks continuity by having Helen Mirren's costumes change colour as she moves through each room of the restaurant, so that we have a green dress in the kitchen, a red dress in the dinning area (inspired by Hitchcock's vertigo no less) and a white dress in the lavatory. It's an audacious move, but one that pays off in the creation of a completely self-contained world; something that is further established by Sacha Vierny's sumptuous cinematography and the wonderfully bombastic music of the ever-excellent Michael Nyman.

Some have clearly found the film's various abstractions problematic (yes, it is theatrical, yes it is occasionally shocking, and yes, it does evolve in a world of its own ostentatious creation). But it's also as artistic a film as you can get; a fact that some here have disputed. The reason that some define this as artistic refers to the use of colour, light and composition. The architecture of the sets too, and the way in which the production designers have chosen to dress them also adds to the artistic stylisation of the film. These factors are important to the narrative, as they are symbolic to what Greenaway is trying to convey, as well as what the characters are all about. Because of this, the design of the film becomes AS important as the framework, if not more so. But this film is more than a mere arty exploration; it's funny and intelligent and features a slew of great performances from a wonderfully eclectic cast. Michael Gambon as the thief Spica gives a grandstand performance to rival his own Phillip Marlow from The Singing Detective; hamming things up spectacularly but still retaining that much needed sense of humanity. The same can be said of the other principals too.

Mirren as the wife exudes a quite and restrained sexuality in what must be her best performance, whist Richard Bohringer as the cook is in some represents the linchpin/catalyst for the film. Elsewhere we find everyone from Tim Roth to Ian Dury popping up to give the film some added character and easily furthering the film's already cult appeal. This was a turning point for Greenaway; a move towards the more expressive, elaborate and self-contained style of film-making found in films like Prospero's Books and the Baby of Maçon and away from the more easy to digest classics like the Draughtsman's Contract, Drowning by Numbers and A Zed and Two Noughts."
"Crow: City of Angels, The (1996)","The Crow: City of Angels is the sequel to the amazing 1994 film ""The Crow."" While in some ways it tries too hard to be like the first, the film also succeeds in other areas, such as emotion and style. While not as good as it could have been, it is still pretty enjoyable.

Story: The film begins in post-apocalyptic Los Angeles, with a grown up Sarah, who as you may recall, is the little girl from the original. She has visions of another man rising up. In comes Ashe, a single father raising a son, Danny. Ashe and Danny accidentally witness a gang attack, and therefore, are attacked and killed themselves. Guess what happens? Ashe returns from the grave to seek vengeance. One by one, Ashe hunts down those responsible for his murder, which eventually leads him to Judah, a drug kingpin and crime lord of the city. The story really focuses on Ashe's pain of losing his sun, and there are some really powerful and emotional moments in the film.

Directing: Tim Pope is an acclaimed music video director, and his knack for music videos really shines in this film. While he sets and certain mood and doesn't let it up, the movie really jumbles around in terms of style. It's like watching one huge rock video, and at time, it can be a little hard on the eyes. Most scenes were staged quite well, and other than the style, Pope did an adequate job.

Acting: Vincent Perez(Ashe) did an excellent job with his part. He had a lot to contend with, such as filling Brandon Lee's shoes. Regardless, he shined, and in his scenes of pain and grief, I really felt for him. Bravo. Mia Kirshner(Sarah) did great with what she had. I felt that the character was wasted in the film, but she did fine. Richard Brooks(Judah) played the sadistic drug-lord quite effectively, although I never really had an opinion of the character either way. That could be the fault of Brooks, the director, or the writer. I'm not sure which. Iggy Pop(Curve) overacted beyond belief, and I was quite amused.

Score: Once again Graeme Revelle proved himself an excellent composer. His music helps the mood incredibly. I only wish more of his music was in the film, and less of the hard rock.

Violence: While it is felt and implied everywhere, there really isn't tons of on screen violence, and when it was there, it wasn't overly bloody, though it had quite a brutal feel to it. The violence was in your face, and not overly entertaining or exciting like in the first film.

Profanity/Sexual Themes: Strong language throughout. The f-bomb is used all through the film. There is also a lot of S&M in the film, as well as female nudity.

Substance Abuse: The film is about a drug-lord, so, there is quite a bit of drug use in the film. Almost all the villain characters snort the coke-like drug, Trinity.

Overall: The Crow: City of Angels was a decent sequel, and really excelled in some ares, although it failed in others. If you're a fan of the first, it's worth a look. I really dug the fact that the movie was mostly about the pain of losing a loved one. It's a pretty stylish adventure. 7/10"
Michael Collins (1996),"For me as a fan of Ireland, having read the history of the Irish and having visited the island several times, this is a compelling piece of contemporary history. With a cast of names, all quite a bit younger, it was nice to see it again. The film reflects the true story quite well, and is grippingly directed to boot.

Since the whole story is set in the years (1916-1922), the film doesn't seem dusty either, despite being 28 years old by now. Liam Neeson and Alan Rickman are convincing all along the line, Julia Roberts is more of a supporting character who doesn't leave a lasting impression. But it is also more about politics, patriotism and the great dream of freedom. A detailed examination of the person Michael Collins, in which the early phase of the ""IRA"" is retold with good action and archive footage worth seeing. It moved me and gave me interesting background knowledge.

Anyone interested in contemporary Irish history should not miss this highlight.

------------ Conclusion: Excellent."
"Ruling Class, The (1972)","A scathing and profoundly witty attack on Britain's social and political institutions with Peter O'Toole on his best ever form as Jack, the Son of an English Earl who inherits his Father's estate when the old man accidentally kills himself via auto-erotic asphyxiation. The only problem for Jack's relatives is that he's a paranoid Schziophrenic who thinks he's Jesus and they're quick to move for his indefinite committal when he starts to talk about the relinquishing of material possessions and tolerance toward all men. The Ruling Class is a film of two halves. The first is some of the best character comedy you'll ever see. As ""JC"" who wears glasses because he's cold, O'Toole commands every scene benefiting from some superbly written monologues and one liners, the standout being his pre-wedding speech on the cross and he's assisted by the creme de la creme of British character actors, Arthur Lowe a standout as the newly liberated Trokskyite Butler Tuck with a blatant contempt for his old masters. The second half however, is dark stuff indeed - jet black in fact. Apparenty 'cured' after an arranged confrontation with the AC-DC messiah, Jack dresses as a Victorian gentleman, talks about capital punishment and superior breeding and concerns no-one, the fact he believes himself to be Jack the Ripper going completely unnoticed by his peers who prime him for his climatic accession to the House of Lords. The conceit is milked for all its worth and the final scenes with a hallucinatory Jack looking at his fellow peers in the House as decayed corpses is a particularly chilling postscript to the story. Subtle? No way but its sledgehammer to the concept of patronage and privilege as a criteria for governance and influence. Like the best satire its savage, angry stuff - possibly overlong and too conscious of its theatrical origins but ultimately no less caustic or inventive for it. Class indeed."
Real Genius (1985),"It has often been said that once you love ""Weird Science"" you'll also like ""Real Genius"". And while I guess this is true, I really wouldn't place both movies into the same category an onto the same level.

This is really a movie in the vain of other great, classic goofball '80's comedies, focusing on young students. Looking back at it, this really was the golden age for comedies and the lovers of the genre and time period will surely be able to appreciate this movie.

And I can certainly appreciate this movie as well, for what it is. That doesn't mean that I can simply ignore all of its flaws and weaknesses as well though. The movie is fun but that is about all that the movie is.

One of the things that I thought the movie was really lacking in was its story. And I'm not just talking about its main premise but more so about all of its developments, the way things progress and the characters. I guess part of this can also be blamed on the directing by Martha Coolidge, since the main premise itself remains still quite good and fun. I just could never really get involved with its story or its characters, which was a real shame, since this seemed to be what the movie was really pushing for. It wanted you to really love all of its characters and made some of them as goofy as possible.

But really the only character that truly works out and becomes a greatly fun and memorable one is the Val Kilmer character. But this in itself is still enough to make the movie a real fun and entertaining one to watch! It makes it once more obvious what a waste it is that Val Kilmer never really broke through as a comedy actor and didn't do more movies like this during his career. Most people now days only known and recognize him for his serious movie roles. In this movie he looked almost as outrageous as he does now days and that is saying a lot! Val Kilmer his look has changed very drastically over the last couple of years and with change I mean his pretty extreme sudden weight gain, while he was once a true Hollywood heartthrob.

The sort of 'childish' '80's teenage comedy approach is what makes the movie actually charming and in a way also irresistible to watch. It provides the movie with plenty of crazy situations, as well as some serious teenage issues, that still appeal and apply to teenagers this present day. This is also really what makes these genre movies from the '80's such timeless ones and are also really the reason why some of them are still being so popular to watch now days.

I would exactly classify this movie as one of the classics- or best examples for its genre but it's definitely worth giving a go.

Benny & Joon (1993),"Aidan Quinn is a weird character, he acts well enough in the situations where he rarely needs to be serious and acts weird and boring where the situation is troublesome. The story is very good, but the direction faltered somewhere in the middle and I lost interest in the dialogues. Dialogues is an element which makes up a lot for such movies and they were irrelevant and messy.

On the other side, Johnny Depp is an acting masterclass. He knows how to deliver words, punctuations and breaks between the words. Where the presence of Depp always shines, the presence of other two makes the screen dull, because most of the dialogues are not really like that how mentally ill people would behave. It is understandable that as the title says, Benjamin and Joon are the protagonists, then why the movie's title introduced Depp as the main character? Was it because Depp was already a popular actor back then? Still it doesn't suffice the purpose. Moreover, the chemistry of Quinn and Juliann Moore just slows down the screenplay. There should have been something strong that connects them well with the story.

There are also many scenes which are filled with music or songs in the presence of Benny and Joon and it didn't really help the screen get closer to me. A crisp writing for the mentally challenged people could have been good. Something more serious and exciting like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest might have made the story brilliant."
"Saint, The (1997)","Yes, Leslie Charteris would probably like this movie -- but not me. The way I see The Saint is much the way George Sanders and Louis Hayward interpreted him. A debonair scourge of spies and criminals, The Saint steps in where the official police are afraid to tread or unable to investigate. Now there is nothing debonair about Val Kilmer. Nothing particularly likable either -- except for the fact that he bests the villains and can run fast. I don't blame the heroine for being confused, for The Saint himself -- as presented here -- is a confusing character. The script even takes time out to let us know WHY he is confused. It all happened in his childhood, see, when he was a victimized Oliver Twist in an orphanage -- but not just an ordinary orphanage. As I pointed out in other reviews, many modern movies are determined to throw off the shackles of the past and come out fighting mad. In this case, it's the Catholic Church that gets a firm drubbing with a sadistic priest presented as a fiend from hell. These childhood episodes really have little to do with the main action but are presented mainly for their shock value. The film, which is a mite too long at 112 minutes away, would be better off without them. Introduce Kilmer right from the start and you would have a more compact, less talkative and far more suspenseful movie."
Amistad (1997),"Steven Spielberg has created a painfully flawed film about the Amistad rebellion. Part of what makes this film a difficult, even at times offensive experience is the way the film is more interested in white male subjectivity (should this surprise us based on the creative teams identities) over any subjective concerns about the African characters. Real hard questions need to be asked about the historical inaccuracies and distortions and how these are used to suggest that there was a much larger white reaction against slavery than really existed at the time of the rebellion. It is difficult to not compare this film to Schindler's List and to see what Spielberg can do with a film about a holocaust. The ""fictionally"" created Black abolishionist character portrayed by Morgan Freeman is so utterly under utilized and under dramatized that he could be removed entirely from the film without in any way disrupting the narrative. The actual historical facts of this fascinating rebellion and the legal struggle to free the African prisoners is so much more interesting than anything the entertainment team has come with in this horrible, offensive, mess."
Tomorrow Never Dies (1997),"This is a good movie and all but this isn't a James Bond like movie. You take a war plot....... with an Sylvester Stallone gun fights and you just add bond into it. Brosnan does a good job here.......... you cant notice his age and he doesn't shove the one liners down our throats like Moore. I think the bad parts of this movie were the useless henchman who gets little buildup and doesn't do anything but stand around and look tough. I hated this air thin plot because the main villain completely destroys it. The villain should do something evil or have a nice background and buildup but this villain is just irritating and boring. Michelle Yeoh is OK here but you can tell that she doesn't have any chemistry with Brosnan and you barely know what shes doing. I enjoyed the remote control car sequences (including the hilarious part with Q). The best part was the the car chase with Bond using the remote control to drive. I was a little surprised at how they changed Bond to using machine guns and killing people without a heart or hesitation. The theme song was good as were some of the action scenes, It just doesn't feel like a Bond film."
"Replacement Killers, The (1998)","THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS

Aspect ratio: 2.39:1

Sound formats: Dolby Digital / SDDS-8

John Woo (who else?) co-produced this debut US vehicle for Asian superstar Chow Yun-fat (or 'Mr. Fat', as he's known to some careless movie fans), in which Chow plays a hired killer pursued by ruthless gangster Kenneth Tsang Kong (BISHONEN) after refusing to assassinate the family of a cop (Michael Rooker) who killed Tsang's son during a drugs bust. Mira Sorvino plays the plucky con artist hired by Chow to provide him with forged documents so he can flee the country, only to find herself caught up in Tsang's lust for vengeance, as monstrous hit men Til Schweiger (DER BEWEGTE MANN) and Danny Trejo (BLOOD IN BLOOD OUT) arrive on the scene to exterminate both Chow and his immediate family. For all its flashy visuals and explosive soundtrack, Antoine Fuqua's derivative film ploughs a well-worn furrow, slavishly imitating the Hong Kong action-thrillers which first brought Chow to Hollywood's attention, whilst completely disregarding the emotional/thematic resonance that distinguishes Asian cinema from its western counterparts. Chow is OK, as usual, but the part doesn't require him to do very much, and the entire cast (including an underused Jürgen Prochnow) plays second fiddle to the slam-bang pyrotechnics. Routine stuff, with few redeeming features."
Burnt By the Sun (1994),"Like most film lovers I prize invention, originality and formal daring. BURNT BY THE SUN is a very conservative historical epic, full of sweeping scenes paralelling intimate domestic exchanges; theatrical framings and acting with lots of dialogue; Jarre-esque sugary Romantic music; a fetishisation of nature.

Nevertheless, I loved this film to bits, for all these reasons. it was as rich as a novel (although it is an original), yet full of the vibrancy, life, violence, anger, and comedy absent from most literary adaptations. There is also a sense of using a cliched mode to attack its assumptions, as Chekhovian comedy turns into a denunciation of totalitarianism, and a more absurdist register.

Mikhalkov's filming of a superficially ugly Russia is lyrical and emotionally charged, and his own performance is like watching an oak tree being systematically hacked, sublime in its reach. Packed with memorable, searing set-pieces, but the filming of Marusya's confusion on Mitya's return, or his story to Nadya, shot with Nicholas Ray's feel for decor, stand out for me."
Red Corner (1997),"I remember watching the trailer for this... I've seen it more times than I've bothered to count, since it's on several films I have on VHS from that period(and I *love* trailers, I rarely surpass any chance to watch them). So the trailer for this film was in my mind for a long time before I realized what it was about or even what the title was. To this day, I can pretty much remember the entire trailer, despite the fact that I haven't seen it in at least three to five years. I believe this was the first place I ever saw Gere, and I know it was the first place I saw Bai. I don't know when I first saw this film, or if I did, really, before tonight. I had a feeling of deja-vu through some scenes, but if I have indeed seen this film before, it certainly can't have made much of a lasting impression on me. Whether that is the fault of the film or merely a sign of me having a quite low interest in political matters in my younger days, I leave up to debate. The plot is quite well-written, and mostly realistic and plausible, if a bit aimed at the Chinese legal system and the people in general(I realize that they and their system is a Communist one, but this does seem a tad over the top, exaggerated). The film also contains a bit too much Hollywood for an otherwise quite realistic depiction of another country's court and legal system, one that is in stark contrast to that of the American system. Some forced(granted, the chemistry is most definitely there), not to mention quite unlikely, romance, a chase scene, etc. The pacing is solid. The acting is top-notch. The writing and direction are marred by obvious sinophobia - hate and fear of China - and a lack of objectivity when dealing with this subject. The writer obviously did extensive research into the culture and court system for this film, but unfortunately, these truths are mixed with preconceptions and prejudice of said system(and possibly of the culture as well), making for a skewed perspective of the reality of the Chinese courts and prisons. The cinematography and editing are quite impressive, not too flashy but intense and effective when the occasion calls for them to be. All in all, a pretty good court-room thriller with all the elements, but the anti-Communism just seems a tad too extreme. I recommend this to fans of thrillers, Richard Gere and politically themed dramas... just watch out, or you might get caught in the maelstrom of blind hatred towards China. 7/10"
Jumanji (1995),"A child living in an up-and-coming town in the 1960's discovers a crate which was buried a long time ago (1869 - as established at the start of the film). Inside the crate is a board game. One night, he and his friend Sarah, start playing the board game. The board game, however, isn't all it seems to be, as the children soon learn. Allan is sucked into the board game and Sarah is chased out of the house by bats. Twenty six years things are different. The town is a run-down ghost of its previous self, the disappearance of Allan is a folklore in which his dad supposedly cut him into pieces and hid his body parts, and Sarah is a psychic with emotional issues as nobody believed what she witnessed as a child. Allan's old house has new inhabitants. Orphaned children and their aunt are moving in. The children discover the board game and start playing. Unbeknown to them, they free Allan Parrish, now, much older. They also free the board game to continue its mayhem and chaos in a jungle theme. To stop all the mayhem and chaos they must first finish the game, to finish the game they need all the players, including Sarah. All the random events that the board game throws up come face to face with modern 1990's living.

This is a great family film from the 1990's and is a lot of fun for everybody. It used special effect techniques at the time which were revolutionary but haven't aged that well. The story and plot too are a bit generic, but are by no means weak - just occasionally predictable (but hey, it's a family film, it's hardly going to randomly kill off half the cast). The casting and acting throughout was good. I'm not usually a fan of Robin Williams because I tended to find his approach a little to full-on and in-your-face, in this film however he has a wider array of emotions to show off. As well as Williams, there are stars of yester-year and the future littered amongst the scenes, notably Kirsten Dunst appears as a child actor here. It's clear to see why this was a blockbuster of its time.

Beyond the obvious situations/events on-screen which younger audiences will primarily follow, there are more subtle events unfolding which offer a lot of depth to film savvy minds; such as multiverse's, fragmented realities, time travel, butterfly effects, inanimate objects with powers. Packaged the way it is, there is something for all in this classic.

FTR, I'm watching this as an adult in 2018, prior to watching the current Jumanji film, although some of the effects in this original look a little dated, it's nothing that'll put you off. I can confidently say that almost twenty years after it was released, this film is as good as it was in the 1990's. 7 out of 10 from me, thanks for reading and enjoy"
Father of the Bride Part II (1995),"The other day I was renting Father of the Bride and I figured to go ahead and grab the sequel. The great thing about it is that the original cast was back so I thought this had a good chance of being as good as the first. So I watched the first Father of the Bride and really loved it, so I watched Part 2 right afterwards, I have to say this movie is a bit unbelievable. Now getting pregnant the same time as your mother, it's cool, I can believe it because my grandmother and great grandmother were both pregnant at the same time, but they didn't give birth at the same time at the same hospital. That just seemed a little too ""coincidental"" and out of the blue. But Father of the Bride Part 2 still delivers good laughs even if the plot is predictable and unbelievable.

George and the family are doing well and are just enjoying life, he's even grown to like Bryan. When Annie and Bryan come over, they announce big news that they are pregnant, everyone is so excited, except for George who has just accepted his daughter being married, now he's going to be a grandpa? But the plot thickens, Nina is pregnant too with George's baby, like mother, like daughter, and when Bryan has to go out of town for work, George has to take over, but with Franck Eggelhoffer's help, that won't be too hard.

Father of the Bride Part 2 is predictable and like I said it does get ridicules at times, but it still is a fun film for you and the family. I have to admit that the ending was very sweet, but I won't give that away, you'll have to see for yourself. Steve Martin, I felt so bad for him how hard he was trying to take care of his wife and daughter at the same time, poor guy. Franck Eggelhoffer really delivers the laughs this round, he and Steve, when George falls asleep and Annie goes into labor, Franck tries to carry George and has a hard time is so funny. Fater of the Bride Part 2 is worth the time and look, it's a cute movie over all.

Fair Game (1995),"****SPOILERS***** Action packed police movie set in Florida about a group of mobsters consisting of ex-KGB agents led by former KBG agent Kazak, Steven Berkoff. The mobsters use an off-shore freighter, The Tortugo, to tap into underwater bank cables and steal millions of dollars in bank transactions. That plan falls apart when the feisty and pretty civil lawyer Kate McQueen, Cindy Crawford, got in their way and had to be eliminated in order for them to keep up their illegal activities.

Attempting to assassinate Kate at the beginning of the movie as she was jogging down swanky Ocean Drive she has Homicide Detective Max Kirpatrick, William Baldwin, assigned to be with her around the clock to watch protect and defend her, it's a real hard job but somebody's got to do it, against other attempts on her life. This gang of ex-KGB thugs really mean business as they blow up half of South Florida to get the pair, Max & Kate. As usual, in the movies, Max & Kate are always one step ahead of them and the mobsters no matter how much men and firepower as well as electronic equipment that they have are no match against the two who have almost nothing but the clothes on their back, and some times not even that, to fight them with. Far more violent then most action police movies with almost the entire cast wiped out, with the exception of Max & Kate of course, by the ending credits.

The action scenes of ""Fair Game"" are a lot like the old Saturday afternoon cliff-hangers with Max & Kate looking like they've had it and then just getting away from the bad guys every fifteen or so minutes in the movie. The bad guys are as bad as they can get in what they do and try to do, you can just imagine anyone trying to hurt or kill Cindy Crawford has to be the biggest enemy against hu-MAN-ity in history.

The last half-hour of the movie is non-stop action on the roads and highways as well as railroad trains and ships in the South Florida area with the most graphic boat sinking since, even though movie was made in 1995 but I haven't seen it until 2004, the movie ""Titanic"" in 1997.

Outlandish but at the same time ironic ending with the head gangster Kazak instead of trying to escape the sinking and exploding ship tries to punch into the ships computer the information that he needs to complete his illegal bank transaction of almost one billion dollars! All this with him knowing very well that he won't make it out alive by taking so much time doing it! It's as if Kazak just wanted to die rich."
Screamers (1995),"Screamers from 1995 based on the Phillip K. Dick short story ""Second Variety"" follows Hendricksson(Peter Weller) on the planet Sirius 6b, a once thriving mining operation now the setting for an uneasy standoff between two factions the Alliance and the New Economic Bloc(N.E.B.). Hendricksson has grown weary of the cold war taking a passive approach to the situation while allowing self replicating killing machines known as Screamers to bear the brunt of the burden, but when an opportunity arrives to possibly end the cold war he travels to the N.E.B. base in the hopes of kickstarting negotiations only to find that other forces are at play that pose a threat to both factions.

The movie in its opening act is terrific in setting up its world and characters on its relatively shoestring budget. Sirius 6b is a desolate wasteland where the the only inhabitants are soldiers who's only relief from the boredom are the occasional skirmishes with N.E.B. forces or screeches from the titular screamers to break up the monotony. Weller in particular does a good job as the battle weary commander Hendricksson and in the opening half of the film we get some great world building and atmosphere taking us through the desolation and ruination of this once thriving mining colony.

Unfortunately at about the half way point the movie begins to wear its influences on its sleeves as it begins to try cramming in the paranoia from John Carpenter's The Thing, the military intensity of Aliens, and even some transhumanist themes from fellow Dick adaptation Blade Runner. The second half is so chaotic and overly cluttered that it ceases feeling like its own story and instead feels like a cut and paste job of the previous 10 years worth of science fiction films. Even the design of some of the Screamers become blatantly Giger-esque not helping the Aliens comparisons.

Screamers is not a bad movie, there's genuine trade craft on display and there's clear passion in front of and behind the camera, but one can't help feeling a sense of deja vu thinking they've seen this movie before but better. It's perfectly serviceable as a rental, but you'll most likely forget having seen it in about a day."
Beautiful Girls (1996),"(Maybe you should read this after watching the movie. I don't know if reading it before will spoil it for you--I doubt it, in fact, but you never know.)

Being the typical unmarried man, I rented ""Beautiful Girls"" because of its attractive title. I had no idea it could be so moving or endearing. I may be just getting soft, but it was one of the few films I have thought about for more than 72 hours after I saw it.

Aside from all the sexual content, swearing, etc., the dialogue between Marty (the now beautiful Natalie Portman) and Willie (my favorite actor, Timothy Hutton) is nothing short of astounding. Willie is enchanted and attracted to this little 13-year old girl next door. As they exchange more and more conversation, he realizes her great potential and even dreams about how he might just be able to wait ten years and maybe marry her.

The scene in which Willie discusses his feelings with Mo, his married friend was the turning point of the story. Willie realizes that, even if she had a love-at-first-sight crush on him, she would drift away as she matures; she would find someone closer to her own age, and Willie would become just some silly old man she met when she was young and had a ridiculous, immature attraction to. He realizes that by just being her friend, he will be able to keep her in a much more real way than if he tries to wait for her to be his lover.

But the one scene I will remember forever, the most perfect scene in the entire movie, in which the dialogue seemed neither forced nor over-elongated, was the scene in the ice-skating rink with Marty and Willie. Marty tells Willie all the things he would have liked to hear before his talk with Mo. She would marry him after they waited five years, etc. The association Willie makes with Winnie the Pooh and Christopher Robins is so beautiful it almost made me cry. (Not really, but you get the point). He gives her a good taste of reality, and she seems mature enough to understand.

In a later scene, Willie tells Marty that he would like to continue being a friend, even a mentor to her, and he has total confidence that whatever she does will be amazing.

There are about three other stories intertwined into the movie, but the Portman-Hutton line stands out as the superior.

Overall, a wonderful movie to which they should have given a title that would attract people with the ability to be moved.

P.S. The funniest part of the entire movie is the confused look Willie and Paul exchange after Mo gives unusually-phrased threats to Steven, who beat up their friend. You have to have seen the movie to understand"
Happy Gilmore (1996),"Golf is dreadfully boring. Thankfully, films like Caddyshack and Happy Gilmore posses ambition to bring fun to the green. Both are fresh ideas that use their actors to motivate their screenplay. Unfortunately, Happy Gilmore manages to drive itself into the high grass area shortly when the game commences. Let's watch...

Happy Gilmore is often cited as ""Sandler's funniest film."" I'm not sure he has one. I recently did a fairly lengthy blog post on the subject of Sandler's films and tried my hardest to find the one that made me laugh and enjoy thoroughly. I'd probably say his best piece of work had to be Funny People. Was it funny? Not a whole lot, but it was enjoyable and a step in the right direction Sandler quickly abandoned.

The story of Happy Gilmore is simple; a loud, energetic, aspiring hockey player of the same name takes up golf when he finds out he has a powerful swing. He has serious anger management issues, and because of that, somehow, he attracts the gorgeous Julie Bowen, who plays a Public Relations Director, and also, a fellow golf player named Shooter McGavin (McDonald) who wants Gilmore off the face of the golf world.

What Gilmore desperately wants to accomplish is getting $270,000 so he can buy back his grandmother's house that was recently taken away by the IRS because of failure to meet tax payments over the last decade.

There's the setup, compiled of the obligatory sports movie and love story clichés, but the main problem is, well, Sandler's character. The Happy Gilmore character is odd, annoying, and aggravating. This is what you call a film's desperate attempt at comedy. Gilmore is easily fatigued, which is why his character is seriously hard to like or side with. The character gets into fights every few minutes, resulting in lame, cartoonish blows to the face and also to Sandler's personal ego.

It seems the film couldn't succeed in the writing portion and went immediately to the punching, kicking, ""things didn't go my way"" kind of slapstick. Keep in mind that if you read many of my reviews you'll know I am a fan of silly slapstick. It takes a certain mood and a very likable lead actor to pull off good slapstick. I wonder if Chris Farley could've brought more coherent likability to the Happy Gilmore character.

Also, the product placement is shamefully explicit. I'm aware it's golf, and like every other sport, is known to display product placement around the field, but when doing it in a film it appears that some of the big name companies are put in for the money - not the realism of the source material. Especially the utterly shameless marketing for Subway. Have mercy.

When compared to present day Adam Sandler, Happy Gilmore has a harmless innocence to it. It's not harmful in any way, except maybe your tolerance level. Sandler finds will be at home with this, while others will search the screenplay high and low for the real humor.

But, the film does deliver laughs, just not consistently. There's nothing more uncomfortable than watching a comedy, that is supposed to be funny, but isn't. Happy Gilmore gets laughs, but a lot of them aren't distinct in any way. I think the most memorable scene is when Bob Barker and Happy Gilmore square off on the green. I think one of Barker's lines before the scene should've been ""humor, come on down!"" Starring: Adam Sandler, Julie Bowen, Christopher McDonald, and Carl Weathers. Directed by: Dennis Dugan."
Boomerang (1992),"This film surprised me. I wouldn't expect a film starring Eddie Murphy, Martin Lawrence, David Alan Grier, Halle Berry and Robin Givens to be an amusing, quirky, and well-acted film. Each of them have talent in their own right, but are normally type-cast actors who are predictable in terms of what to expect. Well Grier, Givens and Berry gave no surprises. And Martin Lawrence, though he played his role to a tee, was pretty much Martin Lawrence. The real surprise was Murphy. This is the true Eddie Murphy charisma. A character that is beyond what I would normally expect from him, this film proves that he has talent, and was pretty much the peak of his career. If for no other reason than because it's not simply another goofy comedy a la Golden Child or Coming to America. Those films are really funny, but here, Murphy proves that he can act, too...and I don't think he's ever done it again. The problems with this film were few. The supporting cast were fairly strong...even though some were quite predictable in terms of character, they still worked out well. Robin Givens was a bit one-dimensional, but she served her purpose well. David Alan Grier was a weakness; he went overboard in this role; he played the same role in a much stronger manner (also opposite Halle Berry) in Strictly Business. And the smaller roles were all amusing: Grace Jones was hilarious, especially the restaurant scene! Leonard Jackson's facial expressions were priceless, John Witherspoon was great (as was the whole Thanksgiving dinner!!) and Geoffrey Holder was funny and charismatic as the quirky commercial designer, Nelson. So what were the problems? Well the length was an issue. This film could've been 20-30 minutes shorter; two hours is just too much. Start by cutting out the sex scenes, they were yawnable and pretty much useless. Look It's Robin Givens in her panties. Look it's Robin Givens in her panties again. And guess what? Yup, three time's the charm, Robin Givens in her panties once again...granted, Robin Givens is quite the looker, but not on top of Eddie Murphy. And this film really didn't need it. While we're at it, you can take out the whole Eartha Kitt-Eddie Murphy seduction scene. Could have been done in a quarter of the time, and frankly the whole scene still makes me shudder;) As well, the cinematography was poor, with generic shots an choppy cuts (and worse fades). Now, I don't expect art-school experimentation, nor do I expect Coen Brothers quality, but they could've at least made it look pretty. The scenes are nice, but they do nothing with them. This is textbook film-making. All in all, the film is a fun watch. The scenes that are on are *really* on; absolutely hilarious. As it is the film's quite good. Cut out even fifteen minutes and the film would be so much better! 7/10"
"Addiction, The (1995)","In the sister film to the Funeral philosophy student Kathleen Conklin is dragged into an alley and bitten by Casanova and left to bleed. Despite hospital care she begins to change and have strange desires. With her desires controlling her turns to Peina for help.

A sister film in that both film share a crew, a writer and some of the cast. The genres are very different but the themes are the same  religion and redemption. The vampire thing isn't played like it usually is  stakes through the heart etc, these are mentioned but not laboured. Instead the story is about the origins of sin and the extent it controls us and how we can be redeemed. It cleverly uses the vampire myth as an allegory for wider human evil  `We are not sinners because we sin, we sin because we are sinners. We aren't evil because we do evil, we do evil because we are evil'.

At times it gets a little heavy  the ending in particular takes some interpretation and the message can be easily misunderstood. However ignoring the message this also stands up as a great vampire film  the party which turns into a massacre is as good (if not better) then the nightclub opening of Blade, and much more meaningful to boot. Ferrara is a master director who has never followed the money to blockbusters  here he is in total control of his themes and the film rarely loses focus. His clever use of music is also good  a blend of all styles. The theme song feels like it's going to be a 1980's romantic comedy, but this blends straight into hip-hop and others to create a mix that never feels strange  in fact a baseline seems to run under the whole film like a heartbeat.

Lili Taylor is on top form as Conklin and commands attention the whole time. Walken and Sciorra are both good but have less screen time than in the Funeral, however here, as there, they have key lines of dialogue that carry tremendous weight. Sopranos co-stars Falco and Imperioli are both good but are no more than bit players. The real stars are Ferrara and writer Nicolas St John, who wrote this and The Funeral after the death of his son.

Overall this is a great film that serves up more for thought than for action. To this end it won't please those expecting a Blade style vampire film but to fans of Ferrara used to his themes this will be very enjoyable."
Casper (1995),"Who says there are no such things as ghosts? Not if there is the ghostly inhabitants of Whipstaff Manor in Friendship, Maine! This desolate mansion is then, in the words of one of the members of the Ghostly Trio of Whipstaff, 'intruded' by Kat Harvey (Christina Ricci) and her eccentric father Dr. James Harvey (Bill Pullman), a ghost therapist. Carrigan Crittenden (Cathy Moriarty) had hired Dr. Harvey to exorcise the ghosts, including Casper the friendly ghost and his three obnoxious uncles, Stretch, Fatso and Stinkie, aspiring to gain Whipstaff's 'buried gold'.

Intertwining humour, all-time fun and a modern Cinderella story, 'Casper' promises to please as a movie which is compelling, hilarious, captivating, heart-warming, witty and above all, truly 'fleshtastic'.

'Casper' is recommended for any audience, regardless of age. At the time I am submitting this review I am currently 17, turning 18, but 'Casper' still manages to appear endearing and ultimately special. The magic of Bill Pullman, Christina Ricci as well as that of director Brad Silberling, executive producer Steven Spielberg, and other producers weaves between each and every scene to eventually lift us off our feet. Above all, I LOVE THIS MOVIE! Casper is my all time favourite character. Truly fantastic. You won't BOOlieve it until you see it."
Congo (1995),"I remember watching 'Congo' in the cinema back in 1995 and I loved it! It was only afterwards did I realise how much other people (and when I say 'other people' I generally mean the critics!) absolutely hated it. And, although I obviously don't agree, I can see why - from a certain point of view.

In 1993 'Jurassic Park' was epically adapted from a Michael Crichton novel and... well, the Box Office and impact on films and popular culture spoke for itself. Therefore, when 'Congo' was pitched from another Crichton novel, it was 'sold' to the masses as 'Jurassic Park with gorillas.' Yes, if you saw any of the trailers or marketing material around the time of its release, you'd get the impression the human stars were going to be going up against hordes of savage, mutated gorillas in the jungle. And, although that does happen, it can hardly be described as the 'main' portion of the film. In fact... would it be a 'spoiler' to say that the 'bad gorillas' only come into the story in the final act?

What 'Congo' is about is a bit of a 'mish-mash.' You have a scientist (Dylan Walsh) who's trained a gorilla to use sign language and to 'speak' through the help of a virtual-reality glove, returning her to the film (in the 'Congo' - surprise!), teaming up with an ex CIA operative (Laura Linney) who's looking for her ex fiancé because he disappeared while searching for a new form of diamond for a telecommunications company. Throw in an eccentric Hungarian (Tim Curry) who's looking for a lost city in the jungle and a suave British local guide (Ernie Hudson) and you generally have a lot going on. Is it any wonder that the film-makers simple figured it would be easier just to sell it as 'Jurassic Park with gorillas?'

However, despite having a lot to cover plot-wise, it's actually pretty good. It's not so much about 'man versus mutant gorilla,' rather the group versus everything you'd expect (and more!) to find in that area of the world. You have the local tribes, the harsh elements, corrupt military and hungry, hungry hippos (yes, seriously). First of all, it's an adventure film. The bad gorillas are simply one part of a much bigger film.

It's no dramatic masterpiece. In fact, Laura Linney and Dylan Walsh are two pretty uninspiring leads. The true outstanding performances come from Ernie Hudson and Tim Curry who - probably - should have been the two leads as their bantering and performances is what makes the film (in terms of human leads).

The other notable 'cast members' are the gorillas themselves. Although computer effects did wonders at bringing dinosaurs back a few years earlier, the technology still wasn't there to make furry gorillas look realistic, so animatronics and practical effects were used instead. These were masterminded by Stan Winston and, although they aren't perfect, they are as pretty close to holding up today as any film made in 1995.

If you're expecting a wall-to-wall action film where man must survive against great big, nasty gorillas who are picking them off one by one, then you won't find it here. If, however, you're looking for a good old fashioned action/adventure film that could be watched by all the family on a Saturday afternoon, then this will certainly kill a couple of hours."
Devil in a Blue Dress (1995),"Devil In A Blue Dress takes the classic Raymond Chandler mystery form and uproots it just a smidge, setting it in the African American community of 1948 Los Angeles, with terrific results. Noir takes on a double meaning (naughty pun) as WWII vet turned private eye Ezekial ""Easy"" Rawlins (Denzel Washington) finds himself mired in the quick sands of corruption, coersion and murder most foul after taking on a job that's led him straight to the dirtiest little secret in town. After he accepts a missing persons inquiry from mysterious DeWitt Allbright (Tom Sizemore, first shady and then downright scary when we see what he's really about), he finds himself searching for a girl named Daphne (Jennifer Beals) a runaway with ties to a very powerful politician (Maury Chaykin makes your skin creep and crawl) with some seriously disturbing extra curricular activities. Rawlins recognizes danger when he sees it and tries to back out, but by then he knows too much and it's way late in the game. Now he must navigate the scene like the pro he to escape not only with answers, but perhaps his life. Washington gives him the underdog treatment, a worn out gumshoe who still has some grit left, enough for one last ride in any case. There's an L.A. Confidential type feel to the plot in the sense that it ducks some conventions in order to service true surprise from its audience. Sizemore is a charming viper as the kind of dude you never want to trust (isn't he just the best at playing that?) and Beals subverts the damsel in distress archetype by injecting her performance with a jolt of poison. In terms of L.A. noir this baby is fairly overlooked, but holds its own to this day. Watch for Don Cheadle as well."

Kids (1995),"There are two highly, and deservedly, controversial movies dealing with the issues of drug and alcohol abuse, underage sex, lack of control, and the preteen and teenage minority of urban America. One of them is ""Kids"" and the other is ""Bully."" The former is a haunting work of art; the latter is a clunk of garbage. Both were directed by the same man, Larry Clark. I saw ""Bully"" first about a year ago and I was blown out of my mind by how offensive and atrociously cruel that movie was and how it redeemed itself in no way. I initially condemned Mr. Clark as a director and vowed never to see another movie of his again.

Then I happened to see the Siskel & Ebert review for his first movie ""Kids"" and after much deliberation, decided to give this controversial filmmaker a second chance. I am so glad that I did.

In many respects, ""Kids"" and ""Bully"" are much the same movie. They're both frighteningly brutal, appalling in their explicit content and vulgar dialogue, and they expose the nasty undercurrents in the younger generations of today, especially in urban cities where parental control (or control of any kind) seems all but present. So why is ""Kids"" a great movie and ""Bully"" an awful one? Because while ""Bully"" only pretended to have a purpose, ""Kids"" *has* a purpose and it never once dumbs down on that. It's a sick and disgusting picture, but it's also somewhat of a wake-up call. And I can fairly say now that as a reviewer and film-goer, I can forgive Mr. Clark.

""Kids"" is set in the drug-riddled streets of New York. We see very little of parents, or adults for that matter, and focus on a group of rambunctious, vulgarity-spitting, lecherous teenagers who are devoted to getting drunk, abusing drugs, and giving away their virginity. The most sickening of them is Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick). Not because he can charm young girls enough to seduce them into deflowering them, but because he's simultaneously signing their death warrants with the HIV virus. One of his victims (Chloe Sevigny) discovers she has AIDS because of her one-night stand with him and as she slowly suffers, searches the city to confront him. Meanwhile, Telly is trying to seduce his next victim while he and a group of other nasty individuals roam unsupervised through a place as horrific as any drug underworld. More shocking is that this is just a day in the life for them.

Even more shocking is the daunting realization that this is one hundred percent accurate and we must commend Mr. Clark and screenwriter Harmony Korine, the latter in particular. His screenplay is the core of why this picture is so powerful. He writes his dialogue without any apparent flow or structure, as if the behavior of his characters are not even up to him. The actions of the characters are unpredictable, as they would be. I also really commend him for his choice to not close up with an obligating-style ending, but to choose a really haunting, crusher of one instead. And Mr. Clark shoots his film in a strong, visual-focused documentary approach with long takes from his camera swinging back and forth between the gossiping teenagers. He also pays good attention to their surroundings, showing the conditions and lack of concern from their peers and elders that resulted in their being this way. Because he has a screenplay that is focused and sharp (""Bully"" did not) his movie has a purpose and even his seemingly pornographic shots have a purpose as well.

The content is oftentimes appalling, but it also has a purpose. This time I must appreciate Mr. Clark's boldness and reluctance to be contrived. Whereas I got the sense he was indulging the drug use and sex in ""Bully,"" here he clearly defines his intentions of turning our stomachs. These particular kids are scum and they are a product of their scummy environment. He wants to show us that. So the scenes of underage sex are jaw-dropping. They do not turn on the audience; they appall. Furthermore, he does not flood the screen with images of naked teenage bodies and relies on our imagination at crucial moments to exploit the real horror. He balances the explicit and implicit with professional craftsmanship.

""Kids"" is a very tough movie to watch and tough to enjoy, but I must confess that it is, to my mind, a truly great film. As I sat there watching it, I was appalled and disgusting and flabbergasted, but at the same time, I was drawn in. Mr. Clark's brilliant portrait of the bad side of humanity in our younger generation grips you by the throat and he never lets go. Not once. He's also got some very strong performances from his cast which include Leo Fitzpatrick, a very young Rosario Dawson, Chloe Sevingy, and the late Justin Pierce whose brilliant performance reminds me so much of the scumbags that I had the displeasure to know in my adolescent years. I personally managed to avoid their paths of life and now looking at ""Kids,"" I am even more thankful that I did."
Mute Witness (1994),"At first this movie really had my full attention. I'm not saying this was an original movie, like I had never seen before, but it sure had something to offer that really appealed to me. It's a pity that it all went wrong in the second half of the movie.

Billy Hughes is a mute make-up artist who works on an American slasher movie that's being shot in Moscow. One fine evening she witnesses the making of a snuff movie in the studio where her crew works. Now she has to try to escape from the murderers (Russian people who work in her film crew), to stay alive and to convince the authorities that the murder that she witnessed is real.

I like to watch good thrillers and I'm a fan of European movies, because most of the time they pay more attention to the character development and the story. Even though this movie sometimes reminds me of a Hitchcock movie and even though it has a European cast and director, it can't convince me all that much. It has some good potential, but somehow they have messed it up and made it look like a mediocre Hollywood movie. The story is quite original, the locations are nice, but it is the acting that doesn't always do the trick. I'm not saying the actors are bad, but they aren't great either. I guess there are people who really love this movie, but I'm certainly not one of them. I give it a 5/10."
"Prophecy, The (1995)","THE PROPHECY, the first in a series of films about fallen angels warring on Earth, is a hoot. It features some truly zany scenes, usually involving 'good' angel Eric Stoltz fighting against the forces of evil, and a stand-out performance from Christopher Walken who toplines as the angel Gabriel.

Walken is one weird guy, and he's never been weirder than in this film. Writer/director Gregory Widen gives Walken some great dialogue to play with, which adds immeasurably to the fun. The storyline is all over the place really, mixing in some police procedural stuff with De Niro-lookalike cop Elias Koteas, a cameo for Lucifer himself (Viggo Mortensen, raising his profile) and a superfluous appearance for CANDYMAN's Virginia Madsen.

Despite the film's sometimes slightly aimless feel, for the most part it works. The storyline is punctuated by moments of creepiness and graphic violence and for the most part it feels fresh and original. In fact, it did so well that sequels followed..."
Something to Talk About (1995),"Julia Roberts (Notting Hill, Runaway Bride) plays Grace Bichon, a working woman who works for her dad and keeps leaving her only daughter behind every place she goes. The casting by Marion Dougherty is brilliant. Mother/Julia Roberts; daughter /Brett Cullen; and sister/Kyra Sedgwick have the same speech pattern and same lips! There is something about their mouths that makes them really match. The cast is full of pros: Dennis Quaid (The League), Gena Rowlands (Hope Floats), and one of my favorites Robert Duvall (Wrestling Ernest Hemingway, The Apostle). He is of the top actors of the American Cinema, Oscar winner and many times nominated for all the prestigious awards available.Two treasures! Dennis Quaid and Robert Duvall. They can surely transform themselves! Eddie Bichon, played by Dennis Quaid, is cheating in his wife and she raises an uproar. She gets the entire family, friends and town are all involved, and Grace makes a point of going out of her way to spread the news of who is cheating and with whom. The movie gets funny as Grace takes vengeance at her own hands including giving Eddie a near death experience with her special chemistry in cooking helped by a special recipe from her Aunt. Kyra Sedwick (Singles, Phenomenon) has so many funny lines. She is my favorite character in this movie. Kyra Sedwick was nominated for Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture for this part. I think that those supporting roles are really good and many times the actor can explore his or her craft more than the actor who has the lead. I have the tape and enjoy watching it. I love: the customs, the stable, horses, and equine competition atmosphere in the movie.

My favorite line: ""Sometimes a near death experience helps to keep things in perspective"" Emma Rae is in bed almost falling asleep: Grace ""Are you up?"". Emma Rae: "" Not technically!"" My favorite Scene: Emma Rae kicking her brother -in -law after she helped him to come in the second floor of the house through the window. Nice looking movie! Good for the eyes! Full of fine lines!"
Three Wishes (1995),"This movie is better than the rating suggests. Patrick Swayze displays some tremendous acting skills as the ever blue Jack McCloud, a tramp and thorough loner. He is sincere and pervasive, as is Joseph Mazzello as Tom. The evolving relationship between the two of them is one of the three major themes of the movie. It is a relationship propelled by Tom's dear wish to have some male person around he can relate to and rely on, as his father is apparently absent. Jack, who joins the family as a stranger, develops a kind of deep and caring commitment towards the three family members. He doesn't push for it, it just happens. The second theme focuses around M.E. Mastrantonio's brilliant performance as Jeanne Holman, Tom's and Gunny's mom. Her despair mingled with hope and confidence makes her the archetype of the single parent of the Mid-50s, the era which is so superbly revived as the movie's setting. The third theme centers around Gunny, Tom's little brother, his belief in magic and fairies as well as his fears. This is the movie's underlying main theme, as the title itself suggests. The end, which makes you feel good and renews faith in what we have and ought to preserve and care for, reveals the message of the title and grants this movie an inspiring and deeply human message. Magic is out there - in everything we do and everything we dream of. It is the little things, the little signs of love and affection, of hope and endurance. Tom himself, as an adult, receives reassurance in his faith and his values by what Jack has done to his family when he was a young boy. The message is brilliant and makes this movie a solid 8/10. ""Be yourself"", Jack advises Tom. ""And be happy with what you have"" he adds much later in the movie. Hope and love will endure against all odds, if we allow magic into our lives. The same magic we believed in as kids. It is still there. You just have to admit it."
Castle Freak (1995),"John (Jeffrey Combs) and Susan Reilly (Barbara Crampton) are a married couple going through some very dark times. She blames him for the fatal car crash that blinded their teen aged daughter Rebecca (Jessica Dollarhide) and killed their younger child J.J. (Alessandro Sebastian Satta). Now, years later, John learns that he has inherited a 12th century Italian castle. They come to do some inventory (John really just wants to sell the place) and do a little exploring. What they discover is that the castle also comes with a secret: a monster, Giorgio (Jonathan Fuller) residing in the lower levels.

What gives ""Castle Freak"" an edge over similar horror product is the overwhelming feeling of tragedy. A pall hangs over this whole film; one has to wonder if this family is ever going to be happy again. Giorgio, too, comes with his own desperately unhappy back story. As is the case with many a movie monster, he's quite pitiable as well as hideous. Fuller is excellent in the role. As often as he creeps you out, he earns your sympathies.

While Combs does tend to get his due as a truly talented actor, this viewer would have to point to ""Castle Freak"" as a solid example of just how good Crampton is as an actress. She's more than just a pretty face. The dramatic tension between John and Susan is palpable. Dollarhide, too, is very good, delivering a sensitive and vulnerable performance. It's somewhat wearying that Susan keeps automatically dismissing Rebeccas' insistence of the other presence in the castle. Stubborn characters can be hard to deal with in this or any other genre.

Director Stuart Gordon and his largely Italian crew create vivid atmosphere. They mostly try to avoid bright colours. In fact, this is one of those instances where it feels like the filmmakers tried to create a slightly colourized version of a black & white movie. The makeup effects by Optic Nerve are impressive, and Richard Bands' music is excellent.

""Castle Freak"" definitely deserves a wider audience. It's a serious, somber story where one does get emotionally invested in these characters.

Inspired by, rather than officially based on, the H.P. Lovecraft tale ""The Outsider"".

Seven out of 10."
Don Juan DeMarco (1995),"DON JUAN DEMARCO lives in the comedy section at my local Blockbuster. I suppose that is the best place for it; it does not suffer under the weight of its psychiatric-evaluation plot device, is exultant and exhilarating, and includes some truly laugh out loud funny lines.

For the most part, though, DJDM is a romantic fable with lessons not just for men (about how to seduce a woman touching nothing but her hand, for example), but for women as well (about how romance can exist in our everyday lives, even if we never encounter Don Juan).

Johnny Depp plays Don Juan DeMarco, the world's greatest lover - a 21 year old man in Queens, NY when we meet him. He has nothing left to live for and climbs to the top of a billboard to await a worthy adversary who will end

his life. Instead, he gets a somnambulistic psychiatrist on the verge of retirement (Marlon Brando), who convinces him to come down and promptly commits him for observation.

In tone, the film is similar to CHOCOLAT (which also stats Depp) and LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE; its environment of a psychiatric hospital where the young Don Juan must prove his sanity reminds me of the grandfather in A PRINCESS BRIDE. It gives us a point of reference in our own world and prevents the unbridled romanticism of Don Juan's monologues from getting out of hand.

No man other than Depp could sit squarely in this modern-world fishbowl and deliver the lines of Don Juan. He insisted on working with Brando on the film, but he outshines the cinema icon in every shared shot. His physical beauty is less important than his utter sincerity - a sincerity so convincing that even my ""I hate chick flicks"" husband can watch with a straight face and come away in a better mood.

As Don Juan says, ""there are only four questions of value in life: What is sacred? Of what is the spirit made? What is worth living for? What is worth dying for?"" By the end of the film, he has proven his point: ""the answer to each is the same - only love."" Not that the story answers all of its own questions...

Is Don Juan a pathological liar and a schizophrenic? Is he troubled but sincere? Does Brando's Dr. Mickler really get conflicting evidence from Don Juan's family, or has he slipped into a daydream fueled by his desire to recapture the part of himself Don Juan represents? No matter how many times I see the film, I end up believing *in* Don Juan, even if I do not *believe* him.

DJDM gets a 7 in spite of being one of my favorite films. The reason: Brando can be nearly intolerable at times, but Depp picks up his slack. Highly recommended to romantics of all ages - one of the sexiest movies in my collection, despite its PG rating."
Dumb & Dumber (1994),"It's hard to find a Farrley's Brother which isn't funny, and this is even harder to classify as, 'not funny'...because it is the funniest!

Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels team up as the not just odd, but strange, weird and mentally disabled couple.

After losing both of their jobs on the same day, Lloyd (Carrey), who retrieved a bag which a woman he drove to the airport leaves in the terminal, encourages his friend Harry to come with him to Aspen where the girl flew to. They think that the gas company is after them since they didn't pay their bill, but is actually the kidnappers of Mary (Holly)'s husband, who were supposed to pick up the money where she left it in the airport terminal.

From their start in Rhode Island, until they arrive in Aspen, the kidnappers follow Harry (Daniels)and Lloyd, along the road. The script is the most well-written comedy I think ever, because every thing that they do in the movie, leads to something new and funny that ends up happening to them later on.

Their are more than a few funny scenes, and the dialogue is always right-on.

I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Farrley Brothers' movies, or anyone who likes Jim Carrey. It's a hilarious comedy and the two stars were perfectly casted, especially Jim Carrey, of course.

And now, an excerpt from the film,

""Skies, huh?"" ""That's right."" ""They yers?"" ""Yup."" ""Both of them?"""
French Kiss (1995),"Kate (Meg Ryan) is a careful history teacher in Toronto and deadly fearful of flying. Her fiancé Charlie (Timothy Hutton) is going to Paris and she won't go with him. She's waiting for her Canadian citizenship. Kate has created lots of plans like buying a house and Charlie is uncertain. Then he drunkenly calls about falling in love with French goddess Juliette. She nervously flies and then bombastic French thief Luc Teyssier (Kevin Kline) sits next to her. He takes her mind off of flying. He hides a stolen necklace and smuggled grape vine in her bag to go through customs. His friend Inspector Jean-Paul Cardon (Jean Reno) insists on giving him a ride. She goes to ambush Charlie at his hotel. Her bag is stolen when she faints after seeing Charlie kissing Juliette.

A flustered Meg Ryan is fun. A fake French Kevin Kline is not. The fake French accent gets annoying. She has a short haircut and her character at the start doesn't fit. Their chemistry is not quite right but it is still Meg Ryan with Kevin Kline. They are apart too much but they have some fun moments together. Meg Ryan maintains her adorable quotient with a bit too much wackiness. The humor is a bit too broad. I don't know how to feel about Ryan saying she will triumph while in front of the Arch de Triumph. It is certainly not subtle but it's not actually smart. The slapstick is broad and sometimes funny."
Little Odessa (1994),"According to the IMDb, James Gray's grandparents were ""Russian immigrants."" This movie was his vision and I strongly disagree with his warped view of immigrants. Years ago when I was in a wealthy suburban town far from Brighton Beach, I was asked whether I saw the film. I was also asked whether I was ever involved in the Russian mafia. I answered ""no"" to both questions. It was true I had never seen the film, nor had I ever been involved with Russian organized crime. I was a first-generation American, who because of my parents and grandparents was able to speak Russian, and my family's hopes of achieving the ""American Dream"" rested firmly on my shoulders. The man who had asked me these questions was an accomplished educator, who had even once been invited to the Oval Office. He was always borderline derisive of me and I felt that he had seen me as a stereotypical ""Russian mobster in the making."" It was years later when I finally watched the film and I was fuming. I want to convey several issues to Americans about this film. The most important issue is that crime exists everywhere, but Brighton Beach is not controlled by the Russian Mafia. There is barely any presence of Russian organized crime, and most residents have vaguely heard or interacted with these elements. The protagonist of the film, a Russian Jewish hit-man who fled Brighton Beach to evade the ire of the Russian Mafia, was a plot-driven character who did not even slightly resemble any of the young immigrants who arrived to Brighton Beach during the 1970's and 1980's. Joshua Shapira was as realistic as Peter Pan. Second, the elderly generation was poorly portrayed in this film. It was filmed in 1993 and Jacob's 80-year-old grandmother was James Gray's idea of an ""off-the-boat"" immigrant. I almost laughed at how the grandmother only spoke Yiddish and was an ""old world"" zombie. That is absolute nonsense. It is true that that generation could speak Yiddish, but they in fact spoke Russian much more frequently and were quite cognizant of history, politics, and current events. That generation, my grandparents, attended English courses for immigrants and were able to converse in basic English. I will admit that not all could do this. Some still had to work, while others had to babysit their grandchildren. My point is that the grandmother in this film, an ""Old World"" Yiddish-only zombie, was not in any way, shape, or form similar to the grandparents of the Soviet Jewish immigration. My grandfather, who recently passed away, spoke Yiddish, Russian, and rudimentary English (because he worked in this country for many years). He also was always mindful of American and world politics. The portrayal of grandparents in this movie was ridiculous and unrealistic. For example, on my way to the Brighton Beach library I remember overhearing two World War 2 generation Soviet immigrants discussing Hillary Clinton's first international tour as Secretary of State in 2009. The baby boomers, who are grandparents today on Brighton Beach, can speak English proficiently and are quite Americanized. Third, the mother suffering from cancer at home and implicitly unable to get medical care because she is an immigrant is absurd. The United States fully provided medical care and support to the underprivileged. If the Shapiro family were in fact as poor as the family portrays, she would had been able to receive Medicaid/Medicare benefits and the government would have paid for her treatments. It was a sinister exaggeration that the poor immigrant suffering from cancer had to die at home and implicitly the reason was because of her ""impoverished immigrant status."" Absolutely bogus. She would have been provided full medical benefits and not suffer at home like portrayed in the film. Fourth, the father in the film was the stereotypical ""Soviet dictator"" parent who was domineering, abusive, and emotionless. The character was just a plot-driven element of the film not remotely similar to any of the Soviet Jewish immigrants who had supported their children, who were either born in the USA or arrived as young children. He was clearly the antagonist of the film, and when the accomplished educator I had mentioned earlier spoke to me about Brighton Beach, I distinctly remember him asking what my father was like. I can assure you that 99% of the Soviet Jewish parents were not Stalin-like brutes. They, in fact, were completely supportive because they wanted their kids to be successful Americans. The father in this film, who dressed like they did at the turn of the century and not the 1990's and stood on Brighton Beach at night with others drinking Vodka with prostitutes, was nowhere close to any reasonable behavior or individual I have encountered on Brighton Beach. The father was an absurd character created by a warped view of what a Soviet immigrant patriarch would be like. I won't spoil the ending for those who haven't seen it, but as the entire movie suggests Brighton Beach is a dark world full of crime, sadness, and tragedy. False. False. False. New Yorkers from all five boroughs travel to the beach and boardwalk during the warmer months, and Brighton Beach is full of restaurants, Sushi bars, and Russian nightclubs. I cannot explain to you how ridiculous it was when Joshua in the end sat in his car alone thinking about all the tragic events during the film. Even when this was filmed in 1993, the movie was a terrible and inaccurate portrayal of Brighton Beach and the Soviet Jewish immigrants who inhabit it. I can tell you that the Soviet Jewish immigrants who arrived when they were young and first-generation Americans who were born here did not live in ""Little Odessa"" and were not inclined to a life of crime. Education, hard work, and successful careers are the attributes of those who inhabit Brighton Beach and this movie was complete fiction in its portrayal of the older immigrants, younger immigrants, and first-generation Americans."
Milk Money (1994),"Three near pubescent boys Brad (Adam LaVorgna), Frank (Michael Patrick Carter) and Kevin (Brian Christopher) decide to satisfy their burgeoning curiosity of the opposite sex by pooling their money together and buying a prostitute to see naked. Their ill advised venture to the city leads them into danger almost immediately until they are saved by hooker named 'V' (Melanie Griffith) and the boys convince her to accept their transaction. V gives the boys a lift home after their bikes are stolen using her pimp's car. When the car breaks down Frank offers to let V live in his treehouse until it's fixed hoping to set her up with his widowed father, Tom (Ed Harris), a science teacher engaged in a fight to save the local wetlands. When V's pimp turns up dead as a result of money stolen from his boss Waltzer (Malcolm McDowell) V's big city life clashes with the uptight suburbia in which she's taken refuge.

Released in 1994, the initial sale of the screenplay by John Mattson was considered such a hot commodity that Paramount paid $1.1 million for the script leading to a lawsuit against Mattson for violation of a verbal agreement with the Dino De Laurentis. When the movie was released the film was a bomb released in the late August dumping ground not even recouping its $20 million budget and made multiple critics ""Worst of '94"" lists including Siskel and Ebert (with Ebert's newspaper review not even being a review but a satirical conversation between two fictitious executives who greenlit the movie). All these years later and the movie is still as awful as it was when first released.

The movie is multiple movie really, it's a coming of age story about boys discovering their sexuality, it's a romantic comedy, it's a crime comedy, and it's a Home Alone style kid shenanigans movie all rolled into one, and surprise surprise it doesn't do ANY of those elements well.

The movie's kid characters are written like gimmicky TGIF sitcom characters with each one being an exaggerated ""Type"". Brad is the ""cool"" one with his preening looks, leather jacket, and combed hair that seems like it's trying to evoke the antiquated image of James Dean, Kevin is an uptight neurotic neatfreak, and Frank is a mixture of a wisecracker and an innocent. Frank is massively inconsistent in the movie being a pranking schemer when the script calls for it, and being cloyingly ""cute"" when the situation calls for it. None of these kids act like real kids and they exist more as excuses for lame jokes are idiotic decisions to move the plot forward. One point of massive stupidity happens early on in the film where the kids travel to ""The City""(never identified by name) and start asking random women if they're prostitutes, when this fails a scuzzy man in a trenchcoat who sees the boys flashing the cash around is able to convince them to come with him to a secluded alleyway because if our characters had a pair of braincells between them there wouldn't be a movie. Even in the impetus for the boys' excursion to find a prostitute to see naked seems rather pointless because we see the boys have access to pornographic VHS tapes and magazines and there's really no rhyme or reason as to why they're doing this.

Things don't improve when V enters the picture, V is the textbook manic pixie dream girl fantasy to a ""T"" with her presence in the film feeling tinkerbellish against the Norman Rockwell by way of Andy Griffith town of Middleton that's so painfully scrubbed clean it makes Main Street USA look like Cabrini Green. The movie has this quasi 50s attitude with its quaint small town that wouldn't feel too far removed from a 50s sitcom like Father Knows Best. Everything about this town from the social attitudes to the behavior of the citizens feels like it's several decades removed from present day. V colliding with suburbia is a large part of the humor in this movie and it feels so artificial and phony because no one acts like a human being. The characters aren't so much characters as they are broad stereotypes and caricatures who are basically there to give one note reactions and overdone catchphrases as ""Jokes"", one scene repeats the dialogue ""That is Bad. That is Very. Very. Bad"" 3 times over the course of five minutes. Even the ""meet cute"" between Frank's father, Tom and V is such a hackneyed misunderstanding filled with unintentional double meanings with a sexual slant that it just makes you cringe watching it. I didn't laugh once at this movie, and more often than not I was groaning, cringing, or some combination of both. Scenes like where V has the boy's lift their shirts over their heads to see if they're ""not harry enough to be dangerous"" or the scene where they go to V's apartment to see her topless are just so unintentionally creepy and their sitcom presentation coupled with very bouncy shenanigans music only makes them worse.

When I was watching this film, I repeatedly asked myself ""Who was this made for?"" with all the sexual themes, innuendos, and a character who's a hooker it's way too outside of acceptable for a general family orientated comedy, but other scenes with kid shenanigans where they talk about farts, barf, or mistake feminine care items for weapons (yes, seriously) play to such a young audience that even Nickelodeon would see these jokes as beneath them. There's also a subplot with Tom trying to save some wetlands and I have no earthly idea why it's in the movie, it's barely a footnote all things considered and the movie doesn't establish anything about them other than they're important to Tom. The movie is basically Pretty Woman by way of a car crash with one of Chris Columbus' family dramedies and they just don't mesh well. Pretty Woman even though there's certainly a Cinderella type fantasy element to the story had a level of credibility to it because it was willing to look at the seamier side of its subject matter (The attempted rape by Jason Alexander's character is still a really well done scene). Chris Columbus movies aren't designed to tackle these kinds of issues and the fact they've built a movie tonally similar to Mrs. Doubtfire around a subject matter like this just shows a complete lack of awareness.

Milk Money is just junk. It's an ill advised attempt to take two popular film tends (Pretty Woman and Chris Columbus movies) and try to mix them together and we're given a mess. The movie doesn't work as a comedy because it tackles a taboo subject mater with a bubbly airheaded delivery more appropriate for a family sitcom, it doesn't work as a romantic comedy because it has dumb characters acting out an unbelievable premise, and it doesn't work as a coming of age story because there's no attempt at actually understanding a child discovering their sexuality and it's instead used as a lame excuse for catch phrases and awkward humor. It's a movie that alternates between tired jokes and cringe inducing situations and is easily one of the worst mainstream films of the 90s."
Swimming with Sharks (1995),"SKIP! TERRIBLE UNBELIEVABLE STORY, EVERYONE IS STUPID AND FOOLED BY A YOUNG NEW HIRE! PATHETIC!

We are to believe that in a blink of an eye, a young (not too attractive) intern is capable of manipulating everyone and the ice-queen boss.

The only one who isn't a fool is the old patriarch.

Pace wayyyy too fast not in a dynamic way but just unbelievable way.

Cliches and stereotypes gallore.

I can't believe this was made in 2022!

*** SPOILERS FROM NOW ON *** Manipulating everyone to the point where she donates her eggs to get her boss pregnant, have sex with her boss, her boss's husband and more...while killing an employer to take his place, poison a dog to eliminate another employer...all this in a blink of an eye.

The old patriarch wasn't fooled but that got him killed.

SKIP!"
Tommy Boy (1995),"Tommy Callahan III (Chris Farley) is a dumb good-natured klutz who finally graduates college after seven years. His father Big Tom Callahan (Brian Dennehy) owns a family auto parts empire in Sandusky, Ohio but it's not going well. Nevertheless, Big Tom is taking out new loans to start up a new brake pad factory and marrying Beverly (Bo Derek). Beverly's son Paul (Rob Lowe) is a jerk. Big Tom puts resentful Richard Hayden (David Spade) in charge of looking after Tommy. Tommy reconnects with former schoolmate and shipping manager Michelle Brock (Julie Warner). When Big Tom dies, the bank reneges on the promise loan until Tommy puts everything he owns on the line. Tommy goes on the road to sell brake pads with a reluctant Richard Hayden.

Chris Farley is naturally adorable and a great physical comic. He exudes charm. David Spade is his perfect partner with his sarcastic superior manner. The movie excels when the duo is on the screen together. It doesn't work quite as well without both guys together. They are simply a hilarious team."
"Baby-Sitters Club, The (1995)","The BSC movie wasn't all bad, but it could have been better. I didn't like the casting choices at all. None of the actresses (and actors) in this movie match the description of their characters in the books. However, the cast of the video series is more faithful to the books.

The movie, while fun, is very stockish and predictable. There isn't much focus on the kids, either! Sure, we get a glimpse of a child here and there (Jackie Rodowsky is no where near a Walking Disaster in the film), but the primary plot centers on Kristy Thomas.

It's too bad that the character of Jessi was horribly underwritten. I'd hate to think that the screenwriter deliberately reduced her to token black person status, but that's pretty much the way Jessi comes across in the film. She only has a few lines to say, and most of them are pretty stupid.

The only performances I did enjoy were those of Elizabeth and Watson (Kristy's mother and stepfather).

All in all, viewers who are just looking for some mindless entertainment might get some enjoyment out of this film. However, fans of the BSC books and videos would probably be disappointed unless they aren't looking for a faithful adaptation."
Bullets Over Broadway (1994),"There was period in the early '90s where Chazz Palminteri was on a roll.. He emerged as a ""name"" actor and was really entertaining and even likable as a killer, as in ""A Bronx Tale."" This movie, ""Bullets Over Broadway,"" was another example of him looking good. Palminteri, as ""Cheech,"" was great to watch in this film.

Unfortunately, his other two costars were not entertaining, especially John Cusack, as playwright ""David Shayne."" Cusack's character shouted, ranted and raved throughout his scenes. Yeah, I know he is supposed to deliberately overact, but that still doesn't make it fun to hear. His hysterics really begin to grate on you after awhile and especially if you watch this movie twice, which I did.

I liked the story and Palminteri, and could put up with Jennifer Tilley's deliberately-stupid bimbo character ""Olive Neal,"" but ""Shayne"" finally did me in. His character ruined the movie forever."
Richie Rich (1994),"While 1994 was a great year to be Green Day or The Offspring, this was not so for the young Macaulay Culkin and his fans. As a 14 year old playing the younger 12 year ""richest kid in the world"", Culkin and his management must have realized quickly that he could not stay a child actor forever. Richie Rich, therefore became Culkin's last major project until his return to film as a 23-year-old young adult in 2003's Party Monster.

In ""Rich"", no actor is in top form. The laughs were too few and too far between, especially for a family comedy. The post-Jurassic Park CGI ""robot bee"" may have even been a hindrance rather than a creative flourish. None of the characters were developed beyond the simple caricatures we'd expect and further stripped of comedic potential. By the time the antagonist breaks into the vault, anyone over the age of 17 probably knew what was inside; that is if they hadn't already stopped paying attention and fallen asleep.

Had the film starred another adolescent lead, we may have been forgiving, but the overall quality of this venture paled in comparison with the Culkin we knew from Uncle Buck, the Home Alone pictures, My Girl, and even his brief appearance in Michael Jackson's 9 minute ""Black or White"" rampage. Being that it was filmed in and around the Chicagoland area, and that this reviewer is a sucker for anything local, this reviewer feels generous giving Richie Rich 4 out of 10 IMDb stars."
Speechless (1994),"I'm glad the writers of this movie were NOT speechless! Politics does make strange bedfellows, but this film was written well enough that it didn't require bed scenes for it to be entertaining to adults and proves that love can be a funny thing.

The very witty banter between Keaton's and Davis' characters is lively and thoroughly enjoyable. Their chemistry is wonderful and believable. The storyline is credible, too. It probably doesn't happen often inside opposite political camps but, just as Carville and Matlin are living examples that relationships can survive working for opposing party candidates, you'll savor watching the film's characters discover that love is the most important party.

I voted SPEECHLESS an ""8""  it's one you'll enjoying recalling again and again."
Timecop (1994),"I only made it through the first few minutes, for good reasons.

At the beginning, there's a meeting where the guy says it's impossible to go forward in time because it hasn't happened yet - not true - hasn't he heard of Eintstein's theory of relativity? He then says you can go back in time 'because it's already happened' (which isn't an explanation of anything) - furthermore, backwards time travel is as doubtful now in 2008 as it was in 1994 when the film was made. Then he contradicts himself by claiming someone jumped forward in time to buy arms with gold bullion.

He says the age of the gold bullion was determined by carbon dating. Firstly if something jumped forward in time, then the process of carbon isotope decay would be skipped. Secondly, there isn't an awful lot of carbon in gold! I am willing to suspend belief when I watch science fiction, but it needs to come up with an explanation that is just a little bit plausible or keep it pure fantasy and miss out so-called scientific explanations. If the writer can't be bothered to do some basic research, then I'm not interested in anything else this idiot has to say."
Hard Target (1993),"Hard Target (1993) is one of the greatest and the best action packed movie in a John Woo-Van-Damme Style! Of all Van Damme movies this one of his, is the best of Van Damme ever and I absolutely love it to death. Like the title says Don't hunt what you can't kill. It is my John Woo's number 1 personal favorite action flick of all time, that I love to death. It is also one one of my personal favorite action films of all time.

""Don't hunt what you can't kill.""

The thrill of the hunt. It's the ultimate drug, and the more intense the rush, the higher the price. International superstar Jean-Claude Van Damme teams up with world-famous action director John Woo for this electrifying thriller Van Damme is the target of an evil mercenary (Lance Henriksen) who recruits homeless combat veterans for the ""amusement"" of his clients - bored tycoons who will pay a half a million dollars to stalk and kill the most challenging prey of them all: Man. Laced with dark humor and slam-packed with electrifying action Hard Target is a must see for action fans.

Hard Target is not only my John Woo favorite film, it is also my Jean-Claude Van Damme favorite best action film from my favorite action star. I put this film over Die Hard, this is my Die Hard movie. I love that the stunts were realistic I think that John Woo didn't allow Van Damme to make his own stunts and it is a shame that Jean-Claude Van Damme *beep* up his chance with John Woo by making on another film. It is Van Damme's ego fault. Still they don't make movies like this.

I heard that there is Driector's cut somewhere on DVD that I have never saw, I own this film on Blu-ray in my John Woo collection and I still love it. The stunts are crazy, the action are spectacular. Van Damme catching a snake wow incredible. (at one point, a movie's typical crazy stuntman; firing the Beretta 92FS 9mm while standing on the seat of a motorcycle and crashes in to the car.) Still the motorcycle chase sequence is my favorite scene in the film.

Van Damme ""launches thousands of bullets, slugs, and explosive projectiles into THIRTY of mercenary tycoons baddies."" Arnold Vosloo is also underrated actor who plays Pik van Cleef he did a really pretty good job as the villain and Fouchon second mercenary henchman. Possibly best role for him. ""I don't get angry. I'm a professional."" I love this movie the action is delivered perfectly. Honestly I love Arnold Vosloo more in this movie than Lance Henriksen and I love his character Pik van Cleef.

The trill of the hunt. It's the ultimate drug and the more intense the rush, the higher the price. Hard target was the film is saw as a teen when I was 18, I couldn't saw it as a kid I really don't know, it was never on TV and I have never seen a VHS cover in a video store. I didn't even know that movie exists.

Hard Target is a 1993 action film that marked the US directorial debut of acclaimed Hong Kong director John Woo, who brought out his Asian style of action to Western cinema.

10/10 for me I love this movie to death, It is my number 1 favorite action film."
Heaven & Earth (1993),"Wow, some people live their lives the same way like robots till their death, but this woman lives her life with so many dramas. Same thing is happening in Iraq now, people here in the US are enjoying their lives to the fullest while so many innocent Iraqi people are suffering with no end.

I am surprised that the rating is not too high. The movie ""Deer hunter"" which was also about Vietname war, it was so slow and boring. If it didn't win some Oscars, I would have stopped watching in the middle of it. This movie is about the same feature length, but this one is much more emotional, and not boring at all.

It is another tear-jerking movie. This movie helped me to understand the pain that Vietnamese people suffered during the war. It is very authentic. Those are the common people who just want to make the best out of their lives, they just want to live. It was especially touching when she finally came back to her village, and her brother told her about how he felt throughout the years. She is not a hero, but she is such a brave woman who suffered so much, who almost died. How many of us will ever live a life like hers. In the end, this movie makes all of us to treasure the life that we have now, there are so many people who are living in this world who still don't have the things that we take for granted.

Thank you for all those who worked on this great movie."
Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993),"In Manhattan, Carol (Diane Keaton) and her husband Larry Lipton (Woody Allen) are coming home late night when they meet their next door neighbors Lillian (Lynn Cohen) and Paul House (Jerry Adler) in the elevator. Lillian and Paul invite their neighbors to drink coffee with them in their apartment and Lillian shows her treadmill to Carol and Paul shows his collection of stamps to Larry. While drinking coffee, the elderly couple tells that they have been married for twenty-eight years and they have a twin tomb in the cemetery. Lillian tells that she is in good shape and uses her treadmill everyday.

On the next night, Carol and Larry go to see The Flying Dutchman in the theater and when they come back home, they learn that Lillian has died of heart attack. A couple of days later, Carol and Larry meet Paul on the street and Carol believes he is too perky for a widower that has just lost his beloved wife. When Carol accidentally finds an urn with Lillian's ashes in Paul's kitchen, she suspects that Paul has killed Lillian and comments with her friend Ted (Alan Alda). They decide to investigate her neighbor and Carol steals the keys of Paul's apartment from the super. She finds that Paul will travel to Paris and not to Caribbean as he had told to Larry and she, with a woman called Helen Moss. When Carol sees by chance Lillian alive in a bus, her curiosity increases and she decides to go further in her investigation.

Yesterday I was setting in order and cleaning my films on the shelf, and I decided to see again the VHS ""Manhattan Murder Mystery"". Last time I saw this film was in the 90's and I did not recall the story in details. Woody Allen is one of my favorite directors and actor, and that is the reason why I do not dare to say that this film is one of his best films because I love practically all his filmography.

""Manhattan Murder Mystery"" has mystery, suspense and the refined and witty humor typical from Woody Allen. One of my favorite moments is when Larry compares the need to Carol returning to her shrink with a GM's recall. Another very funny moment is when the clumsy Larry plays the wrong tape during the phone conversation with Paul. If the reader wants to spend 104 minutes laughing, watch ""Manhattan Murder Mystery"" since this film is funny even for those that are not fans of Woody Allen. My vote is eight.

Title (Brazil):""Um Misterioso Assassinato em Manhattan"" (""A Mysterious Murder in Manhattan"")

Note: On 23 October 2020, I saw this film again."
Menace II Society (1993),"The feature debut of the Hughes brothers brings us the story of the life of young people in the Los Angeles ghetto. ""Menace II Society"" focuses on Caine (Tyrin Turner), the son of a drug dealer father and an addict mother, who grows up surrounded by scum and crime, but to which he does not belong in the soul and from which he tries to escape. Unfortunately, too late.

""Menace II Society"" is reminiscent of ""Goodfellas"" in its structure, and in essence a black version of ""American History X"". It's relentless and explicitly brutal, and while it's considered one of the most realistic portrayals of 1990s ghetto life, I think it's still rather over the top. Its main assets are the camera and directing, followed by the good acting of most of the characters. But the script is not its strong point.

For the first hour, the film is on the verge of boring, a mediocre crime drama about life in the ghetto, and only in the last third does it gain weight. But just when you are properly drawn into the story, the experience is spoiled by a couple of unnecessarily melodramatic scenes, without real emotional strength, and if you didn't predict the end at the beginning, it will be crystal clear to you now.

Also, the characters only function as part of the group and their environment, while individually they are two-dimensional and you will not get attached to them and sympathize with them. On top of that, the main character is probably the most uninteresting of them all, even irritating at times.

Although extremely negative, O-Dog is by far the most charismatic character in the film. The debut performance of the eighteen-year-old Tate is simply infectious, but it gives the film a note of propagating violence and crime, which the Hughes brothers did not intend. There's also a young Jada Pinkett, as well as a small but very impressive appearance by Samuel L. Jackson as Caine's father.

All in all, good cinematography and acting, and brutal realism are spoiled by the lack of a well-constructed story and characters that would arouse sincere emotions, and the dramatic ending loses its power because it is obvious from the very beginning.

6,5/10."
Poetic Justice (1993),"I was hoping the main character, played by Janet Jackson, would lead to more adventures, like making a career out of her poetry composing, or befriend a nicer guy than Lucky (Tupac). After her boyfriend is killed at the beginning, Justice dives into despair and writes poems to escape her depression. She is dragged along for an anonymous ride with her friend and her boyfriend plus Lucky, which ends up in nothing but arguments and domestic violence.

Why is Justice hanging out with these people? She could have made it big with her poetry and gotten out of South Central, get her dreams started and move on from her harsh life. Instead nothing really happens except that she and Lucky seem to share the same views on violent social life, which turns out to be boring.

John Singleton seems to put in more bitchy, annoying domestic and social arguments between his characters in this film, Higher Learning, Baby Boy and this film unfortunately lack the deepness of his outstanding directional techniques he used for his first feature film, Boyz In Da Hood. 2fast 2furious and Four Brothers are taken out of the ghetto, but they don't share the rawness and desperation of Boyz. Shaft, on the other hand, is a change to the director's inventory and also shines a few ""behind the camera"" genius sparks he first showed us in his Oscar-nominated film Boyz In Da Hood."
Rising Sun (1993),"Based on Crichton's novel of the same name, 'Rising Sun' is a Time-Pass fare, the doesn't falter as far as quick entertainment is concerned. The Fast-Pacing is spot-on & The Performances work!

'Rising Sun' Synopsis: When a professional escort is found dead, apparently after a violent sexual encounter, Police Detective Web Smith & John Connor, a former police Captain and expert on Japanese affairs, are sent to investigate.

'Rising Sun' is good stuff. It's Entertaining, Progressive & Fast-Paced. The Screenplay by Crichton & Michael Backes, is truly engaging & well-written. Philip Kaufman has Directed the film well. Cinematography is eye-filling. Editing is crisp. Art Design is fair.

Performance-Wise: Sir Sean Connery & Wesley Snipes make superb screen-heroes & share an infectious chemistry throughout. Harvey Keitel is in excellent form. Tia Carrere does her bit well. Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa is effective. Ray Wise is decent. Steve Buscemi is as usual.

On the whole, 'Rising Sun' is Entertaining."
"Shadow, The (1994)","In 1930s New York City, the Shadow (Alec Baldwin) battles his nemesis, Shiwan Khan (John Lone), who is building an atomic bomb out of unstable bronzium and beryllium spheres.

This film gets a bum wrap. While the picture is a great film, it is a decent adaptation of the old radio dramas and serial films (such as ""Behind the Mask""). While audiences of the 1990s may not have been familiar, many of the story elements were taken directly from the radio dramas and pulp novels. Even before Batman, there was the Shadow (with even an inside man on the New York Police Department).

As mentioned, the scenarios in this film come from the old novels and writer David Koepp created more than decent adaptations and his work was done with good intent and absolute reverence. Koepp, a Wisconsin native, is no slouch -- he is the fifth most successful screenwriter of all time in terms of domestic box office receipts, with such films as ""Jurassic Park"", ""Mission Impossible"", and ""Spider-Man"".

Alec Baldwin is surprisingly good in the role of Lamont Cranston -- who could have pictured him a hero? Not long before, he was a scrawny nerd in ""Beetlejuice"". The impressive cast could be singled out one by one -- Jonathan Winters, Tim Curry, Penelope Ann Miller and more... this was quite the ensemble.

Some things did not make a lot of sense, but I think perhaps that was intentional. Or, as Ebert says, ""If the movie is finally just a little less than the sum of its parts, maybe that's appropriate."" Unfortunately, the least coherent part is the beginning (which includes the origin story), and this might lose some viewers before they have decided to even give the movie a chance. And then the rest of the film sort of glosses over the moral conundrum that this millionaire playboy can afford to be a hero because he made his money addicting Tibetans to heroin and opium...

Thanks to Shout Factory, we now have a slick new Blu-Ray disc looking better than ever. Sadly, the features are a bit weak for a special edition. Although they were able to track down the writer, director, cinematographer and two of the three lead actors to create a 23-minute featurette (worth watching), apparently none of these folks was willing to provide a couple hours for commentary.

This is the sort of film that was overlooked in its day (losing revenue to ""The Mask"") and really deserves a sequel, though of course at this point the only option is a remake. If the rumors of Sam Raimi wanting to tackle the project turn out to be true, maybe some day we will see it..."
Andre (1994),"Hi, I'm Camille Bajema reporting for KIDS FIRST! and today I'm reviewing the 1994 film ""Andre,"" based on the book ""A Seal Called Andre"" which is based on a true story. I like this film because I'm an animal lover and this film is filled with animals.

""Andre"" is about a little girl, Toni Whitney, played by Tina Majorina, who lives with her parents Harry and Thalice, played by Shane Meier and Chelsea Field; her sister, Paula, played by Aidan Pendleton; and her brother Steve, played by Keith Carradine. They have an assortment of animals, and decide to adopt an orphaned, baby seal that that they name Andre. Andre lives with the Whitney's for a few years, until a man from the health department shows up and wants to take Andre away!

My favorite character in this film is Toni's mother, Thalice. I like Thalice because she is very loving toward her kids, yet also knows how to discipline them.

My favorite scene in this movie is when Andre learns funny tricks and performs them for people on the pier. I like this scene because Andre is so cute and fun. An interesting fact is that Andre is played by a sea lion, not a seal, in the movie.

""Andre"" is directed by George Miller and produced by Annette Handley. The music in this film sets the mood. The movie is filmed in a beautiful harbor in Rockport, Maine and I especially love the cinematography when the seasons change.

This movie is a tear-jerker and Toni learns that despite how much she loves Andre she may have to let him go. This is a family-friendly movie and I recommend it to people of all ages. I give this film five-out-of- five stars because I thought that the movie was really well-done overall and had a great plot. I am pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed this movie so much because the picture on the cover made me think that it would appeal to a younger audience."
"Celluloid Closet, The (1995)","I watched this movie for the first time in many years on TCM tonight, and really found it to be a first-rate documentary. Yes, some of the people interviewed are more informative than others - Gore Vidal's stories about the creation of *Ben Hur* are perhaps at the top, but others have interesting things to say as well. The range of movies from which the clips were taken is very impressive indeed, and is a tribute to Vito Russo's historical work on the topic, on which this movie was based.

My only objection is that no one and no movie is identified. Yes, they are all listed in the credits at the end. But I really would like to have learned, as I watched it, what movies some of those clips came from, and who some of the interviewees I did not recognize were. Perhaps on the dvd version that omission is rectified?

That notwithstanding, I recommend this movie without reservation for anyone who wants to see how gays and lesbians were portrayed in the first hundred years of American cinema. Yes, I'm sure there is some favorite movie of yours, or movie scene, that is left out. That's inevitable. You can't cover all the movies Russo mentions in one film. Yes, it's unfortunate that there is no sequel to cover Hollywood since 1988, or foreign movies, or tv shows. But those are not faults with what is here, which is very entertaining and informative.

A very well made movie."
One Fine Day (1996),"The headlong screwball comedy of this breakneck romance of two stressed-out single parents is a delight from beginning to end. It has scenes as quick witted - and often as wackily off-kilter! - as the adults must be just in order to survive their average day. Stir love into this mess of two increasingly desparate modern lives and you get a miraculous souffle of a film, at once sharp and sweet.

No scene is laboured, no point is telegraphed, and - phenomenally for a modern American film - neither kids nor kittens are allowed to smother the audience in the nauseous layers of cutesiness that are usually applied. The scene with the analyst, where Clooney must obscure his account of his sex-life in an ever-more-surrealistic periphrasis involving iced cakes and fish, since his little daughter has to accompany him into the presumably crecheless analyst's surgery, and her dad is embarassed to expose her to such adult matters as he is obliged to reveal during the session, is a scene which is a model of intelligent and stylish comedy writing. The dialogue of both himself and his analyst finally founders on the increasingly strained comparisons and metaphors being attempted. The analyst begins to construct an alarmingly kinky lifestyle for his client out of what he takes to be Freudian suggestions - but which are, as noted, merely the product of old-fashioned seemliness - whereupon Clooney is forced to bring the whole towering edifice back down to earth when his version of the morning's business with the goldfish gets mixed up in the heady brew of symbolism: 'No. I mean fish. You know - 'Fish' fish?'

The humour is all good, never strained, and beautifully played by all the principals, including the wonderfully un-sentimentalised children. The transformation, stage-by-stage, of the harsh mutual competition and resentment that exists at first between these harassed adults, into an exhausted truce, by way of barely-restrained irritation, grudging gratitude, reluctant respect, and growing affection, is handled with considerable dramatic finesse throughout.

To produce the unlikely union of such an ill-assorted pair under such utterly unpropitious and unromantic circumstances is a comedic challenge of considerable proportions, and the makers of this film do an excellent job to bring it off at all. The spirits of Grant and Hepburn - even Beatrice and Benedict - are not too far away.

The only disappointment is to see how many people in the audience have gone home just as sour as when they arrived, judging from some of the comments here. But then, love curdles in any mean-spirited breast.

One particularly admires the fact that, at its conclusion, the film's romantic clincher - when the tired-out couple have to settle for just falling asleep together, despite their by now clearly desparate need for each other, - insists upon the importance of exactly this: Love, rather than merely lust, as the basis for an adult relationship.

Just occasionally, Hollywood still lets us have a grown-up entertainment. It makes a pleasant and wholesome change from the usual fare of adolescent dreams."
Girl 6 (1996),"I am a huge Spike Lee fan and like any huge fan I enjoy everything he makes. Watching Spike Lee movies all these years I know what to expect going into a Spike Lee movie. Incredible dialog, incredible acting, messages or even incredible film scores (courtesy of Terence Blanchard). Spike Lee's 1996 effort Girl 6 however is a tough cookie. Upon seeing it for the first time, I was confused. There were a lot of elements in this film that I hadn't seen in any of Spike's films before. The cameos and the attempt to make this a straight forward comedy was some of the things I had never seen Spike do. But I had confidence in him and knew that he'd make this film watchable. Over the years I had been on the fence about this film and couldn't really figured out what I liked about this film. Was it the fact that it was a Spike Lee joint? Was it the incredible Prince soundtrack? So I decided to sit down and analyze the DVD of the film. We meet an actress (Theresa Randle) in the middle of an audition being conducted by Quentin Tarantino. We witness her walking out on the part because of demands and we also see her being dropped by her agent and kicked out of her acting class. Down on her luck, she looks in the classifieds and find phone sex companies looking for new ladies. She takes the job and we see Girl 6 blossom before our eyes. She has her highs and lows in the business but remains an aspiring actress at heart. Complete with fantasy scenes, Prince music, cameos and Spikes trademark shots Girl 6 was an OK comedy at best. Scenes made me cringe (see the Jeffersons/Good Times fantasy sequence), some made me laugh and the ending left me disappointed. I had now come to see what everyone disliked about the movie. But it wasn't as bad as everyone made it seem. Sure its a Spike Lee joint but don't expect it to be on the level of Do The Right Thing, Malcolm X or Bamboozled. Spike lapsed on this one but it still has its moments. 8 years after Girl 6, Spike would suffer the same fate in 2004's She Hate Me. Maybe comedy isn't his thing but Girl 6 (also see his child friendly 1994 film Crooklyn) separated him from the angry and controversial persona that the press made him out to be. Girl 6 is a mixed bag but it is watchable. I honestly can't say that I wouldn't sit down and watch the whole thing again.

Space Jam (1996),"NOTE: This film was recommended to me by Ryan Clevenger for ""Steve Pulaski Sees It.""

Living in Illinois, Space Jam is a film that hits the tender spots of the last two generations; one generation that got to experience Michael Jordan's unfathomable legacy as arguably the greatest basketball player who ever lived, and the other, mine, that reflects on his legacy through highlights and documentaries to keep the memory of such an all-star alive. Jordan's legacy didn't stop at on-court talent, as he was one of the most marketed athletes of his time and helped popularize the NBA, let alone the Chicago Bulls, on a previously unforeseen international level.

If we remove the nostalgia factor from Space Jam, which is a very difficult thing to do by the way, then the film serves as Jordan's versatility. After retiring from the NBA at a relatively young age to pursue a career in baseball, Jordan only became more of a fascinating person, in addition to someone with impeccable charisma. Space Jam exists as a response to Jordan's departure from the NBA to the MLB, as the Looney Tune gang of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Tweety Bird, Sylvester the Cat, Porky Pig, and Lola Bunny all call Jordan out of retirement when they challenge a group of intergalactic invaders from ""Moron Mountain"" to a basketball game in exchange for the planet.

The Looney Tunes thing this will be an easy win, until the aliens from Moron Mountain, who are relatively puny in size and strength, find a way to steal the talents of star basketball players like Charles Barkley and Larry Johnson and become the ""Monstars"" of the court. Meanwhile, Jordan agrees to play for the Looney Tunes team, but it takes all of the five minutes of practice to show that the team is disproportionately talented towards Jordan. As a result, the team indulges in some aggressive training tactics to beat the Monstars and save the planet.

As an amalgamation of live-action and animation, especially in an age where Pixar was coming on the scene and traditional animation was soon to be phased out, Space Jam is bright and vivid. The real-life characters of Michael Jordan, Wayne Knight, who has an amusing role, like he always does, Larry Bird, and even Bill Murray's interactions with the animated characters of Bugs Bunny and the like in a convincing, believable manner. The result is a beautifully colored and nicely executed mix of whimsy.

Because both worlds of reality and animation are explored here, Space Jam has the luxury of being a film that can go beyond traditional boundaries of a sports film, and the Looney Tunes are no better characters to incite such zaniness. The animated bunch are quick-witted and ecstatic, and Jordan is clearly doing this for fun and excitement rather than a phoned-in project or another endorsement. Had Space Jam been more of a lackluster cash-in, sports fans and Jordan fans would've seen it from a mile away and dismissed the film immediately. However, because everyone involved recognizes what a zany project this is, they don't try to fight the lunacy, but instead, play along, and that provides us, the audience, with a wickedly entertaining stride into a lively sports film that is so fun you almost, almost miss the clichéd underdog element.

Starring: Michael Jordan, Wayne Knight, Bill Murray, and Larry Bird. Directed by: Joe Pytka."
Mrs. Winterbourne (1996),"My first bit of confusion was over exactly where this movie wanted to go. I imagined it as a romantic comedy of sorts, and yet from the very beginning it was really quite heavy, dealing as it did with young Connie (Rikki Lake) being homeless, then meeting up with a sleazebag and then being tossed out by him when he gets her pregnant. I really wasn't feeling much fun at that point in the movie. Then mistaken identity turns into deliberate deceit on Connie's part (although I understand it wasn't malicious.) Once she gets taken in by the Winterbourne's after the train wreck that kills their son and his wife (whom the family has never met, and whom Connie is mistaken for) the only character who really made sense to me was Bill (Brendan Fraser), who seemed appropriately suspicious of her given the circumstances. True, he was ridiculously obnoxious, but his suspicion was bang on, except that he then, for no obvious reason that I saw, fell head over heels in love with her, letting go of all his suspicions and deciding to marry her! Where did that come from?

There are some moments of fun in this. Shirley MacLaine (as the matriarch of the Winterbourne clan) was probably the best part of the movie and provided much of the comedy, and the closing scenes (as everyone tries to protect Connie/Patricia) was quite touching, as was the point that the Winterbournes became the family she never had. There was a nice feel to that, especially because we know that Connie isn't out for the family's money, but just wants the sense of family for herself and even more for her son.

There was one huge inconsistency here that just made everything else implausible, though. Bill finally figures out what's going on because he sees ""Patricia"" sign ""Connie Doyle"" on a check, and investigates who Connie Doyle is. He gets back a report that Connie and her unborn baby were killed in the train wreck (it was, of course, the real Patricia and her unborn baby who were killed.) How would he get that report? Connie wasn't supposed to be on that train. She got swept into it by a huge crowd of people, she had no ticket, and since it wasn't really Connie there would be no way of identifying the body as Connie. How then would anyone come to the conclusion that the dead body was Connie when no one knew Connie was on that train - and, in fact, no one on that train even knew Connie?

This isn't an unenjoyable movie. It's quite touching, really - but it does have a lot of flaws! 5/10"
Faces (1968),"John Marley plays a fatted-calf spawn of affluent suburbia, who is tired of his wife (Lyn Carlin) JUST BECAUSE!!..He goes off with Gena Rowlands, who condones infidelity if it is conditionally based on a bond between two people, and not just for purposes of sordid sex..The common ground all of the characters in the movie share is not love nor understanding, but as is often the case... ALCOHOL!!!.. The director, John Cassevetes, is once again superb in his character portrayal of morally inept people who rely on their misguided self-serving interests and callous logic to carry them through their meaningless pursuits.. Before we do anything, let's pour another drink...We act the way the alcohol tells us to act, the convoluted line of logic being "" I can't help what I did and said, the highly toxic cocktails made me act that way"".... These antics are more adolescent than anyone could possibly imagine, yet they go under the guise of sophisticated fun!! Such charades fall into the category of extremely dangerous thrills..both emotionally and physically as well!! A precariously select set of upscale Los Angeles clicks have unearthed an onslaught of social misgivings about themselves which have plummeted them down to a pathetically denigrating conscious pitfall level!! These fragile and ominous emotions inevitably become purulent once these individuals' drunken stupors have punctured them open!! SO NOW!! HUSBAND AND WIFE HAVE PLAYED SWITCHIES!!.. What's next?..For starters, they've been painfully reminded that their lives have been obviated from happiness and even contentment!!.. Self destruction is so ugly it just cannot be ignored!! Nothing works for me, nothing works for my spouse, nothing works for my mistress, nothing works for anybody!!!...Their ultimate undoing is not necessarily the marital infidelity on it's own right, but rather, emotions that are predicated on unscrupulous gratification, and a volatile unwillingness to empathize with anyone or anything!!! John Cassevetes evokes a cynicism in this film that touches the core of non-productive selfishness.. Itemization of the character's unchanging flaws is an aspect of behavior that Cassevetes implements in virtually every one of his films... Cassevetes articulates an introverted disarray with his characters in ""Faces"" by way of manufacturing a set of prevailing circumstances being such whereby the most felonious afflictions with all of the people in the movie are directly attributed to an affluent monotony, as well as an executive class alienation!! The end result of such a fate has fatalistic repercussions!! Cassevetes did not consult with the actors and actresses in this movie, once he assigned them their character roles, he then told them that they now owned these roles and they should treat them accordingly!! The camera angles in ""Faces"" are spectacular as they illustrate the pejorative reactions of perplexing curiosity with virtually everyone in the film!! Cassevetes is brilliant...Usually the debate is how brilliant...I say EXTREMELY BRILLIANT!!!... However!! I am not a professional movie critic!! SORRY ABOUT THAT JOHN!!! A great director does not even consider himself a director, rather, someone who just understands people... This is what I heard anyway!!!... John Cassevetes goes out on a limb by being so overtly non-conventional.. Guess what?...It definitely works!!!! AN UTTERLY OUTSTANDING MOVIE!!"
Mulholland Falls (1996),"This movie needed more Jennifer Connelly, and it needed to be in black and white. I'm sorry, but noir never really works for me unless it's steeped in shadows and a colorless world. That's just what I've been conditioned to expect from a good noir movie. If Mulholland Falls would have been set in the modern day, I think that the color wouldn't have bothered me as much, but the combination of the time period and the style makes the colorization just to much for me to tolerate.

As for Jennifer, she's the crux of the film, but we don't get to spend very much time at all with her. We don't get a sense of who she is and why she did the things that she did, and that greatly lessens the impact of her death. If you don't care about the core of the story, then it's difficult to have any real investment in the rest of the movie.

In all honesty, even if the movie was in black and white and Jennifer Connelly had two times more scenes, this movie would probably still be boring. I just never cared or was interested in what was going on. Michael Madsen was wasted, there wasn't nearly enough of John Malkovich, and Nick Nolte was just smacking people and looking grim. Mulholland Falls gets two stars for Jennifer Connelly's magnificence, but even her wonders barely made it worth watching."
"Arrival, The (1996)","*** 1/2 out of ****

Writer/director David Twohy accomplished the near-impossible in the summer of 1996; he delivered a fun, fast-paced AND intelligent sci-fi thriller with The Arrival, an intriguing, thought-provoking film that was unfairly ignored in theaters at the time of its release (most viewers chose to see Twister, M:I, Independence Day). The movie has a classic premise about a radio astronomer (Charlie Sheen) who receives a signal from outer space that may or may not have come from extraterrestrial life.

To say anymore would be unforgivable, as Twohy packs in believable twists and turns throughout the plot, which is fun without insulting the brain, and complex without ever bogging down in mind-numbing confusion. The script does have a few head-scratchers here and there (I was particularly miffed that Lindsay Crouse's character, an environmentalist, wasn't familiar with the concept of terraforming) and some contrivances, but they're hardly bothersome and aren't noticeable until a second viewing.

As good a screenwriter as Twohy is, he's even more adept as a director (further proven by Pitch Black, a superbly crafted deep-space thriller with a script not even half as smart as The Arrival's). With great pacing and precise editing, Twohy builds momentum with each discovery Sheen unfolds, until it culminates to an edge-of-the-seat climax that's quite satisfying (unlike...cough...cough...""V: the Final Battle"", Independence Day).

The cast is all-around effective, with Sheen delivering a surprisingly terrific performance as the paranoid astronomer. It's great to see an intelligent protagonist who thinks his way out of tight jams, rather than shooting and blowing up everything in sight. No one else gets half of Sheen's screentime, but Ron Silver is nicely ambiguous as his boss, and Teri Polo, however underused, is fine as Sheen's girlfriend. Lindsay Crouse also makes a good impression as an environmentalist studying some strange activity.

On a technical level, some sci-fi fans might be a little disappointed. Those weaned on ""V"" and ID4 will notice the lack of large-scale special effects. Sorry, no disc-shaped motherships here. Still, the visuals present are mostly decent, certainly passable enough that they don't become a distraction to the plot. Despite the use of CGI in its more primitive stages (this was '96, after all) the effects are still occasionally excellent and imaginative, such as the spherical object those tight-lipped men wield. Composer Arthur Kempel's score adds a bit more tension to the already excruciating suspense, and evokes a creepy atmosphere during the film's quieter moments.

Remember, folks, The Arrival is a rarity, a once in a while example of how pure movie magic can be created when we've got dedicated filmmakers who want to intrigue the audience rather than catering to demographics just for the sake of box office returns. Forget Independence Day, The War of the Worlds, or V and its sequel, The Arrival is the most satisfying cinematic depiction of alien invasion to date."
"Phantom, The (1996)","The Phantom originated with a comic strip in 1936. He is a superhero without super powers, surrounded by myths and mysticism. This film preserves the comic strip feel of the original hero, much like the TV series of Batman that featured Adam West. Billy Zane, who portrays The Phamtom, even sounds like Adam West when he talks.

Many of the characters feel like they come from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". The action borders on silliness, as if punches should be accompanied by bubbles saying ""POW!"" or ""BAM!"" a la ""Batman"".

The Phantom is called ""the ghost who walks"", but much of the time he rides his horse called Hero, accompanied by his wolf named Devil. Most of the characters are clichéd caricatures.

The action takes place just before WWII and the non-jungle scenes capture that era effectively. The scenery and the design aspects of the film, including the fashions, are the best part of the film.

Kristy Swanson plays the part of Diana Palmer, love interest to the main character. There is no chemistry between them. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Sala, the bad girl accomplice of the villains-a small part that allows her to shine briefly. Treat Williams plays Xander Drax, the villain, with true comic-strip smarminess and relish.

Had they modernized The Phantom as was done with later Batman films, it might have been more successful. The ""Agent Carter"" TV series is an example of doing it right. This film lacked the humor that might have sold its tongue-in-cheek approach."
Alaska (1996),"If it were only for the splendid and breathtaking scenery i would still recommend this movie. However this film also delivers on the emotional level and follows a journey of transformation as beautiful as the visual aspects.

A single father apts for a change after losing his wife by moving to Alaska with his two children to become a bush pilot. His son is resentful at best, ungrateful, and unappreciative of the vast and stunning riches Alaska has to offer. When their father's plane goes down and rescue efforts fail, they begin a spiritual journey that will forever change their lives. The son, Shawn, played by Vincent Karthieser, soon comes to terms with the death of his mother, the love for his father, and the respect and appreciation for Alaska. Thora Birch, an actress with a promising future, provides the level-headed and sensible approach to the journey in contrast to her brother's cockiness and arrogance which provides for great chemistry between the two.

Along with the natural beauty and landscapes just about every other aspect associated with Alaska is present from: poaching, bushpilots, kayaking, rustic cabins, rock climbing,, moutaineering, camping, and the northern lights along with Cubby, a baby polar bear who tags along and even provides for some tear jerking moments and light hearted humor.

Overall this is a great movie for the entire family or for one with a fascination with the wonders and beauty of the last frontier. It truly evokes a sense of appreciation delivered in a manner without the concept of strong language, violence, and nudity, the three marketing schemes of the industry. It is a fantastic adventure, with great camera angles, stunning visuals and a powerful message. Very well done IMHO."
Escape from L.A. (1996),"Exciting and spectacular rescue into Los Angeles destroyed by earthquakes, floods, mudslides, and become a top-security prison . This thrilling picture results to be an inferior sequel to Escape from N.Y. , the latter become a real Cult Movie . It contains mystery , chills , noisy action , thrills , fights , social critical , bits of humor with tongue-in cheek attitude and a weird atmosphere with dark and surprising ending . Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell, he was the only cast member from the original film to appear in the sequel)is once again called in by the United States government (Stacy Keach as officer , Michele Forbes as deputy and Clift Robertson as President) to recover a potential doomsday device from Los Angeles, now an autonomous island where undesirables are deported and finds itself under siege by violent gangs . A previous war hero named Snake Plissken gone rebel must execute a daring adventure and bring up a powerful artifact in twenty four hours . Snake must recover it and along the way facing off villains like Cuervo Jones (George Corraface) . He's only helped by a sympathetic rogue underling (Steve Buscemi who took the part in this film to help fund his directorial debut, Trees Lounge) , and action women (Valeria Golino, Pam Grier) . As Snake Plissken to get in and out of Los Angeles .

The film is a comic book plenty of action , fun , adventures , suspense , thriller and surprise-filled entertainment . Magnificent plethora of characters with decent performances by its entire cast . Middle-budget by Paramount Pictures , in fact its President Sherry Lansing was a fan of ""Escape from New York"" and wanted John Carpenter, Kurt Russell and Debra Hill to make the sequel in the same vein as the original. Kurt Russell as tough and valiant renegade is terrific . At the beginning of the film, Kurt Russell wears his costume from the original film, which still fits after 15 years . Kurt Russell not only came up with but wrote the entire ending of the movie , in fact it was the first and only writing credit . Escape From LA was caught in development hell for over ten years . A script for the film was first commissioned in 1985 but John Carpenter thought it ""too light, too campy"" . An initial script was written , but it remained dormant until Carpenter and Kurt Russell got together with frequent collaborator Debra Hill. It was Russell's persistence that got the film made ; Snake Plissken was his favourite character, a character he loved and wanted to play again . Support cast is frankly good such as Peter Fonda , Cliff Robertson , Valeria Golino , Stacy Keach , Pam Grier , Bruce Campbell , Michelle Forbes , A.J. Langer and Peter Jason , Carpenter's usual . The picture contains an imaginative and memorable production design by Lawrence G. Paull . Colorful and glimmer cinematography by Gary B. Kibbe . John Carpenter also made the atmospheric music score along with Shirley Walker . The movie likely to satisfy action enthusiasts and Kurt Russell fans .

Director John Carpenter is in familiar ground with this well-done tale on the style of comic books and old Sci-Fi serials . His films often feature important visuals shown from a video screen , as the end-of-the-world transmission from the future in ¨Prince of darkness¨ (1987), the Norwegian recordings of the expedition to uncover the aliens in ¨The Thing¨ (1982), various TV sets and the general anti-TV motif in ¨They live¨(1988), etc. ¨1997 escape from N.Y¨ was realized during his best period in the 70s and late 8os when he directed classics as ¨Halloween¨, ¨The fog ¨, ¨Christine¨, ¨They live¨ , ¨Big Trouble in Little China¨ and ¨The thing¨ . The sequel ¨Escape from L.A¨ rating : average but entertaining . The movie will enjoy to noisy action fans but packs a roller-coaster thriller and wholesome amusement . The film will appeal to John Carpenter enthusiasts . A third sequel was going to be made titled Escape from Earth which would have had Snake escaping Earth after a dark matter experiment. However, the negative reaction to this film prevented the sequel from being developed. As the movie was a notorious failure on release, making around $25 million , just half its budget , at the US box office. Many reviews criticized the film for being too violent or for being too similar to the original film ."
Bogus (1996),"I quite liked it... I had never seen anything about this movie before it came on TV. I just read that it had Whoopi Goldberg in it, and I am a fan of hers.

The movie is about a little boy, named Albert who loses his mother in a car wreck. He has to go and live with his mothers foster sister (played by Whoopi) who knows absolutely nothing about children. So the kid gets an imaginary friend.

The film is sad in places... i felt sorry for Albert. Haley Joel Osment played Albert... his work was not very convincing in parts of the movie. But then it is so hard to find a good child actor. I think I can name only 2 really great child actors. (Maisie Williams & Dakota Fanning)

Whoopi Goldberg is a brilliant actress and she does another great job in this. I think she is one of the best actresses in America. I loved her in the Sister Act movies, Ghost, Made in America and Burglar... but my favourite film of hers is Jumpin' Jack Flash. Her character is a career driven person who does not have the time for kids. Whoopi was convincing and I felt sorry for her through the movie because she really was thrown in the deep end really by having this boy dumped in her lap.

Gerard Depardieu plays the imaginary friend named Bogus. He also did a good job. He was funny in places and really believable that he cares.

I don't really have anything bad to say about this movie, except maybe Haley wasn't very good at certain points.

The story was good. It made me smile and made me feel sad in places.

A good movie... I will give this 7 out of 10. I hope to see Whoopi back in a blockbuster where she belongs very soon.

Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers (1995),"John Carpenter's 1978 'Halloween' is wholly deserving of its status as a horror classic. To this day it's still one of the freakiest films personally seen and introduced the world to one of horror's most iconic villainous characters Michael Myers.

Which is why it is such a shame that not only are all of the sequels nowhere near as good but that the decline in quality is so drastic. Ok, the original 'Halloween' is very difficult to follow on from, but most of the sequels could at least looked like effort was made into them. 'Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers' is a prime example of this, a film with very little to recommend and just very poorly done in many areas.

Starting with the very few good things, Paul Rudd and Donald Pleasance, in his last film before his death from heart failure not long after (although his screen time is far too short and was clearly severely truncated), come off in a good way in the acting department.

The exploding head death is a pretty fun one and the setting is eerie. As far as praises go, that is it.

'Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers' was directed by someone who had an apparent dislike for Pleasance, the main reason for his limited screen time most likely, and had no interest in directing the film or the 'Halloween' series in general, and it shows loud and clear on screen. Even the direction in 'Season of the Witch' and 'Halloween 5' wasn't this indifferent or inept.

Sadly the effectiveness of the setting, which actually is eerie, is hindered by the filming and editing being pretty amateurish, the photography often is far too dark and drab and the editing makes bacon-slicer-like editing seem coherent in comparison. The music, like the previous film, is here a drawback when it was one of the better elements of the first four films. Here it sounds cheap, goofy and would have sounded out of date even in the 80s most likely.

Everything looks, sounds and feels like it was made in a rush and with absolutely no heart, accounting for the constant sense of incompleteness. There is nothing scary or suspenseful, it's unintentionally campy, uncomfortably strange and by the numbers with a convoluted story that makes no sense whatsoever, an abrupt ending, dull pacing and the man in black/cult plot that is just bizarre and just muddles everything. Michael Myers is just not creepy enough and looks goofy.

Very like the previous sequel, there is nothing interesting or endearing about the characters (though none are quite as annoying as Tina in 'Halloween 5'). The script especially sounds incomplete and the acting, apart from Rudd and Pleasance (whose screen time, as said, is far too short), is subpar to put it lightly. J.C. Brandy is a pretty poor replacement for Danielle Harris.

Overall, don't expect any terror, scares, fear or thrills here, you'll be disappointed. 3/10 Bethany Cox"
"Gay Divorcee, The (1934)","The Gay Divorcée is the answer to the trivia question of which of Fred Astaire's and Ginger Rogers's is one that Fred Astaire had previously done on Broadway. When Astaire did it on Broadway, the Cole Porter musical had been entitled The Gay Divorce. But that extra 'e' was added on lest anyone get the idea that divorce itself was something frivolous. Imagine anticipating Britney Spears by about 70 years.

Actually Fred had also done Funny Face and The Bandwagon on stage as well. But on stage The Bandwagon was a revue and Funny Face had an entirely different plot than the musical made by Astaire in the Fifties. Only in The Gay Divorcée was he asked to repeat a stage role.

The basic plot is still the same, the usual Astaire-Rogers case of mistaken identity. Ginger is the budding divorcée going to London to get a divorce as Aunt Alice Brady hired a professional co-respondent. Ginger mistakes Fred for that co-respondent and it takes a while for Fred to warm her up.

Fred's an American musical comedy star visiting London with his manager Edward Everett Horton who also happens to know Brady. This gives the excuse for the musical numbers.

Cole Porter's score was cut completely from the screen other than the immortal Night and Day. In it's place came four songs, three written by Harry Revel&Mack Gordon and one written by Con Conrad&Herb Magdison. Fred and Ginger dance divinely to Night and Day.

Fred does a solo dance to A Needle in a Haystack and Don't Let It Bother You. Betty Grable got her first notice from the movie going public, singing and dancing in Let's Knock Knees all of which were contributed by Revel&Gordon.

But it was The Continental number by Con Conrad and Herbert Magdison that got the first Academy Award ever given out for Best Original Song in a motion picture. It's what The Gay Divorcée is remembered for today. It's a rather long, between ten and fifteen minutes of screen time, but as magical as ever

The Gay Divorce ran for 248 performances on Broadway during the 1932- 1933 season. Sacrificed for romance are Porter's witty lyrics in the rest of the score containing their usual commentary on the social scene. Of all the American musical giants of the era, I would say that Cole Porter wins hands down as the man that Hollywood butchered the most in bringing his work to the screen. Even before The Code was in place, it seemed that the powers that be deemed that his work was way too sophisticated and naughty to be seen and heard as is.

Still with the film being frothy romance instead of social commentary, The Gay Divorcée is still great entertainment. Also repeating their roles from Broadway are supercilious waiter Eric Blore and the real co-respondent Tonetti who prefers spaghetti, Erik Rhodes.

Wit for romance, you decide if it was a fair exchange."
Ninotchka (1939),"""Garbo Laughs!"" was the tagline splattered on posters of Ninotchka, regardless of whether or not she'd actually laughed in other movies. She had, but if you want to see her guffaw and pound the table, you'll have to rent this one. It's a classic silver screen comedy, and one of the few old movies that are still known to modern audiences. It's tailor-made for the Swedish star, who famously rattles off, ""Don't make an issue of my womanhood,"" during her entrance. Greta Garbo was such a mannish star, yet in her earlier films, she was always cast as a sex symbol. Ninotchka is a perfect and hilarious change of pace for her; she's a Russian Communist without frills or romance on her mind, and her natural masculinity can finally be showcased. This was the first of her movies I saw, so I always thought she was a homely actress. When I finally saw her in Camille, I was shocked that she looked so pretty! Melvyn Douglas plays a Parisian playboy who likes all the things Greta doesn't. He tries flirting with her as she asks directions to the Eiffel Tower, and after a few rebuffs, she asks, ""Must you flirt?"" ""Well, I don't have to, but I find it comes naturally,"" Mel smirks. The perfect tamper on his impeccable timing, Greta shuts him up with the order, ""Suppress it."" While his role could have been ably played by any number of Hollywood's leading men, Robert Montgomery, Robert Young, Fred Astaire, Cary Grant, it's Melvyn Douglas who's immortalized as Greta's counterpoint, and it's part of the reason he's so well-remembered from his leading man days in the silver screen.

Technically, the film is categorized as an adapted screenplay. However, the source upon which it was based was a three-sentence idea from the MGM studio: ""Russian girl saturated with Bolshevist ideals goes to fearful, capitalistic, monopolistic Paris. She meets romance and has an uproarious good time. Capitalism not so bad, after all."" That's it, folks; that's what the screenwriters had to work with. Thankfully, that's not at all how the movie comes across; it's not a political commentary. This is a romance between an innocent girl who's never been treated to the high life and a playboy who learns to see life through her eyes.

In a movie showcasing Greta Garbo, with the endless comic talents of Melvyn Douglas, with a hilarious screenplay, it's amazing that the person who runs away with the movie has nearly the smallest part. Felix Bressart, a German actor who fled to the United States during the Nazi rise to power, made his American splash in Ninotchka and made several movies per year for the next ten years. His unique look, his sweet, soft voice, and the sincerity of his emotions wins the audience over in any given scene. In one scene, Melvyn is getting the three silly sidekicks-Felix Bressart, Sig Ruman, and Alexander Granach were ironically all German actors playing Russians-drunk while trying to trick information out of them. ""Why are you so good to us?"" Felix coos, embracing Mel. ""Yes, why are you so good to us?"" the others chime in, covering Mel with kisses. It's such an adorable moment in an adorable movie, one that will instantly make you a fan of the new German star.

There are so many great scenes, sweet moments, and hilarious one-liners that will have you popping in Ninotchka time after time. My VHS copy from high school is nearly worn through, I've watched it so many times. When Greta Garbo tastes champagne for the first time, such an adorable expression passes across her face. She insists she should be punished for being so happy, so Mel pretends to execute her in the firing squad via a champagne bottle. The silly hat, the goat milk, and the cigarette girls all leave you smiling and wanting more. Why is the movie so good to us? Lots of reasons, so if you haven't found out yet, watch it tonight!"
Meet John Doe (1941),"""Meet John Doe"" has in it some good performances. Walter Brennan played Gary Cooper's cynical hobo friend almost to perfection, at least as well as the role could be played given the flawed script. He saw the conventional world as one full of ""heelots"" (lots of heels) who were only after the other guy's money. Cooper, as John Doe, handed in a credible performance, as well, and Barbara Stanwick, when she wasn't overacting, was generally interesting to watch and easy on the eyes. The actors portraying the newspaper editor and the media magnate were also effective. But this story and this script, while reaching for greater meaning, had the unfortunate tendency to fall back on schmaltzy clichés and flag-waving propaganda and that kept the movie from realizing its full promise and potential. Director Capra, whose talents were greatly admired in the movie industry, didn't seem able to make up his mind if he wanted this thing to be a somewhat saccharine, albeit uplifting Christmas movie about people forgetting their petty differences and coming together, or something quite different, that being a cynical and gritty political statement about the rich and powerful's compelling need to use and abuse the common man. The movie tried to combine elements of both themes yet it only partly succeeded on either score. In contrast, ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" which attempted much the same thing, succeeded where ""Meet John Doe"" missed the mark. It was a far more effective Christmas movie, yet at the same time contained significant elements that examined dishonesty, cruelty, and greed. Still, ""Meet John Doe,"" a less admired, less focused, and less consistent effort featured some compelling scenes. I thought the argument between Doe and DB Norton, the fascist media magnate who was hoping to launch a presidential bid on the strength of the John Doe Clubs, was probably the best scene in the film, although Walter Brennan's speech about the ""heelots"" was also quite good. The mob scene, reminiscent of Christ's crucifixion, no doubt was intended to be the film's most powerful sequence, and on balance it was fairly gripping. Unfortunately, it contained obvious continuity errors that detracted seriously from its believability. For example, Norton's troopers grabbed Doe to stop him from speaking to the crowd and exposing Norton's evil scheme, then all of a sudden, they released him and stood back, allowing him to weakly defend himself in front of the mike. Whereas the mob seemed to sympathize with him even when disillusioned by the disturbing allegations leveled against him, suddenly they were out for his blood. It didn't really add up, at least not as it unfolded. The last scene in the movie, where Doe climbed City Hall intending to commit suicide, aspired to be a very moving moment but was even more flawed. The magnate and his fellow conspirators were on hand and they didn't want him to go through with it because it might spoil their attempts to salvage what was left of their meglomaniacal aims, but evidently they felt somewhat guilty for their part in his destruction. Doe simply brushed them aside, and in what was perhaps Coop's most convincing moment, he was just about to leap to his death when Barbara Stanwick dashed forward to stop him. Unfortunately, that's when the movie took a real nosedive. Her lines were painfully contrived and delivered in a thoroughly unconvincing manner. As such, the ending was like the rest of the flick, inching up on something quite good and then falling flat. Too bad; with more polishing, significant editing and re-shooting, it could have been a much better movie."
Pollyanna (1960),"A little orphan named Pollyanna (Hayley Mills with her English accent intact) goes to live with her strict (but sweet) Aunt Polly (Jane Wyman). She's so nauseatingly sweet that all the mean old people in the town find warmth, love and happiness through her. Yuck! Even for Disney this is syrupy.

This is a typical live action Disney film. Everybody talks in a G rated way, all the mean (but secretly nice) adults end up being sweet and kind and all the kids are ridiculously cute and ""lovable"". The story itself is just ridiculous--even for Disney. A little orphan spreading peace and love all around. Sheesh! The acting is pretty bad too. Talented actors like Wyman, Richard Egan and Karl Malden (as a priest!) can do little with the lousy dialogue. Mills is terrible also --but she was only 14 when she did this. Only Agnes Moorehead manages a performance. The film also moves VERY slow--it runs over 2 hours! Also the last 20 minutes are so unbelievably manipulative I actually felt like throwing something heavy at the TV! Too long, too sweet and too unbelievable. This gets a 2 for Moorehead alone."
