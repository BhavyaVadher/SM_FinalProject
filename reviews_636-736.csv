Movie,Review
Paths of Glory (1957),"We're still wondering where Stanley Kubrick wanted to go with this Paths of Glory.

Even though the historic facts on which it relies on are far from being uninteresting, the plot is, the dramatic tension is almost non-existent and the story goes from one subject to another from scene to scene with not much coherence.

As for the form, granted the cinematography is beautiful with some excellent tracking shots in the trenches and an exceptional travelling shot in the no man's land, but the mise-en-scène is sometimes almost ridiculous when for example two characters are climbing stairs, then stop halfway through, then separate in opposite directions.

To sum up, it's hard to grasp Kubric's logic, what he wanted to tell, the level of analysis is superficial and even though the movie is barely an 1h30 long, you just want to get to the end of it."
"Grifters, The (1990)","Most films have one, and only one, protagonist around whom the story is told. But ""The Grifters"" has three, all of them petty swindlers, desperate for quick cash or good odds at a ""long con"". And it's the personal relationships among these three criminals, complex, sometimes dark, and almost always motivated by survival, that make this film a pretty good bet.

Roy Dillon (John Cusack), is a trickster, a loner, ""on the grift"" for the ""short con"", strictly a nickels and dimes man. His mom is Lilly (Anjelica Huston); she's a middle-aged lady with white hair; she's seductive, cold-blooded, and tough as nails; she's been around the block a few times. Roy's love interest is Myra (Annette Bening), a shapely, fun loving babe who uses her charms to con rich businessmen. These three people are highly manipulative and scheming, on-guard, and mistrustful of each other and the rest of the world.

The film's tone is bleak and gloomy. There's very little ""heart"" in this film. And that's a problem, because I found these characters not very sympathetic. They lead lives of quiet desperation, grimy and tawdry. Still, ""The Grifters"" is a crime story in the best tradition of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, a pulpy melodrama about the underbelly of urban America.

The film's structure is conventional, and contains a number of flashbacks. The set-up is tediously long. The second half of the film is better than the first half, in my opinion, because the second half contains more suspense.

Dialogue is direct and tough, like when Lilly makes her point to the ambulance driver who takes Roy to the hospital and is skeptical about Roy's chances for survival: Says Lilly: ""My son is gonna be alright, if not, I'll have you killed"". Later, she explains the facts of life to her son: ""Grifts like anything else Roy, you don't stand still, you either go up or down, usually down, sooner or later"". Yes indeed, it's a tough life being a ""grifter""; but Lilly is one tough broad.

The film's color cinematography is fine. And the film has a terrific title sequence and a great Elmer Bernstein score at the beginning. Editing, costumes, and production design are all credible.

If you're in the mood for a gritty, bleak story of petty criminals in a well made modern film, ""The Grifters"" is a good choice. As a bonus, the DVD has an exceptionally good Commentary, with insightful comments from Director Stephen Frears, and actors John Cusack and Anjelica Huston."
"Thin Blue Line, The (1988)","Regarding the issue of manipulation, lets face it people, all documentaries are manipulative - every documentary filmmaker is attempting to make a point, whether or not they care to admit it. It is the documentaries that give the impression of being ""objective"" that are, in fact, the most manipulative. In the case of ""The Thin Blue Line"" the purpose of the documentary is clear, and the viewer is not tricked into believing that they are watching something objective. Instead, it is quite upfront about its purpose, and therefore is a much more honest piece of work. People should never accept anything they see in a documentary as fact, it's important to understand that documentaries are simply an attempt to present the director's perspective of a real-life situation. It is the great documentaries that present their perspective in a convincing manner, and do so without boring the viewer to sleep. Here ""The Thin Blue Line"" succeeds very well: it is powerful, it is engaging, and it's extremely convincing. Does that mean that everyone should be convinced? Lets hope not. However, it certainly should give everyone something to think about.

The only real problem with the film is its over-use of re-enactments where they are not really that necessary. For example, there is an image of a clock, representing the futility of time, which is too long for its own good. The milkshake scene was also (intentionally)annoying. However, this is a minor problem, and not one that should bother most people. Overall: great film, and highly recommended."
Paris Is Burning (1990),"I waited a while to post a review of this documentary because when I first saw it over 10 years ago, I wanted to think carefully about what I wanted to write.

I found from a documentary standpoint that this is a darned good documentary. It did what it set out to do, show me something I had no idea about and kept me interested in this world it explored. I knew nothing of the Drag world and finding out about them and the ""Balls"" was just spectacular to me. These folks were just so talented with what they do and how they do it, for competition. The catty folks, the complainers (even I was angry when someone told the judge that the coat the Drag Queen was wearing wasn't a man's coat!), the jealous, it's all there like in every other competition. LIKE EVERY OTHER COMPETITION like it. Which I felt was a point.

You had the older drag queen talking about how the Balls ""used"" to be compared to the newer drag queens who have changed the Balls and made more competition categories -- and even those who looked on knowing that the future of Balls would change even more when they were ready to walk the runway. It was interesting to hear that some of the contestants were living out on the street two minutes before the ball but came to compete, it was that important to them! Then there was sad stories, stories of who's ""house"" and ""house mother"" brought out the best and the brightest in competition. It was interesting.

Now to add after 10 years of seeing this film, I lived through the so called 'Madonna' craze. I spotted a few familiar faces from this documentary who ended up with Madonna during her ""Vogue"" phase and rightfully so. If not for those individuals, Madonna wouldn't have HAD a ""Vogue"" phase, I know that now. Credit should be given where credit is DUE. Makes me wonder, if anyone else from mainstream America would watch this documentary, they'll learn they're not as ""mainstream"" as they think."
Once Upon a Time in the West (1969),"Once Upon a Time in the West (1968)

On the heels of ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly,"" is this equally sprawling and archetypal Western, this time with less obvious dubbing, and Henry Fonda as a kind of tie in to Hollywood's hero paradigm. It's indescribably beautiful, one of the most gorgeous Westerns ever photographed, indeed a model for good visual directing and cinematography in any genre. That alone makes the almost three hours a pure pleasure.

But it's not a fast movie in any other way. It can't be. It depends on lingering over delicious details, small ones, shot up close in startling detail and ever deadpan looks and steely eyes. Nothing is believable and it's not meant to be. It's not even a fable, quite, but more a celebration of being inside an incredible film, as strange as that sounds. Not that the scenes are not believable--even the very last shots of the makeshift town and the railroad being built is about as realistic as it gets. Great stuff.

Plot? You might, at times, wonder where the plot went. There are lots of bad guys, and you're not totally sure there's a protagonist, unless the one woman in the movie is the center of our concerns, even if she is clearly a bystander to it all. When it gets clear, in the last twenty minutes, it's again archetypal (and has echoes of the over the tops showdown in ""Good Bad and Ugly""). A small bit of slow motion (not needed normally in a movie where everything is slow already) makes clear this is the key moment in the film, the thing that made the rest of it, with all its confusing and violent layers, sensible.

For my money, I'd love all this incredible visceral stuff, the sounds and sights, filled in with some kind of deeply felt conflict, not a purely dramatic one. I watch and am shocked, or swept away, or impressed, or dazzled, but I'm actually never moved, not from the heart. And there are plenty of aspects here that should really move us--including feeling for the woman's plight, rather than simply recognizing that it is, after all, quite a plight.

Still, another landmark Sergio Leone movie."
Ran (1985),"Realizing that it is practically heresy in the film world to criticize a Kurosawa film, much less downright dislike it, I'd like to precede my review by saying that I have absolutely loved every Kurosawa film I've seen  until now. ""Ran"", Kurosawa's 1985 film based somewhat on Shakespeare's ""King Lear"" is the story of an elderly emperor who hands down his kingdom to the oldest of his three sons. While the oldest and middle son fan over each other, saying that they are not deserving, etc. it is the youngest who speaks his mind about the subject, incurring the wrath of his father and ultimately, banishment from the area. Meanwhile, the two older sons are making a mess of things with the kingdom, leading to wars, fratricide and the dismissal of their father, even attempting his murder. None of their motives are noble or honorable, only avarice and power motivate them, leading to tragedy for all.

Going into this, I knew that this was not going to be a light story by any means. For anyone who has read or is familiar with Lear, it is a story that is pretty much slogged through, though it is wonderfully told. ""Ran"" can pretty much be described the same way. While I certainly appreciated the good acting, the unbelievable costumes and the set design as a whole, I found myself unable to become engaged in the story. The pacing was extremely slow, certainly not an easy thing to deal with during a film that lasts about 2 hours and 40 minutes. Unfortunately, for myself at least, it is the pacing, visuals and story that can really make a foreign film a success for me, and I found that ""Ran"" only had one compelling element out of the three, which managed to save it from being an absolute dud, but not enough to make it as awesome as Kurosawa's other films are. (And in using the word awesome, I really mean the word ""awe"") Because of the costumes, at times arresting imagery, and the ultimate fate of Lady Kaede (which bumped up the film by an entire point for me because of its bluntness) I'm not completely panning the film. While I feel the film was a bit disappointing, I'm more disappointed in myself for not being able to like it as much as I would have wanted, since it has had such amazing reviews. But since you can't like them all, ""Ran"" gets a 5/10 from me.

"Quiet Man, The (1952)","I am uncertain how to critique this film objectively. I will start by making a critique of some other critiques. One complaint is the 'stereotypes' of the Irish. These complaints reveal both the Political Correctness of the complainers  and their ignorance. The Director, John Ford (real name Sean Aloysius O'Fearna) was born and raised in Ireland and was very much the moving force in producing this movie. Why? Because he liked the script. The leading lady, Maureen O'Hara (real name Maureen Fitzsimons) was also born and raised in Ireland. She also helped get the film produced. Why? Because she liked the script.

Now, If these two Irish born participants in the picture don't find anything offensive, why should we? The greatest offense seems to be depicting the Irish as people who like to drink and fight. Having known many Irishmen I can say many do, in fact, like to drink and fight. Stereotypes usually originate in a firm foundation of fact.

Secondly, they are horribly offended by the 'violence against women', blah, blah, blah. Now, the Maureen O'Hara and John Wayne characters in this movie were repeated pretty much hereafter in every picture they did together. It is, in fact, a very old theme. People who hate the idea of a fiery, strong willed female finally tamed by a confident, dominant male can find equal hatred for Shakespeare, just read 'Taming of the Shrew'. It was an old theme when Shakespeare wrote it.

Sadly, they were so busy being offended they missed what a fine athletic performance Maureen O'Hara gave as John Wayne dragged her along. She was a real trooper. That bit of athletic performance was no mean feat.

Now, back to the film. It seemed syrupy, smalzy and contrived. So bad, at times, it was cloying and annoying. The plot seemed paper thin and artificial, merely a threadbare artifice to generate false conflict. The characters were all stock characters and hence all wholly predictable as was the inevitable outcome. Thus, with no genuine tension and no real character development that drew you in; it was hard to sustain interest in this film.

My difficulty is, as a boy, I use to love all of the John Ford/Maureen O'Hara/John Wayne pictures. Yet, I doubt most of them were any better than this. So why now do I find this so unengaging? I think because as a boy, as did the larger society, we believed these simple smarmy sentiments. I probably believed that when two men fought they would afterwards become friends ( a frequent theme in films of this era). I now know that the victor usually feels contempt for the loser and the loser has a burning hatred of the winner for the humiliation inflicted on him. And so it is with the other sentimental claptrap.

However, it may also be the era in which we live. Now we live where every disgusting, evil human perversion is just a click of the mouse away. Where car jacking, once shocking, are now just accepted as normal life. Where terrorists kill by the thousands and drug dealers enslave by the tens of thousands. We live in an era that has grown callous and cynical. Simple, smarmy sentiments like mom, home and apple pie simply don't hold much water anymore.

So, is impatience for the sugary sentiment in this picture merely a matter of growing up? Is it like the Bible says, ""When I was a child I thought like a child and acted as a child, but now I am a man and have put aside childish ways"".

Or, is it because both I and the society at large have grown hard, callous and cynical? Perhaps a little of both.

But remember, the generation that saw the release of this film loved this film. Even Hollywood did, giving it two Academy awards. And they were grown ups, having lived through a Great Depression and a World War. Certainly, they had no illusions.....

So perhaps it is just us..... A newer generation without illusions, but also without faith."
Once Upon a Time in America (1984),"In order to cater to their everlasting lust for making money, the movie production studios have always endorsed the motto of quid pro quo – ""A favor in return of another"". Every movie-maker capable enough to be called an auteur—by the virtue of his knack for eccentricity and novelty—has had to borne the brunt of this naked opportunism: be it D.W. Griffith, Charles Chaplin, Orson Welles or Stanley Kubrick. Sergio Leone too had to pay collaterally by having to make five Westerns in order to get funding for his dream project, Once Upon a time in America (OUTA). OUTA is a masterpiece of epic proportions and is consummate on almost every level. The uniqueness of the movie is such that it can be looked upon from various angles with each perspective adding immensely to movie's substance and profundity. The movie not only transcends genres by making simultaneous forays into the realms of Crime, Drama, Mystery, Suspense and Fantasy, but also crosses on several occasions the fine line that separates Dream from Reality.

At the beginning of his career, Leone got widely proclaimed as a master of technique and style as he added new dimensions to cinematography and screenplay. Leone's directorial debut was 'A Fistful of dollars'. Movie's success was marred when Akira Kurosawa sued the production house for plagiarizing Yojimbo. Leone bounced back with 'For a Few More Dollars'. He single-handedly reinvented the Western genre by providing a completely different perspective to the Old West, which was hitherto portrayed as the battle ground for the epic battle of virtue versus vice in the backdrop of chivalry and machismo. With 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly', Leone perpetuated what would become his trademark: Spaghetti Western. Leone's distinctive style included juxtapositions, super close- ups, long continuous shots, and the rotating camera shots. Leone's collaboration with master-composer Ennio Morricone gave cinema some of its most mellifluous compositions. Once Upon a Time in the West elevated Leone from the position of a showman to a serious movie-maker—an auteur capable of much profound works. Leone refused a multitude of projects, including the opportunity to direct 'The Godfather', in a bid to realize his dream project.

OUTA is an epic crime saga based on the lives of Jewish gangsters from their humble childhood in the ghettos of New York to their rise in world of organized crime. 'Noodles', 'Patsy', 'Cockeye', and little Dominic struggle as street kids in the East Side of Manhattan in the early 1920s. They work for 'Bugsy', a local gangster, until they meet 'Max' and decide to start an independent operation, triggering a series of incidents which changes their lives for ever. Robert De Niro as 'Noodles' gives one of the most subtle performances of his career. James Woods is chillingly menacing as 'Max'. Young 13-year-old Jennifer Connelly as 'Deborah' serves as a pulchritudinous delight for the sour eyes, and I say this as a testament to her ethereal, nymphean charm that was evident even at such a tender age. The rest of the cast gives a great support to the actors in lead with special mention of Elizabeth McGovern, James Hayden and Joe Pesci. The music is composed by Leone's long-time collaborator Ennio Morricone, who once again works his magic by creating music that is so plaintively divine that even Mozart would be proud of it.

The film poignantly explores the themes of love, lust, friendship, greed, betrayal and loss of innocence in the backdrop of the 20th century America. For the European release, Leone cut down his original version to 229 minutes to appease the distributors. However, for the US release, OUTA was ignominiously edited down to 139 minutes by the muddle-headed studio personnel against the director's wishes. In this short version, the flashback narrative was omitted as the scenes were put back in the chronological order. Many of the movie's most beautiful shots are not present in the shorter version, including the nigh magical sequence in which time-switching is indicated by the conjuration of a Frisbee. Movie's abysmal show in the US is attributed to this sabotage. Leone was reportedly heartbroken by the American cut, and never made another film again.

The dreamlike screenplay of OUTA gives it a lyrical, almost hypnotic feel. OUTA is a tapestry of highly complex mesh work: the story depicts the lives of same individuals across three different timelines. The time-switching techniques used in the movie are so effective that the switching seems absolutely seem-less. The mystical ringing tone that the viewer gets to hear in the beginning of the movie provides a great subterfuge in unison with the dream-like finale, and adds surrealistic elements to the movie by raising doubts that the events depicted in the movie could well have been a part of a drug-induced dream that Noodles would have been experiencing under the hypnotic effect of opium. The movie has a multitude of unforgettable moments, which can be cherished again and again with the same levels of indulgence. The sequence in which little Dominic—caught between the want to satiate his newly attained puberty and the fundamental urges—buys a pastry to charm a neighborhood girl, but succumbs to the universal temptation and ends up eating it himself is pure gold. The scene which depicts Robert De Niro molesting his childhood love represents cinema at its most macabre. The make-up, set designing and costume designing are all top- notch. The make-up artists have gone about their business with such meticulousness that the actors seem to genuinely represent their character's age in each era.

Overall, OUTA is a testament to Sergio Leone's dedication to the free spirit of Art. It succeeds at multiple levels and makes the viewer go through an entire gamut of emotions, keeping him engaged throughout. It is sanguinary and is surfeited with blood-cuddling violence that makes it unsuitable for the weak-hearted. OUTA, however, is as a must for the enthusiasts of the genre and the cineastes worldwide. 10/10

Glory (1989),"When I finished watching this film I honestly felt sick. It is one of the most patronising and formulaic films that I've seen in a long time that serves the viewer nothing but overblown sentimentality and self-righteousness.

Race is an extremely important issue that deserves to be treated with respect. This film merely seeks to exploit the highly emotionally charged issues in a pathetic attempt to try and bring hollow tears to the faces of its viewers.

Everything in this film is done by the book. All the stereotypical characters are there, lined up and ready to be used in the most cliché of fashion. The film doesn't even try and tell a story but instead stick a load of over the top scenes together, accompanied by an extremely annoying pretentious score, that try to create many climactic ""moments"" to try and move the viewer.

Another thing that really annoyed me about this film is the title itself, ""Glory"". What is really glorious about a load of men getting killed, black or white? The film doesn't even try to portray the foolishness of war and instead resorts to partiotically flag-waving, proud that America was founded on such bloodshed. Mel Gibson in a kilt screaming ""FREEDOM"" at the top of his lungs would not seem out of place.

However, when you spray as many emotional scenes about the place at least a couple are going to hit their targets. The scene where Matthew Broderick is shouting at the stuttering squirrel shooter and fireing his pistol did manage to get a response out of me. This is because it was one of the few scenes that decided to leave race alone and attempt to deal with the reality of war. Another couple of scenes were well done too, but these scenes' resonance was muted by the overall quality of the others.

The battle scenes were well done, in a sense that they looked realistic. I thought that these might be able to help save the film but, to my dismay, as soon as I'm starting to believe in them another highly telegraphed clichéd plot point comes along that completely breaks up the intensity and disintegrates into farce.

There isn't really a lot more than I can say about the film. I can't really comment on the quality of the acting because the actors were forced to play such one dimensional characters. I had been recommended this movie by a couple of people and had really high hopes for it, but instead of being a glorious experience it was condesending and repulsive."
Touch of Evil (1958),"Orson Welles was never again to direct in the Hollywood system after making this tale of good versus evil, which was the studio systems loss a man of great talent behind the camera but had the ego to boot.

In an American/Mexican border town a car bomb sets into motion a series of violence and crime, endangering Mexican Lawman Vargas (Heston) and newly Bride Susan (Janet Leigh)

Touch of Evil is all about the direction as Welles is able to show off his directional talents and then some. From the maybe most talked about opening, a bravura 3 minute tracking shot following a car with a bomb planted in the trunk, down a seedy town down to the border patrol to the very last intricate shots set through wastelands to a canal that were in no way logical to the plot but were visually pleasing very much showboating.

The plot is somewhat complex and maybe can't be grasped with just the one viewing given everything that is going on a technically as well. It reverses stereotypes, Vargas a high ranking Mexican narcotics detective and upstanding citizen with morals and an American wife. Hank Quinlan (Welles) who's power and high status in law enforcement has corrupted his mind, out for justice whether justified or not willing to plant evidence to get his target.

The acting is terrific Heston although he doesn't resemble a Mexican it doesn't matter, I believe it to be one of his best roles. Janet Leigh is stunning to look a real beauty of the screen who holds her own. Welles is a powerhouse not only his performance but also physically, his screen presence is something to marvel.

From that opening scene which sets the atmosphere and dark tone for the rest of the 90 minute or so running time, a couple of really tense scenes (A small room interrogation which also boasts Welles prowess) and at one point something horrifying ( There is an implied Gang rape that for me was pretty unsettling and for the year 1958 was a very brave thing to include in a mainstream movie, although afterwards its not to clear what happens)

This will always be held as a classic and one of the best Film Noirs around ( A genre I'm just getting into) I've seen it twice now and feel with each viewing there will be something different to notice and concentrate on. A great technical achievement that seems to be admired by film viewers and film makers alike. The black and white cinematography is stunning. A thrilling ride from start to finish."
Chinatown (1974),"While I don't care too much for Roman Polanski's style of direction(maybe I'll grow to like it eventually, maybe not), I can't deny that this is a truly great film. Jack Nicholson really shines through in his role, and his acting in this film perfectly fits the character... his shark smile, his voice, his tone... all of it, perfect. I always thought, when watching films with Nicholson, that he'd make a great lead in a noir film, so when I found this film and discovered that it was indeed noir, I naturally saw it as soon as possible. I found the film to have a slightly slower pace than what I would have preferred or expected, but apart from that minor detail, it was flawless. The plot is great, and thoroughly interesting and involving. The pacing, while not fast all the time, is more than acceptable. There are sequences that are really intense and exciting. The acting is great... like I said earlier, Nicholson shines through and really takes this character and makes him his own. The characters are well-written and credible. The special effects are well-done and still hold up pretty well. The dialog is very well-written and memorable. There are quite a few quotable lines, as well. The cinematography is good, and even when the plot doesn't move a lot, Polanski keeps our interest through interesting angles and sequences. I liked that there was often something subtle going on in the background, while we're focusing on what's directly in front of us. While Polanski certainly doesn't possess the attention to detail that Kubrick does, he manages to put a good bit of detail into many of the shots, and there is fairly little left to coincidence or chance, much like Kubrick. The film has a few twists that are quite good, and they come as surprises... I don't think I really saw them coming, and I doubt anyone would be able to. Of course, some might not find the twists to be that impressive, but the story stands on it's own nicely as well. This is a great movie, which should be seen by just about anyone who can take it(it's more than just casually adult in nature, even though there's not that much violence or sex in it). I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys film noir, watching Jack Nicholson in perfect shape in a role that was tailor-made for him, a good mystery, Roman Polanski's direction and just a good movie with a more adult tone that many others. 10/10"
Stand by Me (1986),"I saw Stand By Me yesterday for the first time in one and a half years, (I'm 17) and I absolutely loved it, and it is definitely one of my favourite Stephen King adaptations. I will say I absolutely loved Shawshank Redemption, and despite the fact that it was unfaithful to the book, and badly flawed, I liked It too.

Stand By Me, based on the novella by Stephen King, which I admit I haven't read, not only has a wonderfully engaging story, but it is both funny and moving. This is helped by the strong and wholly believable performances from the entire cast that include Kiefer Sutherland, John Cusack, Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Conell and River Pheonix especially.

The script was very well-crafted, and the film tells brilliantly of the values of friendship and standing together. Other strengths were the beautiful photography and the fine direction from Rob Reiner. But what impressed me most about Stand By Me was not only its nostalgic feel, but despite the hour and a half running time, the characters particularly Chris were so well developed. And I mustn't forget the beautiful song Stand By Me over the end credits.

A beautiful, unforgettable film, with a definite 10/10. Bethany Cox."
M (1931),"An expertly written & masterfully executed example of genre-filmmaking that was far ahead of its time back when it was released and which even today is counted amongst the greatest & most influential works of world cinema, Fritz Lang's M is an intriguing character study that paints an interesting portrait of a serial killer & is a biting criticism of a negligent society as well.

The story of M concerns a serial killer who preys on children & presents an underworld society whose usual business is disrupted due to the everyday raids carried out by the police to apprehend the killer-on-loose. Driven by police's continued failure & increasing losses in their business, the criminal bosses ultimately decide to take matters in their own hands & try to capture the killer all by themselves.

Directed by Fritz Lang, this is the film that the esteemed director called his finest & it's not really difficult to see why. The screenplay & direction brims with creativity, the suspense is wonderfully created & utilized, black-n-white photography is crisp & inventive, editing never lets the story settle down, score & sound effects work in seamless harmony, and Peter Lorre steals the show with a highly compelling performance.

On an overall scale, M is a cinematic treasure that has innovation written all over it. Whether it's the narrative style, leitmotifs, camera angles, sound mixing, symbolism or expressions, the contribution this German classic has made in the world of filmmaking is groundbreaking. A thought-provoking & well-researched study into the mind of a disturbed character, M is a strong meditation on the morals of right & wrong, that has a lot to say about our very own society.

Thoroughly recommended."
"Manchurian Candidate, The (1962)","Wow! I was expecting right wing propaganda, or possibly even (a distant outside chance) left wing propaganda: I certainly wasn't expecting THIS. It isn't propaganda at all. Deriving any kind of message at all from the film is difficult - one might be tempted to conclude that we ought to never trust people who cry cheap political insults like ""communist!"" or ""fascist!"" or ""racist!"" at the first opportunity, but that's just a thought. At any rate, in order to get a message we have to think about the story for ourselves, very carefully, which makes it the very opposite of propaganda.

Here's another bit of advice: don't make the mistake, as I did, of thinking now and then that Frankenheimer is drifting from the point. He knows exactly what he's doing at all times. Whenever it seems he's offering some interesting diversion from the main story he's really telling the main story by other means. How good the story is I cannot convey without saying too much. Probably the central conceit everyone knows already, which was why Frankenheimer was right to spill most of the beans as soon as possible - but he does has one or two in reserve. One great thing about the story is that it doesn't rely at all on us thinking it likely.

Everyone, from composer to cameraman, did a fine job, and the cast does an even finer one. Angela Lansbury gives the performance of her life. Frank Sinatra I had never seen in a movie before, and I was surprised to discover that he can act - very well, too. It permeates down to the minor roles. Leslie Parrish as the charming innocent is certainly charming, but also subtle. ""The Manchurian Candidate"" would easily be the best of its kind even if it weren't the only of its kind."
Pump Up the Volume (1990),"In a career dotted with offbeat and quirky roles Christian Slater was at his most offbeat and quirky in Pump Up The Volume. Slater plays a young transfer student from an eastern high school to a new school in Arizona. His Clark Kent persona is a mild mannered wallflower type. But his father made the mistake of giving him a short wave radio set to keep in touch with friends back east who are presumably ham radio operators. What Slater does is create his own pirate radio station and starts with another whole personality of disc jockey Harry Hardon. Slater's other self isn't Superman, he's more like a teenage version of Howard Beale from Network.

He's amusing at first until one of the students commits suicide after calling in and Slater does little to discourage his intentions. That's a hard call to make, even professionals miss telltale signs of that kind of serious depression.

But when Slater starts disrupting the power structure in the person of principal Annie Ross, the hunt is on with even the Federal Communications Commission brought in to track down this broadcasting felon. Imagine Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest as a school principal and you've got Ross.

The main weakness of Pump Up The Volume is that Slater and Ross create the only two memorable characters. All the rest are strictly in support, we get no insights into any of the rest of the cast. But these two are memorable characters. A teenage mad prophet of the air and a school principal from hell.

Pump Up The Volume is a staple for Christian Slater fans."
Arsenic and Old Lace (1944),"On Halloween day, the writer and drama critic Mortimer Brewster (Cary Grant) secretly marries his next door neighbor Elaine Harper (Priscilla Lane) and they decide to travel to Niagara Falls in honeymoon. Mortimer has written many books criticizing the institution of marriage and his weeding would be a scoop for the reporters and paparazzos.

Mortimer and Elaine take a taxi to Brooklyn to bring their luggage and Mortimer visits his adorable elderly aunts Abby (Josephine Hull) and Martha Brewster (Jean Adair), who raised him and are considered Good Samaritans in the neighborhood, renting rooms and giving meals to the poor. His aunts live with his insane brother Teddy (John Alexander), who believes that is Theodore Roosevelt and is digging locks for the Panama Canal in the basement of the house. When Mortimer is ready to go, he finds a dead body hidden in the window seat and his aunts explains that they have murdered the poor men for charity to stop their suffering serving wine spiked with arsenic and other poisons. Then Teddy buries the corpses in the locks believing that they had yellow fever.

Mortimer decides to send Teddy to the Happy Dale Sanatorium but things get worse when his other insane and cruel brother Jonathan Brewster (Raymond Massey), who had disappeared twenty years ago and has the face of Boris Karloff, unexpectedly appears in the house with his alcoholic partner, the plastic surgeon Dr. Einstein (Peter Lorre), expecting to find a place to dispose the corpse of his victim. The place transforms in a nuthouse.

""Arsenic and Old Lace"" is a hilarious screwball comedy by Frank Capra based on a theater play. The plot and the characters are very funny with Josephine Hull and Jean Adair performing two innocent serial-killers believing that the death of their victims is charity. Cary Grant exaggerates in his reaction and he seems to be crazier than his insane relatives, but the result is wonderful. My vote is eight.

Title (Brazil): ""Este Mundo é um Hospício"" (""This World is a Sanatorium"")"
Fried Green Tomatoes (1991),"Sometimes sad and sometimes amusing, ""Fried green tomatoes"" is the story of the woman's value. A imaginative and touching film about much things... things about life.

The movie talks about of several women that in spite of a hard and sad life caused by the indifference of people who perhaps never had such a big heart as them, they survive thanks to the love and the understanding.

Besides the beautiful plot, the performances of Kathy Bates, Jessica Tandy, Mary Louise Parker and Mary Stuart Masterson are more than special, are unique, exquisite and of course touching.

""Fried Green Tomatoes"" is a little of all. So, don't wait just tears, don't wait just laughs, don't wait just an overflow of feelings. This is not only a drama movie. This movie is more than that.

* Excuse me for mistakes in words."
High Noon (1952),"One of the first movies to use the ""real time"" gimmick, this western works really great. Of course back when it came out, this movie got into a lot of trouble. The movie was brand-marked as anti-American and was blacklisted. It even got disliked by John Wayne and Howard Hawks (who btw. apparently made Rio Bravo as an response to this very movie) very publicly!

Of course the movie is not a blueprint of how Westerns worked back then and does have some social criticism. But it's also something that makes it almost timeless. Because what it does point out (put yourself into the main characters shoes), is relevant today and I'm sure will be relevant in a couple of years too. It's about human nature and about society. One of the best movies made in that sense (in my eyes).

Of course I can understand that some people do not like this at all (the lack of ""action"", the lead actors behavior etc.), but you have to figure that out for yourself"
Candyman (1992),"You'd think perhaps from the title that the film wouldn't be as good as it turned out to be. Based on Clive Barker's excellent, intelligent and very chilling book, Candyman is a very good film.

The production values are great and very stylish. The cinematography is beautiful, and the setting and lighting is suitably atmospheric. The atmosphere also really helps, and the more disturbing bits do not thankfully come across as laughable or fake, thanks to the atmosphere and other factors it is genuinely chilling. Phillip Glass's hypnotic and goosebump-inducing score is also very effective, Bernard Rose directs brilliantly, the story is always gripping with Candyman's origins especially well done the dialogue is thought-provoking, intelligent and fits each scene accordingly.

The film is a good length and goes at a well-judged pace. The performances are impressive too, Virginia Madsen is simply terrific in a difficult role while Tony Todd is absolutely terrifying down from his posture to his voice. In fact, for me the only real downside was the ending, it was a sort of ""it's not over"" ending, and for me(I may be biased as I am not a fan of this type of ending) it felt tacky. In conclusion, an atmospheric horror film that delivers on pretty much every level. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
Cat People (1982),"Paul Schrader's version of Cat People is a movie that I've heard of, but never seen. After reading some of the reviews of the movie, I've decided to see on my own for the first time. I must say that I wasn't expecting a whole lot out of this movie because a lot of people who have seen it compared it to the original 1942 Val Lewton picture from RKO. Well, I was very impressed by this version of Cat People and I must say that it's a exceptionally well made, well acted psychological horror film.

Irena, (Nastassja Kinski), arrives in New Orleans, visiting her brother, Paul, (Malcolm McDowell), for the first time. As the movie begins, Schrader sets up the movie very well. Hundreds of years ago, the feline group of mysterious people, called the Cat People, have the ability to change into a black leopard after mating. Unknowable to Irena, Paul starts to develop a incestuous feeling toward her as in one scene, which is, one of the best scenes in the movie, he stalks her while she sleeps in his house for the first time.

Soon enough, Irena is given a job at the local zoo in New Orleans by Oliver Yates, (John Heard). Yates soon starts a relationship with Irena after he witnesses her watching a black leopard, roaming around its cage, milling for food. Irena doesn't tell Oliver about her family secret. Instead, the movie gets even better when Heard and Kinski start a relationship between the two while McDowell takes a turn of the worse, using his cat-like instinct to kill and prey on women, living in New Orleans.

Almost some of Paul Schrader's films walk a tightrope between sexual tensions. He never back away from that particular theme in Cat People. Schrader, as you may know, written the screenplay for Taxi Driver and also directed two feature films, Hardcore, which shares some of the same elements in this film and American Gigolo. His films are quite daring, but nevertheless, interesting and engaging.

Some people might look at this movie as a sleazy exploitation horror film. But, to the tell you the truth, it is not. This is a very good looking movie, with great cinematography, showcasing many colorful sets and sights in New Orleans. Some of the scenes are quite suspenseful, almost ranking up there with the Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. The imagery that is used in this movie are very well shot and photographed. One scene that sums it up at all up is when Kinski witnesses a leopard, tearing out a zookeeper's arm. What makes that scene work is that Schrader cuts that with a shot of a pool of blood, running through Kinski's shoes and into a drain in the floor of the zoo. That's very well done, indeed. You can almost feel the darkness and mystery of the picture itself, thanks to the superb music score by Giorgio Moroder.

Nastassja Kinski, I think, steals the movie, away from John Heard and Malcolm McDowell. She is one of the most interesting and mysterious actresses I've ever seen. She provides the movie with a spice of eroticism that lights up the scenes. You can't talk your eyes off of her nor ignore her. She is really something in this movie. Unlike so many other female characters in horror movies, she gives Irena a mind of her own when she develops sexual feeling toward the two completely different men. That's very daring for a actress to do in the movies.

Cat People is a very scary horror film that's very well made by Paul Schrader and also scored very effectively by Giorgio Moroder. An very good movie for adults to see. ★★★ 1/2 3 1/2 stars."
Nosferatu  1922),"I was a bit disappointed in this. I had seen a few of visuals that are sometimes shown because ""Count Orlok"" is so bizarre-looking, so I finally decided to check this famous German silent film out and see what all the fuss was about. Well, it was much ado about nothing, frankly.

Yes, Max Schreck as the Orlok-Dracula was fascinating to view. No one has ever quite duplicated his strange facial features in over 80 years of film-making, makeup or no makeup. That was worth some of the price of the rental, but the story wasn't. It just dragged too much and the other characters weren't much.

I did learn a few things, however, about Bram Stoker's Dracula tale that I don't believe I have heard in other Dracula movies, such as how many and why coffins of dirt accompanied the Dracula on his voyage. That, and a few other tidbits, were interesting, as were the different colored tints on the some of the scenes.

But, story-wise, it's a bit too dated and too slow for today's tastes, I'm afraid. Also, 84 minutes of a fairly-strong pounding of organ music can get to be a little much. Silent film purists will not like that last statement, as they seem to revere these scores, but, hey, all I can say is: ""bite me!"""
"Crucible, The (1996)","After watching ""The Crucible"", my feelings are mixed. This movie was an intense motion picture to watch and even more intense for me to interpret. The story itself is not hard to interpret, but trying to convey my feelings on it is difficult.

The story of ""The Crucible"" is very basic: a community, mad with hysteria, brings itself to its downfall. The story centers on Abigail Williams, played by Winona Ryder. She was the maid of John Proctor and his wife, Elizabeth, played by Daniel Day-Lewis and Joan Allen. Elizabeth suspects John of adultery with Abigail, so she and John agree to fire her. Abigail resorts to witchcraft to try and win John's heart, but when her uncle (the Reverend of their village's church) witnesses her dancing with other young girls of the community, she and her cousin are set into a panic. Their dancing was believed to be sinful and full of witchery. The next morning, Abigail's cousin Ruth is paralyzed in bed and this confuses the town. They think that the devil is the one to blame. This sets into motion the hysteria and suspicion of witchcraft and communication with the devil. No one in the village was safe from being condemned by Abigail and her dancing friends. The witch hysteria calls for immediate attention. Enter Judge Thomas Danforth, played by Paul Scofield. There are many trials and many innocent people getting accused of witchery, and no one is exempt, not even John or Elizabeth. The inevitable comes to pass.

I thought that this movie was poorly acted. There were some standouts in lead roles, but the supporting roles seemed to have been overlooked. There are four leads in this movie: John Procter, Abigail Williams, Elizabeth Proctor, and Judge Thomas Danforth. John Procter is played with lackluster enthusiasm by the great, two-time Academy Award Winning Daniel Day-Lewis. He seems to lack passion or care until the last scene, but by that time, I had lost hope and resigned myself to his weak performance. It is slightly unfair, though, that I say this, seeing as it was a pretty good performance, but I am naturally going to be biased as I have seen him in so many considerably better performances, some of the best of film (""My Left Foot"", ""There Will Be Blood"", etc.). He should have thought before he set the bar so high for his work. The other bad lead role was Abigail, played horrifically by Winona Ryder. I'll admit, her performance was bad, very bad, but it didn't help that throughout the movie, I despised her character. Even so, I am one to appreciate devious and villainous characters if they are played with villainy and passion. She gave an uninspired performance, to say the least. One of the lead roles that was superbly acted was the role of Elizabeth, played by Joan Allen. She plays her with such subtlety that I couldn't help liking her performance. She was the only member in the cast to receive an Academy Award nomination. The other wonderfully played lead role was the role of Judge Danforth, played magnificently by Paul Scofield. He played Thomas Moore in ""A Man For All Seasons"", which won him an Academy Award. He is such an implausibly underrated actor; I wish to see him in more roles. He is type-casted in this role, playing another law official, but it's for the better.

The writing is nothing to complain about. It follows fairly accurate with the play, although there are some differences, as you would find with any movie based on a previously written material. This movie, though, has an advantage. It was written by Arthur Miller, the same man who wrote the original play. There weren't too many noticeable differences. One scene played out outside, rather than in the courthouse where it was originally set. The dance of the girls was shown in the film, but in the play it was only talked about, but there weren't too many differences. Naturally, the dialogue was drawn out longer, but the duration of the movie is longer then the duration of the play. I liked the satiric aspect of the movie. If one of the girls had a grudge to bear with any member in town, they would recall an instance in the past that would make officials believe that the person was a witch. I thought that it was funny in a way, but the directing made it less comedic and more pitiful and dramatic. The scenery was dreary and tired and worn down. The filming was bland and forgettable. ""The Crucible"" lends itself better as a play than a movie. This play was based on an event happening at the time that Miller wrote it.

Senator Joseph McCarthy was spitting out accusations everywhere that people were Communists. If they denied that they were Communists, then they were thought guilty and were declared Communists, but if they admitted to being one, then they were let off the hook. This modern day witch-hunt known as ""McCarthyism"" mirrors Miller's play almost exactly.

The movie had many flaws. It made me feel uncomfortable and eerie, which makes me not like it, but thinking over that, I realize that that is possibly the director's intention, and if so, then well done. I can only recommend it to people that are interested in the witch-hunts. It wasn't that boring, it was actually entertaining (in a strange way), but it was very predictable. It was a strange movie, the acting was OK, the story is good, but the direction was weak. There were some very tense moments on screen, which made for thrilling cinema, but its faults are greater then its perks, but I think it would be worth it to check it out."
Volcano (1997),"I think the overall score is a bit harsh.

This is a good throwback from a simpler time.

A 90s disaster film which is tastefully done.

This movie has a good pace.

A good cast with many faces you'll recognise.

Tommy Lee Jones is his usual self, a class act.

I overlooked this when it came out and finally got to see it, at last.

I felt like I had it seen it many times before.

It was an easy watch, good clean fun.

One for the family or if it's in and you're just killing time.

No complaints from me and ignore the negative reviews. It's an old movie that tried it's best.

Well done to all involved."
Conan the Barbarian (1981),"This is really an amazing movie! It is so passionate and intense. It all feels so genuine as well.

During my childhood this was my all-time favorite! From an adult (25) perspective, his movie is as damn amazing as I remember. Thee story and dialog are really damn good. There are so many classic scenes. I got my girlfriend to watch it. She was convinced it was going to be a stupid Arnold muscle movie (it seems almost everyone thinks this) but she loved it.

It's such a change to see such an un-ironic passionate movie. I can't see a movie like this being made today. The nudity and violence were great and added realism without ever being flatly gratuitous.

Don't see Destroyer though, that was absolutely awful."
Wishmaster (1997),"I find some of the reviews a little bit harsh, this was a b movie, and as such wouldn't have had a huge budget, what they had to spend they did a fair job with. It's not bad, nor is it great, but it is fun.

I've always thought this movie was made at the wrong time, it feels like it came from 1987, the gore and story are fitting of that time, even the way it's filmed is somehow dated way before 1997.

The acting is up and down, some of the characters feel like they belong in a cartoon.

Maybe I'm being a bit harsh, but time hasn't been altogether kind.

You have to love that worker's mullet.

It's not bad. 6/10."
I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997),"I saw SCREAM and SCREAM 2 before I saw I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER. I think that I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER is a rip-off of SCREAM, but a rip-off that can be enjoyed. Plots are similar, but not identical. It also has the similar pretty-teenager-being-stabbed-to-death feel to it.

On graduation night, four friends Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt), Helen Shivers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Barry Cox (Ryan Phillippe) and Ray Bronson (Freddie Prinze Jr.) go joyriding while drunk and accidentally run over and supposedly kill somebody in the street. While dumping the body in a bay, the body attacks Barry, then falls into the water. The four assume that he is dead, but the next summer they get notes saying ""I know what you did last summer"". The next thing you know, friends of the four are being murdered left and right and these four become the killer's next targets.

The plot is fair, but not especially interesting. I found the SCREAM plot to be much better. The acting and character development in SCREAM are better too. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sarah Michelle Gellar both do excellent jobs. Freddie Prinze Jr. is the worst actor I've ever seen in my life, and Ryan Phillippe does a fair job. Ann Heche is very good in the part that she has.

The characters, aside from Hewitt, Gellar and Heche, are very thin and rather boring. The killer himself is pretty interesting and fairly cool. The ending of this movie bites. It's maybe worth a rent, but if you want to see a movie of this style I'd recommend URBAN LEGENDS or SCREAM."
In the Line of Fire (1993),"Even at 62 years of age, Clint Eastwood still has what it takes to be in a successful action thriller such as this. Not only was he in an action movie, he did very well. I really enjoyed the film from start to finish because of Eastwood and the villain played by John Malkovich.

This is about an aging Secret Service guy who is haunted by his past. That past urges him to keep the current President safe at all costs with election nearing. Even if that means playing a cat-and-mouse game with someone who wants to kill the President.

As I said previously, Eastwood did very well. Even better is John Malkovich. I can't decide on who plays the better villain, Malkovich or Gary Oldman. But anyway, Malkovich is very creepy as the villain.

Overall, this is a top-notch thriller. There are plenty of action, thrills, and even a little romance. I rate this film 9/10."
Executive Decision (1996),"A fun, tense, and exciting action/thriller with an excellent ensemble cast, headed by Kurt Russell and including Halle Berry, David Suchet, and John Leguizamo.

Even Steven Seagal does a creditable job, mainly because this isn't a ""Steven Seagal movie."" His supporting role permits him to do what he does best (which isn't acting). He doesn't have to pretend to be witty, there's none of that awful smirking he does in a vain attempt to show emotion, the camera doesn't caress his body, and there's not one speech about how gol-dang *good* his character is. He even manages to enunciate his lines clearly!

The plot might have seemed a little far-fetched when the movie was released, but not anymore.

I'm not even much of an action film fan, but this one is really a lot of fun."
"Perfect World, A (1993)","An average story made good by quality acting. Kevin Costner turned in one of his best performances. Just as his character would start to win you over because of his positive interactions with the boy, he'd do something awful and remind you that he's really a bad guy and that he'd taken the boy hostage. So even though he's a criminal, he's got a good side and obviously his bad upbringing took him down the wrong path in life. I though TJ Lowther was also excellent as the boy and was very believable. On the other side is Clint Eastwood as the tough law man who cares more about catching his criminal than making his bosses happy. And last, but not least, Laura Dern was also very good as Clint's cohort in catching the bad guy. While Clint relies on his years of experience, she comes from the psychological side and what she's read in books. They often disagree, but there is a mutual respect between them even if they don't show it. There are enough light moments to keep this otherwise serious movie from being a turn off.

*** (Out of 4)"
McHale's Navy (1997),"Another rehash of vintage American television. (Some of it aged like fine Baron Philippe de Rothschild wine; however, most have turned to vinegar.) The humor, has become overtly anachronistic. This time around, MCHALE'S NAVY is in a late 1990's setting, with Tom Arnold at the helm. (He also co-produced). My first question was, why make the remake? The original series was amusing, but really not a landmark series. (I've seen a reel of out takes from the old series, which were hysterically funny, but in no way, shape or form would've made it on the air).

The only possible answer I could come up with, was trying to cash in on baby boomer sentiments. Well, it would seem the boomers are not quite THAT sentimental.

In a nutshell, this overlong, boring and painfully unfunny movie, was a waste of time for everyone on both sides of the screen. Tom Arnold has some genuine ability, and he was quite good in TRUE LIES. Why he has chosen some really, I mean excruciatingly bad, movie roles is beyond the scope of human imagination.

MCHALE'S NAVY should be avoided at all costs."
"Jackal, The (1997)","The fundamental problem with remakes is that you find yourself comparing the remake with the original . When watching THE JACKAL I found myself comparing American and European films . The original DAY OF THE JACKAL was a very European movie filmed entirely in Europe with a mainly European cast and crew with a very understated performance from Edward Fox as a very English assassin . It was a film that was both intelligent and compelling . The remake on the other hand - Despite having a Scottish director - is a very American film : Loud , vulgar , not very clever , with box office consideration over riding creative and artistic factors . You want a determined and ruthless assassin ? How about Jean Reno ? Ah but you can`t do that because the studio want a big name American actor like Bruce Willis in the title role , a role where his character has to don several disguises none of which make him look like anything more than Bruce Willis in a disguise ( A bit like Val Kilmer in THE SAINT where no matter how much the hero disguises himself he always looks like Val Kilmer ) And being an American film who better to play an IRA man than that well known wee , short , fat , middle aged Irish actor Richard Gere whose "" oirish "" accent is less convincing than the Jackal`s disguises . Once again this is the fault of the studio who are dying to cast a big name no matter how unsuitable they are for the role and once again I`m disgusted to see an IRA character as a good guy . Note to American film producers : By the 1990s most Irish Americans recognised the provisional IRA for what they are - Murdering scum . In fact one of the main reasons the IRA wanted to reach a settlement was because they`d lost all political and financial support from the Irish American lobby . The IRA had few friends over there then and have no friends over there now so stop making films with IRA characters hoping you`ll have a guaranteed hit in Boston and New York , it`s patronising to Irish Americans and offensive to us Brits

I do concede THE JACKAL is entertaining in parts and I did like the bizarre title sequence featuring a montage of 20th century Russian history set against a techno soundtrack , but it`s a very inferior film compared to the original . In fact I can`t help thinking the producers shot themselves in the foot by describing this as "" A remake "" because there`s very little common ground between the two except for the assassin plot . If you changed the name of The Jackal character to something else there`s very little chance Frederick Forsyth or anyone else would have sued for plagerism . As it is watching this Americanised version I found myself saying out loud "" The original was better . The original was better . The original ... """
Seven Years in Tibet (1997),"This biographical movie is about real-life Austrian (and Nazi) mountaineer Heinrich Harrar (Pitt) who is unfortunately scaling peaks in British India when WWII breaks out in 1939. Interred in a British POW camp he and his climbing companion (Thewlis) eventually escape and commence a tortuous travail through India into Tibet and all the way to the forbidden city of Lhasa. There the two men make friends, including the young Dali Lama, and find enlightenment.

The best thing about Seven Years in Tibet is the breathtaking high mountain scenery. How disappointing to learn the movie was shot in the Andes and not the Himalayas. The story is also compelling following Harrar as he morphs from selfish pig to generally nice guy. Unfortunately it's sometimes awkwardly told, and is over-long. And finally the use of English language dialogue as variously English, German, and Tibetan was as off-putting as Pitt's on-again, off-again German accent.

All in all a very ok film, not rip-off from the dollar bin."
Dark City (1998),"There was something very original about this film and it did not seem to fall into pathetic standard-plot twists and devices. It set out on a mission and stuck to it. I'd say that the film-makers would have been very happy with the finished ""product.""

But there were some shortcomings. First, I felt that Kiefer Sutherland was not quite right in this film. The agitated, rambling character was simply not right for an actor of his ability. It almost seemed forced and the inconsistency in Sutherland's efforts to press the nuances of his character were evident at times.

Second, I felt that there was too much of an attempt to unravel human behaviour. I appreciate that it was a sub-theme, but the film makers seemed to explore it without giving an insight or thorough reflection.

However, as far as sci-fi genre films go, this is way up there as it bursts with originality and moves at a modest pace - exploring the intricacies of the story line and providing a good build up, but was neither overly long nor rushed. Sits nicely along side Twelve Monkeys as one of the best in this genre for the past 20 years.

Filmed in Australia!"
"American President, The (1995)","US President Andrew Shepherd is a widower who was sweep into power on the back of great public sympathy. Three years into his presidency he meets and falls for Sydney Ellen Wade, an environmental lobbyist. Eventually they begin to date against the counsel of his advisors, giving his rivals (most notably Senator Rumson) and the media the ammunition they need to begin to attack his presidency.

This is not exactely a political thriller. In fact it is as far removed from reality as you could imagine. However that's the point, this film doesn't pretend to be anything other than a romantic comedy - it has some political wranglings but it is very far from the (still very tidy and clean) rule of Martin Sheen's President in TV's The West Wing. However the story is nicely handled and Rob Reiner is natually very good at this type of thing. Here it occasionally is far too sickly sweet and sentimental, but most of it works well.

Douglas is good in the lead and looks quite acceptable as the President of the US - lets be honest, if it was him or ""oil baron"" Bush who would you pick? Bening is also good as Sydney but neither have anything outside of the usual romantic leads to do. The real strength here is the supporting cast - both in terms of class and sheer enterainment value.To name a few - Sheen, MJ Fox, Mathis, Dreyfuss - all big names, all funny performances.

Overall this is a big sloppy romantic comedy, but it's done with so much class that it's hard not to like it. Not brillant, but very enjoyable all the same."
Persuasion (1995),"I watched this in a Jane Austen frenzie, after Pride and Prejudice BBC series, which of course might have affected my good judgement. The reason on which I was left unsatisfied with this Persuasion is Annes' character herself and the way they portrayed her. I thought she swapped between mental retardation and exaggerated eagerness... alongside with other moments of lack of decorum, for her time, in her interactions with the opposite sex, which supported my theory of desinhibited behavior. I have to say I haven't read the book and that Jane Austen really might have created a character that fits right into this description. However, I felt her lacking in depth of emotion to be a real Austn heroine, never really seeing much more than eagerness, with a sort of empty expression. She reminded me very much of Emily Watson in Breaking the waves, and you see where this leads me to, once more. The other characters I was happy with, especially her sisters and father. Some other reviewers said it would be hard not to drop a tear, but really, I am such a hearthrob and my face was always dry! I guess I might give it another shot someday. And what kind of ending was that?"
Kicking and Screaming (1995),"Feeling unprepared for the 'real world', four recent college graduates spend their time philosophising and avoiding taking action in this feature film debut from Noah Baumbach. The film features witty, memorable dialogue left, right and centre as one friend reckons ""I've begun reminiscing events before they even occur"", while another comments ""I feel like I'm being poisoned"" if a bartender at a bar does not drink with him, and the list goes on. There is also some quite pointed in how unprepared the foursome are for the real world despite their extensive education, unleashed into the world like a baby not wanting to be born, as the title suggests. None of the characters are, however, particularly likable for all of their witticisms and at times thought-provoking conversations. The foursome actually come across as more lazy than scared or ill-prepared for post-college life, and none of them have especially vibrant personalities either. The brightest moments in the film are, in fact, had by Elliott Gould as the far too open father of the foursome, sharing his experiences with using condoms at his age and finding love post-marriage separation, much to the disgust of his son. The film does tap into something interesting though as the foursome come to realise that they feel ""pressure ... to remain friends"" post-graduation. This more than anything else captures how microcosmic college life is often considered to be and how different the actual world is. It's a different, inevitable phase of life involving a big transition indeed comparable to birth."
City Hall (1996),"Being a huge fan of Al Pacino (from the likes of 'Heat', the 'Godfather' movies, and 'Dog Day Afternoon' especially) and having had a huge crush on Bridget Fonda ('Single White Female', anyone?) back in the day (Peter Fonda's famous daughter was named 85th sexiest star in film history, and Mrs. Danny Elfman hasn't been involved in film, unfortunately, since 2002), I was hugely disappointed in this film, especially since I had loved director Harold Becker's previous 'Sea of Love', which also starred Pacino. The first half was decent and involving, but it kind of slid off the rails, interest-wise for me, the rest of the way and got too talky and uninspired.

I don't really know if the problem was with the script or its direction. I know I'm not the greatest John Cusack fan in the world (I find he's much better in comedy, like his sister Joan), but he had pretty good co-stars, whose talents were basically wasted, in Martin Landau, Anthony Franciosa and Danny Aiello (these guys were BORN for these roles and films, so on paper, this should have really worked out well). I had always wondered why this film had bombed so miserably, and now I know why. In cases like this, more should have been done to alter the story arc, just some basic tweaks, to make it more suspenseful and/or (though I usually balk at such 'Hollywood' tendencies) some romantic tension (a beauty such as Fonda's was misused--they may as well have hired someone else). All in all, a wasted opportunity that's worth a look if you like dramas about corruption--just don't go in with big expectations, and don't bother with a re-watch."
"Basketball Diaries, The (1995)","Acting: The cast was great, it consists of people that will later on be known as A listers. The acting was done right and let's you feel for the characters your watching. Whether its happiness all the way to sadness. It has well developed characters and it's not hard to relate to them.

Cinematography: Pretty decent camera shots and quality of film especially for the time. Every shot and scene seems to be done with meaning and purpose.

Story: This being based of a true story makes it even more of a hit to the gut. From beginning to end its filled with interesting characters and story. You follow a group of boys through good times, funny moments and then as their lives start to crumble further into the story so does your mood and hope for their future. This is definitely a emotional story that builds up and shows hardships Leo's character faces. It includes pedophilia, drug addiction, loss of friendship, death and more. The end was nice but ended quite suddenly and randomly. Some parts in the film did seem a bit unrealistic as well. But overall the story hit hard and was done well.

Summary: This film tells a emotional tale of some hard times kids can face in life. It's not the best I've seen. But for me it definitely was a really good movie. I would highly suggest it if your into your emotional movies. 7.5/10 for me."
"Browning Version, The (1994)","I got this out one wet Sunday afternoon hoping for an inspirational school drama along the lines of ""To sir with love"" or ""Dead poets society""-- something to moisten my eyes and make me think anything was possible. Boy was I wrong -- this muddling drama, which covers the last days of an old masters career at an English public school, was depressing from beginning to end. As each element of the masters tragic life was revealed to me, I kept wondering when the turn-around point would be. Surely this entire movie was not just going to be the telling of the sad life of an uninteresting man and an ineffective teacher -- surely there would be some rising climax to contrast the woe. But no! For the final speech scene which I hung on for, the master turned out the most embarrassing self pitying display I have ever seen on film -- something like my grandfather when he's had too many drinks at Christmas. Of course, the teachers and students dutifully applauded, shouted and stomped (to indicate to the viewer that this was indeed the climax) but I was just thought he was an old fool. There were admittedly some nice insights into human behavior and relationships and some good English upper-class mocking (tea and cricket chaps!) but the other characters never seemed to develop as if to save room for the central story. Unfortunately, the sad old teacher didn't developed beyond self-pity throughout the entire movie, leaving me with the definite impression that he ""..got what he deserved, no more and certainly no less""."
Little Women (1994),"With their father away fighting in the Civil War, Joe, Meg, Beth and Amy grow up with their mother in somewhat reduced circumstances. They are a close family who inevitably have their squabbles and tragedies. But the bond holds even when, later, men friends start to become a part of the household.

If you haven't read the book, you might enjoy this slow-moving, wholesome film. However, if you have read the book, do yourself a favor and do not see this film. You will be greatly disappointed.

This is one of those movies where the book was far better than the movie. Quite disappointing. The movie moved very slow and did not hold or grab me as a watcher. They really downplayed the richness and colorfulness of the characters and it was not dramatic, funny or that entertaining. It totally missed the mark, and it shouldn't have.

Filmmakers have been able to capture the spirit of Jane Austen's novels in a wonderful way, however, this can not be compared to that. It's like comparing apples and oranges. The classiness, humor, drama and entertainment of the novel is not portrayed in this film."
"Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl, The (1993)","This is a very competently assembled documentary about one of the greatest artist film makers: Leni Riefenstahl.

That this documentary is necessary at all is down to her association with the vilest and most evil regimes in history: Hitler & the Nazis.

The documentary maker, Müller, does not hold back in showing us - and by extension Riefenstahl herself - what she did, what her involvement was in Germany in the 1930s. Similarly, Müller tries to hold Riefenstahl to account. It's interesting to watch the 90-year-old pushing back and holding to the line that she's always held: that she was never a party member, never a true believer. Watch this documentary and see what you think.

There's no question that, seen through today's eyes, Triumph of the Will (TotW), and Olympia can be seen as propaganda. However, the former film won top awards before the war for its innovative techniques and imagery. The art is there. The films weren't seen as propaganda in 1938.... The problem, for Riefenstahl, is that these films are seen as propaganda NOW.

The other problem is that these two films are just too good as innovative art-in-cinema. In this documentary, it comes through that Riefenstahl wishes she hadn't made TofW. All of her (probably well-rehearsed) protestations about not knowing or realising what Hitler was are acceptable. As a matter of fact, Riefenstahl made no further ""propaganda"" films after Olympia (1936-38). If she had been a committed follower, then she would have made dozens of films for the Nazis 1936-45. Others did (e.g Veit Harlan). But she didn't. This suggests to me that there is a large element of truth in what she says here.

She was appalled by what she saw in Poland in 1939. This also moved her strongly away from wanting to make films for the regime.

Riefenstahl fell out badly with the Nazi authorities. She states that even as early as 1934, Goebbels hated her - and he was in control of the Nazi propaganda industry. She clearly was a strong minded artist who refused to be seduced or controlled.

The pity of it all is that Riefenstahl was pilloried and rejected after the war and made no further major contributions to cinema. In this documentary, we sense her regret - but we also sense that she is prepared to stand and justify her pre-war work. She cannot, even many years after the events, be separated from her art, even though many have identified her as a Nazi sympathiser because of it.

This documentary is about an hour too long - but then perhaps it has to be? Riefenstahl is a strong and compelling person.

A good documentary about a very remarkable film maker."
Barcelona (1994),"""Barcelona"" is a bizarre film that captures your attention through the fast-paced repertoire, but looses you through unfocused political jargon that doesn't seem important, but is obviously an instrumental part of the film. This is where the struggle occurs for this film. It is an internal struggle because of the popularity of ""Metropolitan"" you want to enjoy this film, feel that brush of fresh air, and laugh at what others would consider ""intelligent banter"", but even with the subtle humor between Eigeman and Nichols there is something missing that connects the crucial plot elements together. Stillman has created another valuable film, but it feels more like he was trying to reproduce the excitement of ""Metropolitan"" than create a new voice.

One cannot argue that Wit Stillman's style of film-making is still seen throughout modern cinema culture. While watching ""Barcelona"", there was this eerie feeling of watching ""The Darjeeling Limited"" again. Stillman's voice can be found in nearly all Wes Anderson films, the witty conversation, the intellectual characters, and the thin layer of plot are Stillman's characteristics seen today. Take ""Margo at the Wedding"", Baumback uses Stillman with honor and respect, and can even been better seen in Baumback's early ""Kicking and Screaming"". The key difference between these modern directors and Stillman's ""Barcelona"" is that they develop both plot and characters. Stillman's visual technique, his ability to capture the sense of normality, and control of the language is powerful in this film, but an apathetic feel for Ted and Fred, coupled with a lack of focus  pushed ""Barcelona"" from challenging second film to average sophomoric effort. From a sales perspective, Ted and Fred couldn't persuade me to do anything, much less follow them around. Their jovial voice and constant bickering would amuse at first, but like the film became annoying near the end. From a character standpoint, Ted (Taylor Nichols) was enjoyable to watch. He felt like the stuck-in-sales type of guy that others could relate to. Aside from the religious dance scene (continuing with the unfocused plot idea), he was the quintessential hero of this film. Fred (Christopher Eigeman) covers the other end of the spectrum entirely. There was no belief that he was a Navy officer, his constant lying and possible theft (again  that kayaking scene that lead ultimately nowhere) just created an annoying character that tried to be funny, but never was. There was this sense that Eigeman didn't understand he and Nichols' character relationship. One needs to ask, was Nichols' stutter part of the character, or just Stillman's lack of editing? Finally, what was Mira Sorvino doing here? Her accent was thicker than pea soup, yet as unbelievable as pea soup finding its way into a Whit Stillman film.

The obscurity of the actors leading us through this political comedy/drama, was a tough nail to bite, but the tougher one was the overall plot of this film. Stillman's goal was to make humor out of an odd anti-American culture in Spain. His actors, as mentioned, tried to bring the humor, but it was up to Stillman to bring us the connectors and overall themes of ""Barcelona"". It is this area that I felt Stillman was at his weakest. While the actors were not quite the caliber of Stillman's original effort, they at least made me chuckle and think of Wes Anderson's films, but I felt forced and confused by where Stillman was headed with the camera. The bomb at the beginning seemed passé, the anti-Americanism comments seemed less real  Stillman never quite secured the feel of realism with this film. Our two characters walk down the street, talk-back to those who oppose them, and show less emotion when the dramatic ending takes place  there just wasn't that sense of fear. This felt insulting. Stillman's eye in this film felt bored, stale, and unenergetic. This needs to be a stand alone film for Stillman, but I found myself comparing it to ""Metropolitan"" constantly. This film was missing that freshness, or that sense of excitement, and that desire to see the unknown. The relationships were bland, the characters were humorous  but un-follow-able, and the story itself felt forced. This wasn't Stillman's greatest outing. He made some choices that didn't translate well onto the bigger screen. The colors even tired my eyes  it just wasn't the film I expected, or wanted, from Stillman.

Overall, ""Barcelona"" was a second outing for Whit Stillman, but it wasn't the caliber of ""Metropolitan"". This film felt old, used, and un-welcomed in Stillman's repertoire of characters and language. There was plenty of potential, but it went unused with people like Mira Sorvino attempting to capture the essence of a Spanish woman. Again, I want to state that this film had some very funny moments that were as dry as any martini one could hope for. It had my laughing, but it wasn't enough. I wanted a detailed story, I wanted some of the issues about being a salesman come out clearer, and I wanted that random scene of religion and dancing to carry more gumption. ""Barcelona"" felt as if Stillman would start ideas, but never quite complete them. This film reminded me of Kevin Smith's early work. Using the same actors, Smith would attempt to recreate the same characters in different environments with mixed results. The power and honesty of Smith's ""Clerks"" could never be recreated and thus the doomed ""Clerks II"" will never reach cult status. That analogy could be used for Stillman's ""Barcelona"". He tried, but there is a reason this film wasn't nominated for the best screenplay category  it just felt elusive and incomplete.

Grade: *** (hesitantly) out of *****"
Widows' Peak (1994),"Nowadays,nine movies out of ten feature two male actors as the leads.For a change,""Widows Peak' boasts three actresses at the top of the bill.And what a threesome:Mia Farrow,a spinster,the Cinderella of a bunch of posh and distinguished ladies whose queen is none other than Joan Plowright.This wealthy widow ,with her hoity-toity ways, annoys anyone and all,including her son,a would be handy man,actually a big ninny,always tied to his mother's apron strings,although he firmly denies it.Enter Richardson,who plays a beautiful English widow,and Plowright would like her offspring to marry this rich heiress.A mortal feud begins between Farrow and Richardson.But things are not what they seem and prepare yourself for a lot of unexpected twists,till the very end.And you'll dig such witty lines as (the ironical lawyer to Plowright)""your real treasure is the love of your son"".

More than the shrewd plot,the everyday life of the little community is exquisitely depicted:the film (excerpts of De Mille's ""ten commandments""(1923,of course!)during which Plowright is enjoying sweets,the mass on Sunday morning,the local dance during which Farrow and Richardson fight for... two tickets for King Vidor' s ""the big parade"",the regatta,the only time Plowright's son feels manly.

An user regrets James Ivory did not direct it.One would probably have a better movie,for sure.The characters -particularly the lady and her son- verge on caricature. But anyway,watch it,if you like great actresses."
"House of the Spirits, The (1993)","Saw 'House of the Spirits' for two primary reasons, regardless of its less than great critical reception. One was for Isabel Allende's incredible book that it is based on, one of my favourites for its richness and emotional impact, did have my concerns as to knowing how difficult to adapt it would be. The other was for the cast with some immensely talented actors and actresses. Did think to myself, it is hard to go wrong with Meryl Streep, Glenn Close, Jeremy Irons, Vanessa Redgrave, Winona Ryder and Antonio Banderas.

Didn't think that 'House of the Spirits' was that bad, but it should have been so much better. It is severely underwhelming as an adaptation, with so much left out, so much simplified and with changes that don't make sense, confirming my worries of it being one of those books that should be left alone and doesn't translate well to film. It would have been much better as a mini-series of at least 6 one-hour parts. Actually also think though that one doesn't need to have read the book to be disappointed, as 'House of the Spirits' has noticeable flaws on its own terms.

There are good things here. 'House of the Spirits' looks fantastic for starters. Especially the majestic scenery and elegant interiors of the family home, all gorgeously photographed. The costumes are evocative enough and the make-up is more than convincing, with Irons especially unrecognisable as an older man. Hans Zimmer's score fits beautifully with a haunting main theme that's still in my mind. Found the last forty five minutes, with the portrayal of the revolution and the brutality it brought, or so both harrowing and moving, it is also the portion of the film where there are the most signs of a plot.

Of the cast, only Banderas passes as a Chilean in terms of how they look and speak and the accents waver from trying too hard (Irons) to not even attempting one (Ryder). Regardless of that, most do their best with what they have and do capably. Irons especially as the most, and only, properly interesting and richly drawn character gives his all and dominates the film, maybe too much to the point of hamminess in some of the earlier portions of the film where Esteban is pretty much irredeemably detestable (much of the time he is chilling). But when older and more repentent he is much more subtle, whether speaking or conveying a lot while saying little to nothing, yet manages to be authoritative and oddly affecting. On a side note he reunited with director Billie August twenty years later for 'Night Train to Lisbon', did find that a better film and preferred his performance in that despite the character being less complex, am writing this much about him because there is also much to say about Esteban and in a way he is the main character.

Streep is graceful and epitomises pathos as Clara, especially later on and although they didn't create the same magic as they did so well in 'The French Lieutenant's' Woman' her chemistry with Irons is sincerely done. Close has too little to do but is appropriately sympathetic yet stern. Banderas is dashing and Redgrave and Armin Mueller-Stahl make much of their limited screen time. Vincent Gallo is chilling in his small role and Grace Gummer (real life daughter of Streep) and Sasha Hanau are adorable without being saccharine as young Clara and Alba, Hanau especially.

Excepting the final forty five minutes or so where she is quite powerful and some nice chemistry with Irons, Ryder for me was the cast's weak link as she came over as out of place and too modern in looks and how she spoke (which tended to be too much of one-note)

Although as an adaptation 'House of the Spirits' is too short, the book doesn't translate too well as a two and a half hour film. Somehow the film, and it is the storytelling that dooms the film, feels dull with too much of a pedestrian pace and dramatically it feels anaemic and thin and uneventful in spots with any emotional power only coming out in spurts. With the abrupt jumps in time and the disjointed feel of the scenes and events following on from each other and so many plot strands and characters, 'House of the Spirits' can be very jumpy and hard to follow. Even telling who was who was confusing at first, especially for those who have read the book.

Found the character development bland to barely there, only Esteban shows signs of developing and believably. The character interaction is not always natural and could be static, particularly in the early parts, much isn't gone into anywhere near enough depth and the dialogue is trite and stilted. Particularly early on and in the heavy-handedly handled political-oriented moments. August took on an ambitious task and it proved to be too over-ambitious, he succeeds when it comes to the visuals but he fails in making the drama compelling or emotionally investable. For so much content crammed in for two and a half hours, 'House of the Spirits' did feel oddly bloated, despite so much left out and simplified, and like it tried to do too much.

Concluding, watchable film but underwhelming considering the amount of potential it had. 5/10"
Singin' in the Rain (1952),"I'm going to confine my comments about ""Singin' in the Rain"" to the ""Broadway Rhythm"" sequence where Cyd Charisse steals the movie without saying a word. In my view, Charisse, who is still gorgeous at 83, was the quintessential movie dancer of the 1950s. Her height, elegance, aloofness and those impossibly long legs -- along with an uncanny ability to match her style to that of her partner -- makes watching her dance a mesmerizing experience.

Many have said that the two numbers in ""Singin' in the Rain"" that feature Charisse probably belong in another movie. I don't know as the flapper in jade, she sexes up Kelly's rube character to a steamy height unusual in movies of that era. In a dance full of wonderful moves, my favorite comes after she's left him with her cigarette holder. She sashays away from him, blowing on her nails in studied boredom. She's gotten some distance away, and as she tosses her right hand back, he throws down the cigarette holder, grabs her hand and brings her flying up to his chest, where she proceeds to slide down Kelly's thigh to the floor for one of several prone positions she takes during this duet, from which she returns to a standing position with amazing grace. I'm not wild about dances that rely heavily on props, but this one does so very effectively: they're amusing and they reinforce character.

And thank heaven for the artistic control that allowed Kelly to keep the ""crazy veil"" number in the picture. Charisse has discussed that dance, where she got to show off her early ballet training, most charmingly for a ""Word of Mouth"" feature on TCM. She and others have noted over the years that the wind machines required to keep that impossibly long veil moving and undulating between and above her and Kelly made filming a nightmare. But it looks effortless, on a set that is a subtle optical illusionnot as deep nor as sloped as it appears to be.

Both dances end the same way. Whether she's a cheap gangster's moll in garish green or a Grecian goddess in white, less obviously in a mobster's sway, Charisse is invariably lured back to reality by proffered baubles and menacingly tossed coins. But at the end of the crazy veil number, she's the one tossing the coins.

Wonderful."
Enchanted April (1991),"There's a breath of spring feeling about ENCHANTED APRIL--nothing deep, just a story of four women who want to escape from it all, share a villa in Italy, and find that the enchanted environment brings about small changes in each one of them in a positive manner.

MIRANDA RICHARDSON is the quiet housewife who seems to think her husband is bored with her; POLLY WALKER is a pretty socialite who wants to be admired for more than her beauty; JOAN PLOWBRIGHT is a crotchety older woman who learns to appreciate friendship when it's offered; and JOSIE LAWRENCE is the rather scatterbrained, almost eccentric woman who is unsure about her marriage until she invites her husband (JIM BROADBENT) to the charming place in the country where she feels nothing but good vibes. MICHAEL KITCHEN is the owner of the villa who falls for Richardson, thinking she's a widow, but then finds consolation with the pretty socialite who appreciates that he didn't warm up to her on the basis of her looks alone (he's nearsighted).

Most humorous aspect of the story is the relationship between Walker and her hubby, ALFRED MOLINA, whose relaxing bath turns into one of the films only ""explosive"" moments when he fails to understand Italian and the meaning of the word for dangerous.

It's a simple tale, woven tightly together by the four strands of storytelling, and passes the time pleasantly enough even though there are times when nothing seems to be happening. The pace is very slow, even for a film with a running time of little more than an hour and thirty minutes, so it's not a tale for every taste. It's a quietly reflective character study of perfect strangers learning about each other.

Nicely photographed in Italian locations, it's visually pleasing and easy to take, but really nothing special happens here."
"Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)","The film itself is about sex and all its consequences as an instrument of pleasure, power, philosophical, etc. Here sex, be it the act or its simple verbalization, is the way for the self discovery of the four central characters, whether destroying or resuming social relations, sex is always the starting point for the development of the plot and the inhabitants of that particular world . What is striking is that in a movie about sex it is never explicit, which demonstrates the incredible genius of filmmaker Steven Soderbergh in his first feature ... All the technical aspects were orchestrated in the right measure, music, editing, sound, they are all examples of how to do something subtle and powerful, the highlight being the light design, the first sight for anyone who doubts the capacity of the film's cinematography, because it is not an explosion of colors, but it is subtly grand, better than adjectives and remembering the scene in which the two sisters confront each other at a distance, one looks like an angel wrapped in peaceful white, while the other is in an infernal red environment, this is how to develop characters.

It is worth mentioning the small cast, as everyone is stupendous and convincing in the role of people, that if under bad interpretations they would be false."
Strictly Ballroom (1992),"Before ""Dancing with the Stars,"" there was ""Strictly Ballroom,"" a 1992 Australian film written and directed by Baz Luhrmann and starring Paul Mercurio, Tara Morice, Bill Hunter and the late Pat Thomson, who died before the film was released.

There's not much of a story - it's about an innovative dancer, Scott Hastings (Mercurio) whose parents (Thomson and Barry Otto) run a dance studio. The beginning is done in documentary style as his mother, Janet Leigh on crack, relates, her voice trembling with emotion, that it's Scott's year to win the Pan Pacific Grand Prix dance competition. Unfortunately, during the regionals, he broke out and did non-sanctioned steps, and his partner deserted him. This is all treated with the seriousness of a brain operation, which makes the film even more hilarious. A nerdy girl named Fran approaches Scott in the studio and asks to partner with him. He gives her a chance, and then needs to make a decision - win the Pan Pacific or do his own thing on the dance floor. On the way to the competition, some family secrets are revealed, and he and Fran fall in love.

Told with hilarity, poignancy, and beautiful dancing, this is one of the all-time great dance films with Mercurio's electrifying moves, hot body, and good looks raising it to a very high level. Luhrmann's fast-paced and creative direction makes the film fly by. Some of the photography is spectacular: dancing in front of the neon Coca-Cola sign, Scott learning the paso doble from Fran's relatives as a train passes by, a kiss at twilight, and the color-mad, cartoon-like flashback scene near the end of the film. The dance sequences themselves are fabulous, with the outrageous costumes, wild hair and beautiful steps.

All of the performances are good, but my favorite by far is Thomson as a former ballroom star who puts on her ""happy face"" though her heart is breaking, i.e., Scott doesn't have a partner, Scott won't dance the correct steps - her constant near hysterics and overly dramatic concern are fantastic.

The undertone of the film concerns the slimy, toupeed head of the regulatory committee Barry Fife (Hunter) who wants ballroom dance to remain conservative and by the book. Given the interior battles in the ice dancing arena, it wouldn't surprise me if such a thing exists in ballroom as well. No selfish, crowd-pleasing steps! Just make it -strictly ballroom. If you've never seen this gem, go out and get it."
"Substance of Fire, The (1996)","I saw this movie just recently and was certainly disappointed ... not that I was expecting a masterpiece either but it was sooooooo long and uninteresting I nearly fell asleep at the 2/3's point ...

A whole lot of pointless dialogues going round and round ... discussions about some old book that we don't care for anyway ... annoying characters on the screen (like the author of that Holocaust book that made me cringe 10 times at least during the movie wishing he would shut up and stop whining about everything from the coffee he was drinking to the editors he was meeting) ...

The stubborn old man in the lead was also quite boring (not too mention hard headed) and then last part of the movie where he finally goes off his rockers (big surprise, pretty clear from the get go this guy has serious ""issues"" !) for good is really bad ... lots of scenes that made me think ""oh, come on"" and wish I could slap the old dude back into reality at once... or maybe send him to an asylum ...

I couldn't wait for this ""thing"" to end ... 1.5/5"
Othello (1995),"I just watched the full length version of the play, televised by BBC in 1981 with Anthony Hopkins in the title role of Othello and Bob Hoskins playing Iago. It made me realize just how much the Fishburne/Branagh version from 1995 suffers by being cut to ribbons to fit in a much shorter time slot. The director finds time for sex scenes but leaves out scenes that are vital to fully understanding the background and the relationships and what is going on.

The film is good, but should have been longer. Laurence Fishburne is good in the title role but not incredible, and again, he is missing some of his best lines due to editing. Irene Jacob is a bit weak as Desdemona and I do think it may have to do with English not being her native tongue. Kenneth Branagh as Iago virtually steals every scene he is in. He is just delicious. Fortunately he is in most of the scenes. He is evil even when he is about to make love to his wife, perhaps not in a way that she would like at all, from what I could tell.

See it but then see one of the versions that does not have so much text cut out."
Carrington (1995),"It is difficult for the average person to appreciate what is going on in this film. Nora Carrington, a painter, loved Lytton Stachey, the famous essayist, with complete devotion. But, because of his homosexuality, he could return only a spiritual love. Though he wanted to marry her, he never did, apparently to leave her free to find a normal life with another man. And while she did marry, her love for Stachey overrided any affection she had for her husband or any of her other lovers.

It must be very difficult for most people to understand the love relationship between these two people. Only those who have encountered or experienced a similar love could understand it.

I found this film very rewarding. My main criticism is the choppy editing which abruptly flits from one scene or even one location to the next. The acting of Emma Thomson and Jonathan Pryce is quite good. Pryce's role particularly is a departure from his usual work. I had trouble recognizing him because of the makeup.

The film has tweaked my interest in pursuing more of this real-life story."
To Die For (1995),"Nicole Kidman is right on target in this notable dark comedy, an adaptation of the Joyce Maynard novel which was itself inspired by a notorious real life story. Nicole, looking absolutely ravishing throughout, is a completely self-serving sociopath named Suzanne Stone who's simply hellbent on achieving her personal American dream of being a TV personality. When she realizes that her nice guy husband Larry (Matt Dillon, in a solid change of pace performance) is going to be an obstacle in her path, she turns on the heat and convinces dumb as dirt, lovelorn teenager Jimmy Emmett (Joaquin Phoenix, in his breakthrough performance) to bump off Larry. She then proceeds to play to the media to her hearts' content.

22 years later, this film version remains pretty damn relevant, in the era of reality television where just about any person can become a celebrity for no really good reason, and fame & fortune is still seen as a worthwhile goal. Working from a screenplay by actor Buck Henry, director Gus Van Sant gives us a thoroughly absorbing film with a fair amount of ideas to mull over. Just like any good dark comedy, it's funny in a twisted sort of way. I'm sure some people who've followed the story, or read the book, or seen the movie, must know one or more people like Suzanne Stone.

An exceptional cast full of familiar faces is the real drawing card: Phoenix, Casey Affleck as his degenerate ""friend"", Alison Folland as the awkward girl who hangs out with the two of them, Dan Hedaya and Maria Tucci as Larry's parents, Kurtwood Smith and Holland Taylor as Suzannes' folks, Tim Hopper and Michael Rispoli as investigating detectives, Wayne Knight as the manager of a local TV station, and especially Illeana Douglas as Larry's sister, a cynical sort who has Suzanne pegged right early on. Making cameo appearances are author Maynard (as Suzannes' lawyer), screenwriter Henry (as a huffy teacher), and filmmaker David Cronenberg as the mysterious man at the lake. Kidman is a marvel as she really struts her stuff for the camera.

Ultimately, one does feel somewhat sorry for Jimmy when it's seen just how pathetic he really is. He's just one of many characters who get jerked around by Suzanne, a master manipulator if ever there was one.

Eight out of 10."
Home for the Holidays (1995),"Such a sardonic and sarcastic tone to set for any movie! I am embarrassed to even admit that I was born in the US. I lived through the 1990's, and I was too ""immersed"" in the culture to see it. But now that I'm older and more mature... To think that within my lifetime that the US culture would sink to such a low point. And it still continues...

Aside from my rantings and ravings, I do feel that Jody Foster did an above average job making this movie come together. The reality is that this does capture very well the mood and spirit of the times, even if it is a farcical account through a distorted lens. And because of this, it may bring some kind of spiritual awareness so that we don't have to go there. ""CAUTION -- this could happen to you if you don't take greater ownership to bring more loving and acceptance into your family and extended family!!""

Sometimes, it got so crazy that I had to laugh. The lines were sometimes very clever. All of the actors/actresses did a good job. The only thing that got in the way for me was that it was so obvious that RDJ was hopped up on something. It kind of ruined it for me. The horrible negativity brought about by abusing drugs has cost us, as a country, more than we would ever imagine or admit. I have observed it firsthand, and that's why I'm able to share this. Regardless of this, I say, ""Thank you, Jody Foster."" I have always admired you and the work that you have done in your life and career!"
"Juror, The (1996)","Alec Baldwin comes on quoting from the Tao Te Ching, making me think he's my kind of anti hero. He's urban, sophisticated and seemingly very safe since he's an art curator, or seems to be. Demi Moore as Annie Laird, a gifted and original sculptor (she sculpts works of art that you feel with your hands by reaching up into them: it's all tactile), is thrilled when he offers to buy her work and sell it to the Japanese. Wow. She has arrived as an artist.

Thus we have an intriguing and original premise for a thriller. One almost wishes that there weren't this little matter of her agreeing to serve on the jury in the case of a Mafia boss on trial for murder..

I will gloss over the excellent, if unlikely, plot since it would be preemptive to reveal any of it, and concentrate on Demi Moore who is gorgeous, strange and riveting.

It might seem impossible to give an 'heroic' performance in a thriller, since the point of a thriller is pure entertainment, but this movie manages to look into the nature of good and evil a bit more than most, and Moore plays her part like our dream of a true heroine. Her character has strength and cunning; she's sharp without pretension. I always thought Moore was better than her reputation, but somehow she always seemed a little on the not entirely bright side, the kind of actress who would never presume to play Shakespeare. But now I think she's a 'natural,' like a gifted athlete-I'd almost say an 'animal'-as an actress, which is probably why some people don't like her. She can project the beautiful woman, an ordinary woman, or herself as a matronly woman with just a turn of her head. She can display a wide range of emotions and be, by turns, both a masculine and a feminine entity; but she is not androgynous. The role she plays here is, in a sense, the feminine counterpart of many Harrison Ford roles, the ordinary person elevated to heroic action by compelling circumstances. I would not say that Demi Moore is a great actress, but she is close, and I could be wrong.

Alec Baldwin combines megalomania with a seductive cynicism. He fills the screen with his presence like something you can't get rid of. He is so compelling you want to push him away or just give up. And he is charming-evil, but charming.

Brian Gibson's direction is unobtrusive and clever, and he pays attention to detail. The script is relatively free of the implausibilities that usually mar the genre, and the editing is crisp without jarring. The story practically transcends the genre by making us feel the evil of violent crime and how it perverts society, the sort of revelation not usually attempted in a thriller. I was especially delighted to see the Mafia demeaned and defeated, even if it's only by a new breed of international criminal. This is a superior thriller.

In the Bleak Midwinter (1995),"Branagh made this around the same time he made Hamlet, and released it just beforehand. It's a movie entirely about directing a production of ""Hamlet"". He knew his subject, at any rate ... In fact, this film is a good deal better, and certainly more heartfelt, than the ""Hamlet"" that followed it. It's hard to know why this should be. Branagh is almost invariably brilliant. His previous Shakespeare movies were the best of their kind. I presume it's more or less impossible to care about directing ""Hamlet"" without caring about ""Hamlet"" itself. Yet there we have it: Branagh's ""Hamlet"" is just a tad soulless, while his film about how to perform Hamlet in the face of overwhelming odds is heart-warming, and crackles with energy. (You'll note that there was an omen. The performance we see of ""Hamlet"" in this movie, although it moves the audience, is dreadful, and belongs to the ""let's put Shakespeare's play in any setting but the correct one"" school of thought.)

A number of people - including those I saw the film with - complain about this or that cliche. These complaints strike me as being misguided. Is it a cliche to have the production threatened? Maybe; but any movie about people fulfilling a quest would be senseless if there was no danger of them failing to fulfil it. Is it a cliche to have actors fight each other behind the scenes? In a sense; but I fail to see how any but the dullest of films could result if they didn't. In short, these kinds of complaints are complaints against the necessary mechanisms of the play about a play. If they were just they would damn everything in the entire genre. People who make such complaints MAY be saying that in this instance Branagh presented all the necessary elements without verve, or boringly, or something of that kind; but then the charge is just obviously false.

By the way ... I'd like to protest against the use of the inferior title, ""A Midwinter's Tale"", in Australia (and, I gather, in the USA). ""In the Bleak Midwinter"" says it better. I trust Branagh himself had nothing to do with the change."
Nine Months (1995),"This 1995 comedy-romance is a reflection of the mores by the late 20th century in America, especially the metropolitan scene. The lead characters are an unmarried couple, Samuel and Rebecca, who have been living together for five years. They have good careers and enjoy life together. They have frequent sex and practice contraception because they haven't wanted to have children.

They say they are in love. So far, they have liked the arrangement that might be spoiled if they were to marry. But seeing children in other families, Rebecca asks Samuel if he wouldn't like to have more in life. Samuel has been content and doesn't want to have to change. When she gets pregnant, their lives do change.

""Nine Months"" has a mixture of comedy and seriousness. But, much of the comedy and some of the dialog is crude or crass. Hugh Grant plays Samuel and Julianne Moore is Rebecca. Tom Arnold, as Marty Dwyer, is the source of much of the crudity of this film. The guy seems to play those roles mostly. What little humor he may add is lost due to his loud and crude antics and dialog. He's a brother-in-law of a mutual friend, Sean Fletcher, played by Jeff Goldblum.

The movie has a fine outcome as Samuel changes and is changed by the new life in their lives. Robin Williams has a comedy part as a Russian doctor, and he vies with Arnold for crudity with his dialog. Joan Cusack is a balancing character in the film, with some humor and sense, as Marty's wife, Gail.

This film is about finding more in life beyond the sensual pleasures which are self-centered. Rebecca wants more than that, and, in time, Samuel wants it with her. So, he sheds his selfishness. Some people really don't want more in life, so they wouldn't enjoy this type of film. As Sean says, he may wind up all alone in the end. But he'll just keep on going and adjust his attitude to take his mind off of it."
Boys on the Side (1995),"Great movie about three women (Whoppi Goldberg, Mary-Louise Parker, Drew Barrymore) and their various adventures as they travel cross-country. Goldberg plays a lesbian, Parker plays a straight woman with AIDS and Barrymore a pregnant, unwed woman. All three are fantastic and the film manages (more or less) to juggle many plot elements (AIDS, lesbianism, pregnancy, drugs, violence, murder etc etc) and deal with them all effectively.

Parker is probably the first woman ever to play a straight woman with AIDS in a major Hollywood film--quite a feat. Goldberg and Barrymore are just letter perfect in their roles. Also the unknown Matthew McConaughey (absolutely gorgeous with a buff body and blue eyes blazing) and Estelle Parsons (as Parker's mother) give strong supporting performances. The film is long but never dull and it all ends to a very moving final sequence--I cry every time I see it!

Two minor quibbles--it takes Barrymore over a year to have her baby and there are obvious cuts in the second half of the movie (I assume this was to keep the film down to two hours). But these are minor problems. A very funny, very moving film. Don't miss it!"
Circle of Friends (1995),"Although this movie lacked any sort of plot, and was forever flitting from one insignificant scene to the next, I was willing to watch it because of the fine acting performance by Minnie Driver and that there seemed to be a story shaping-up between her character and that of Chris O'Donnell's. When he left Bene sitting for almost the entire time of his party, opting to dance with her glamorous friend, instead, I should have been warned.

When this cad (Jack) actually tried and succeeded in getting Bene to dance as she was about to leave, I should have realized the black nature of this script and screenplay. When Jack has coitus with the glamorous friend (played by Saffron Burroughs) and gets her pregnant (he is told), he decides to tell Bene, whom he has, by then, some real affection for. As he is getting off the bus or trolley to meet her, tell her and break her heart, I turned the movie off and threw it out. A film really has to offend me for me to score fewer than 7 stars. No real plot and an apparent delight in hurting those vulnerable means a cinematic failure to me, even with Minnie Driver's memorable character and performance. The fact that Circle of Friends was based on a novel is no excuse. Another one should have been used. A fresh and compelling screenplay could have been developed, loosely using the characters of Bene and Jack. Certainly, this movie was talent wasted."
Exit to Eden (1994),"i saw this film many years ago and have since mostly tried to block it out the memories of it. Unfortunately during a marathon session of psychotherapy this pile molten rat dung came to light, and i now blame it for ALL my social behavioral problems. To complain about acting, plot, direction, screen writing, et cetera, would completely miss the point and the central tragedy surrounding this film. At some point in time somebody thought it was a decent and sell-able idea to cut a handsome check to dan akroyrd (god bless him for elwood) and rosie o'donnell to put on bondage gear and strut around nude with bad wisecracks for the better part of a ninety minute movie. I'm not terribly original in my reviews of movies (nor anything in this life) and i don't think i'm the first in IMDb to point it out but there is a level of true masochism in casting photogenically impaired stars to star in a motion picture about sado-masochism and bondage. The irony (intended or not) can't be lost on people. This is truly one of the most awful things committed to film since Pink Flamingoes, which could always fall back on the cynical train wreck view of film as a reason to watch. No, someone took this seriously and perpetrated it in cold blood.

PS Dana Delaney is kinda hot.......

2 out of ten only because there is no zero and i was too lazy to make it to one...."
Fluke (1995),"Fluke is a family movie whom someone couldn't give so much credit.

In my opinion it's great. I always loved pets and non-domestic animals so I can truly believe they've got a soul.

In the movie, a young child loses his father, but for magic his soul transmigrates in a dog. With some clues, Fluke the dog will be accepted as the reincarnation of the dear daddy.

I've lost my father at the age of 3. Sometimes is very hard think of it but I've got a special feeling with my cat. She's with me since 11 years (now I'm 26), I can see in her eyes a true spirit, like an angel standing by.

With the help of this movie I've raised the conviction that animals should be guiding souls of exhaled dears for us.

Yes, I still believe, though my ""old"" age, in such romantic things.

----- My vote: 8 1/2 -----"
Immortal Beloved (1994),"If was a director, I would be sure to look at such films as ""Kafka"", ""Quiz Show"", and ""Immortal Beloved""(and many many others) and hope that my film would have as much style and taste as these films, particularly ""Immortal Beloved."" From the first time I saw it, ""Immortal Beloved"" became one of my all-time favorite movies. For one thing, I love the cast. Director Bernard Rose has filled his movie with such top-notch European actors as Johanna Ter Steege, Valeria Golino, Marco Hofschnieder, Miriam Margoyles, Isabella Rossellini, and particularly in the choosing of his two leads--Jeroen Krabbe(my favorite actor) and Gary Oldman. I have seen and enjoyed all of these actors in one or more other project, and to have them ALL together is just wonderful. Plus the director genius, Bernard Rose, also wrote a great script:the flashback sequences give us a great look upon Beethoven, and they very carefully fit around the search that Beethoven's secretary embarks upon to find the mysterious woman, the ""Immortal Beloved"", whom Beethoven left his entire estate and music to in a letter. I like how he narrows he is able to narrow his search to just three women, after finding a nearly illegible signature the woman left behind at a hotel(""is that a G or a J?"" Schindler wonders. ""Looks like an A to me,"" he is told by the hotel worker). I like being able to learn the impact Beethoven left upon all three, and the accounts of Schindler and his nephew provide some great insite as well. I love the chemistry between all cast members, particularly Oldman and Krabbe and Krabbe and Rossellinni. Well, I loved absolutely everything about this movie. I can only hope that if I ever made a movie, it would turn out to be as well-written, superbly acted, and as beautifully made as ""Immortal Beloved."""
Junior (1994),"No doubt the makers of this film had one major supposition in mind when planning and making ""Junior."" That would be that anyone with any biological knowledge about the human body would suspend it and accept this film's premise. So then, a human male could ingest a fertilized human egg from a woman and an embryo would implant Itself and grow in his stomach -- apparently, the large intestine. Of course, it would be immune to the powerful stomach acids that reduce a piece of beef to a clump of waste in a matter of hours. Of course, it would permeate the wall of the stomach to form its life sac for exchange of nutrients with the host. And so on, and so on.

So, once the audience members essentially shut down their brains, they will be able to see the humor in this theme, and be responsive to the comedy that follows. So the thinking must have gone. And, what might the comedy be, but a male acting out nuances and reactions of a woman in pregnancy. Most viewers didn't find much humor in that - well, after the first one or two times. And the script otherwise didn't have enough comedy to overcome the unfunny weird premise.

The movie public of 1994 didn't buy it at all. The film lost several million. U. S. Ticket sales didn't even match half of the budget, and the world gross didn't even cover the film's budget -- $108 million vs $60 million. The studio gets about 50% of the ticket sales.

With a budget that size for those stars in 1994, one would guess that Emma Thompson was offered a wad to make this movie. Otherwise, it's hard to imagine how she could have agreed to be in such a turkey of a film. This is a far cry from ""Twins,"" which had some pretty good comedy with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito.

This film is also billed as sci-fi. It's much closer to that that any real comedy. But mostly, it's a real dud and waste of money."
Nell (1994),"Not believable. So many of these ""wild person"" movies have been done, from Tarzan to Crocodile Dundee, that we know what to expect of them...nothing believable, and nothing to learn from. Characters in other movies have been suckled by wolves, raised to swing from vines like apes, to fight crocodiles by the Australian Aborigines, raised by Indians and taught to dance with wolves, who knows what else? The only thing is, it could never happen. Raised by people in other societies, yes, but children raised without contact with any other people, it's impossible. Nell, if she had been living like the story has us believe, would have matted hair, filthy skin that was callused from head to toe, and she would be eating caterpillars and bark, not the groceries that were delivered to her door every week. And if the grocer knew where she was living, so would everybody else. Who pays the grocer? Why is she wearing shoes that fit? Why is her skin so soft and smooth? Why does her sister have to be an identical twin to make their own language...she could just as easily be a cousin. The thing that bothers me the most is that the average hillbilly in the mountains of North Carolina are much worse off than she is, and yet she is the one with new clean clothes and perfect teeth, while they are the ones with none. You want to make a movie about hillbillies in NC, then just go into the woods and film an average family in those hills, you don't need to drag Jodie Foster in with 25 makeup artists to hide blemishes. We have her in a cabin near a road that some local bikers have found. Are they the first people who ever stumbled on that cabin? The US government has surveyed every square inch of land in this country, and census takers know where every cabin or shack is. I have 28 acres in a part of the Adirondacks that are every bit as remote as the hills of NC, and when I tried sneaking a cabin in there, within a week I had the Town Officials up there wanting to see my permit. The movie is impossible."
Queen Margot  1994),"During the late 16th century, Catholics and Protestant Huguenots are fighting over political control of France, which is ruled by the neurotic, hypochondriac King Charles IX (Jean-Hugues Anglade) and his mother, Catherine de' Medici (Virna Lisi) , a scheming power player. Catherine decides to make an overture of goodwill by offering up her daughter Margot (Isabelle Adjani) : Marguerite de Valois dite La Reine Margot in marriage to Henri de Bourbon (Daniel Auteuil) , a prominent Huguenot and King of Navarre, although she also schemes to bring about the notorious St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre of 1572, when thousands of Protestants are slaughtered. The marriage goes forward but Margot, who does not love Henri, begins a passionate affair with the soldier La Môle (Vincent Lindon) , also a Protestant from a well-to-do family. Attempt to murder Protestant Coligny (Jean-Claude Brialy) and other killings by poisoning follow, as court intrigues multiply and Queen Catherine's villainous plotting to place her son the Duke of Anjou (Pascal Greggory) on the throne threatens the lives of La Môle, Margot and Henri of Navarre. Two riders ride to Paris carrying a message for their respective lords. One is a faithful servant of Henry of Navarre, the other of the Duke of Guise (Miguel Bosé) , among others .

It's a nice but overlong rendition from the immortal novel by Alexandre Dumas with pretty budget , attention to period detail , breathtaking scenarios and a cast of thousands . The picture contains rousing action , intrigue , romance , treachery , mayhem and battles . Entertaining epic movie with big budget production , glamorous gowns and luxurious sets . The film was an international co-production between by several companies based in France, Germany, and Italy, with the additional participation of StudioCanal and the American company Miramax and the support of Eurimages . Gorgeous and picturesque cinematography by Phillippe Rousselot , among the locations were the Mafra Palace in Portugal, the Saint-Quentin Basilica, Saint-Quentin, Aisne, and the Château de Maulnes, Cruzy-le-Châtel in France. The La Reine Margot soundtrack was composed by Sarajevo-born composer Goran Bregovic. Like most of Bregovic's work, the soundtrack's melodies are heavily influenced by the Balkan folk music tradition. The motion picture was well directed by Patrice Chéreau .

Being correctly based on historical events : The St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in 1572 was a targeted group of assassinations and a wave of Catholic mob violence directed against the Huguenots (French Calvinist Protestants) during the French Wars of Religion. Traditionally believed to have been instigated by Queen Catherine de' Medici, the mother of King Charles IX, the massacre started a few days after the marriage on 18 August of the king's sister Margaret to the Protestant King Henry III of Navarre. Many of the wealthiest and most prominent Huguenots had gathered in largely Catholic Paris to attend the wedding. The massacre began in the night of 23-24 August 1572, the eve of the feast of Bartholomew the Apostle, two days after the attempted assassination of Admiral Gaspard de Coligny, the military and political leader of the Huguenots. King Charles IX ordered the killing of a group of Huguenot leaders, including Coligny, and the slaughter spread throughout Paris. Lasting several weeks in all, the massacre expanded outward to the countryside and other urban centres. Modern estimates for the number of dead across France vary widely, from 5,000 to 30,000. The massacre marked a turning point in the French Wars of Religion. The Huguenot political movement was crippled by the loss of many of its prominent aristocratic leaders, and many rank-and-file members subsequently converted. Those who remained became increasingly radicalized. Though by no means unique, the blood-letting ""was the worst of the century's religious massacres"". Throughout Europe, it ""printed on Protestant minds the indelible conviction that Catholicism was a bloody and treacherous religion"""
"Corrina, Corrina (1994)","and I'm a guy!.......

I found this movie to be so touching about humanity and reaching out where one might otherwise perceive as strained and socially adhered roles. Ray Liotta can be a sensitive and strong man while finding that the barriers for middle aged white men need not be either macho or constrained to ideology.

Liotta allows one to open their heart to all the possiblilties it is to be both a modern man, as well as a compassionate man, searching for the answers. Goldberg is the ""much more than"" maid, housekeeper and nanny who softens one's heart - and especially the heart of Liotta to see himself as he is. We see that men and women can accept and expand upon their roles.

This theme has been done a few times before, but this version hits the guts and heart like no other. The sensitivity inherent in the scriptwriters MUST be commended for ""untying"" the lines of deception that society puts upon us all.

YES_ this may sound like a bit much for me to express about a Family Type movie, but maybe I feel this was becuase of just that. It is a perfect family movie that families across America can love, endear and embrace."
Dave (1993),"This a sweet, if disposable, film. Kevin Kline plays Dave, owner of a temp agency with a very close resemblance to the President (also played by Kline). It's the good twin / evil twin version of The American President.

Dave is hired to double for the President at a fund raiser, so the President can sneak out of the building. While bedding his mistress (possibly an intern--the movie was ahead of its time) the President suffers a stroke and is incapacitated. Rather than turn things over to the Vice, the Chief of Staff and Press Secretary connive to put Dave in office, in hopes of running the show themselves. The First Lady (Sigourney Weaver) has been essentially separated from the President for years so she proves no problem (she can't stand the sight of her husband).

But Dave gets tired of being a puppet and starts to act like the President. He invites a CPA friend of his (Charles Grodin) to help trim the budget, chats with his bodyguard, and charms everyone in Washington.

This is an American version of The Prince and the Pauper. It certainly raises the usual questions: why are our politicians such manipulative, conniving bastards? The answer, of course, is that our political system rewards such. In America politicians cannot afford too much integrity of honesty. But we can dream can't we?"
Go Fish (1994),"This may be the first time you hear me say this, but Go Fish was too artistic and dated for my enjoyment. I think that if I had seen this film when it was first released back in 1994 I would have been impressed. This was a very avant-garde film that tried very hard to discuss an issue that was very ""hush-hush"" back in the early 90s. Lesbians were very closeted back then and were not a major part of the culture norm as they are today (well, as much as we recognize them today). This makes for a very provocative film, but it also makes for a very dated film. This was my biggest issue with this film was that it nearly felt like a comedy instead of this symbolic struggle to pursue happiness like any heterosexual relationship. I realize that director Rose Troche was trying to show us that a lesbian relationship is no different than a male and female relationship and even lesbians talk like men talk about women, but somehow it just felt very dated and cliché for me. It didn't open more doors in my mind to the lifestyle of lesbians, but instead gave me this dated image of this butch lesbian that is rebelling against something instead of embracing the true lifestyle.

The black and white photography, while symbolically trying to show the black and white of the situation and relationship, just felt like an art film. This was an art film, so what am I griping about? I guess I just didn't want to see an art film with this topic. I wanted to see something along the lines of Kids or even a documentary, not something where the uneducated will laugh at and ridicule even harder. I wanted a film that was going to punch me in the face, not build upon dated/old clichés that instead poked my mind randomly and not very hard. It was unimpressive. It wasn't bold film-making, but instead just this random, average production about a lesbian love story. Was it to be educational? I think there were elements that could have been explored greater and into detail to cross that education/lifestyle acceptance line. The scene dealing with bisexuality is the first that comes to mind. This probably sounded great on paper, but when it was actually filmed out, it seemed high schoolish and bland. The inner voices were not struggling with the character, but instead causing confusion and chaos that will never be resolved. Another scene that could have played out just a bit better was the dinner scene where a group of lesbians have gathered for a party. There could have been more discussed between the lesbians like lifestyle, issues, and current problems (that would help with the dated feel) instead of just sex, sex, and more sex.

That was a huge downfall for me was the constant reminder that all these women wanted was to have sex. There were times when I was watching this film where I felt a bit of sweetness in my mouth because I thought there was some candy-coating happening. This does not need to happen in a film that is supposed to bring the lesbian lifestyle closer into the spotlight. I never felt that these women in this film were given the best light to show their stuff anyway. From the beginning of the first scene until the last (and all those snippets in-between) all they could talk about was sex. They wanted to have sex more often than I honestly think about in a day. It really made the rest of the non-existent themes seem blurry and unimportant. There was just a consistent lack of togetherness for this film that ultimately hurt it in the long run. This wasn't a film about women's rights, but instead a dire attempt to show the similarities between homosexual and heterosexual relationships. I agree that this happened, but just not very coherently. There seemed to be other elements strewn together in a very loose fashion that took away from the overall power of the film. Don't get me wrong, this could have been a very powerful film about a lifestyle that this world is still not accepting, but instead it went too far to the left (which isn't bad, except in this case) and chose to go the bleeding artist route instead of the informative, here are the facts route. The black and white photography, the lack of character development (who really was Ely's partner?), and the cheesy moments between scenes where women talked to me about the illusive ""honey pot"". It just wasn't coming together well for me and eventually fell apart all together.

Overall, I was not impressed. There are greater films out there that express the power of the relationship and do not create this unimpressive ""raw"" sensation by trying to shock the audiences. One of my favorites is the film Big Eden which accepts homosexuality like it is commonplace in society. If Go Fish would have been done in a similar style, I think I could have walked away from the film with a better taste in my mouth. Instead, I am stuck with an unimpressive story that did nothing except joke about why lesbian women like to play the game ""Go Fish"". Ha ha ha h.it just isn't working for me. I do not recommend this film in the least bit. There was one, singular scene that made me chuckle and for the likes of me I cannot remember why. It was an unmemorable feast of bad cinema. Skip it.

Grade: * out of *****"
Made in America (1993),"This is the signature line of used car salesman Hal Jackson (Ted Danson) who's known for his banal T.V. ads, and whose placid, carefree life is about to be shattered by a nice girl named Zora Matthews (Nia Long), who's strong, independent mother Sara (Whoopi Goldberg) conceived her through artificial insemination after the death of her husband.

The movie opens with Zora storming out of the class room, after a blood test confirms that the man Sara was married to couldn't possibly be her father.

And after a sobbing accusation in Sara's shop (""Mom, before dad died, you had an affair!"" To which Sara's employee replies: ""Thank goodness this happened on one of MY work days!""), the truth is revealed to the agitated Zora.

Though Sara wants the matter of Zora's father closed, her daughter's curiosity is awakened.

And in the company of her friend Tea Cake Walters (Will Smith), she begins a relentless pursuit to discover the identity of her mother's donor.

When she finds Hal Jackson's name in the sperm banks computer, she is overjoyed, but there's one little problem... Hal is white.

Moreover, he has absolutely no interest in having a relationship with Zora.

But he soon finds himself having no choice, as a furious Sara (who's devastated about her child's father being white), storms in to the used car lot to yell at him, and an unlikely attraction sparks between them.

Whoopi Goldberg, and Ted Danson are terrific. I have rarely seen better chemistry between two people.

Nia Long is perfect, and Will Smith is -as always- great, as is a surprising Jennifer Tilly, who does an outstanding job as Hal's girlfriend Stacy.

This is a movie which restores one's faith in the inherent goodness of people. And in humanity as a whole.

It's a real rarity. One I hope will be appreciated as time goes on.

Philadelphia (1993),"While I was tremendously impressed by PHILADELPHIA when I watched it recently on cable TV, there were some things that bothered me. I thought the courtroom scenes were extremely well done except when it came time for TOM HANKS to take the witness stand. His scenes on the stand, instead of being as dramatic as the other witnesses, merely showed that he was becoming too ill to really give any insight into his character and motivations. Nothing was really revealed about the man himself.

Having said that, the other obvious weaknesses were in the script which was a little too contrived at times. Furthermore, Denzel Washington's willingness to overlook his homophobic attitudes and become a buddy to Hanks was just a little too implausible. Then too, the final hospital scene with all of the family gathered around Hanks was not quite convincing.

But credit must be given to Jonathan Demme's tasteful direction and to the very fine performances given by the large cast. Jason Robards, Jr. is a standout as the executive seeking to have Hanks dismissed. The only actor shortchanged by the script seems to be ANTONIO BANDERAS who is given little to do and does not really seem a plausible partner for the Hanks character. In other words, they have no chemistry together.

As for TOM HANKS, he surely deserved all the awards he received as the lawyer determined to find someone who will fight for his cause. DENZEL WASHINGTON is equally effective in a difficult role, demonstrating once again that he is an actor to watch as he matures with each characterization.

Absorbing all the way through--thoughtful, provocative and guaranteed to stir your interest in its delicate handling of a difficult subject."
Shadowlands (1993),"Shadowlands is, more often than not, described as a love story, and, sure enough, it is. But it is also a story about a famous writer and respected scholar, an Englishman of advancing years, who has repressed any and all feelings ever since he lost his mother as a young child.

Socializing mainly with his colleagues, and living with his brother, the protagonist has built an intimidating castle, surrounded by fortified walls and a deep and wide moat, in order to protect himself. Not against any threats from the outside world, but from reality and, most of all, from his inner self.

Now, what would happen if someone approached the outer gates of his castle? What would happen if someone knocked on his door?

Anthony Hopkins is brilliantly cast as the emotionally handicapped author C. S. Lewis, and he does a really good job of portraying him. Debra Winger performs well in her role as the author's American fan, but this is clearly Anthony Hopkins' show.

I recommend that you watch Shadowlands, but don't do it on a night when you're tired. This is a toned-down and fairly slow film, and to enjoy it thoroughly, you need to be focused."
Sirens (1994),"A soft-core, high-minded daydream about the liberating sensuality of art. Sometimes the sirens in the film (Elle MacPherson, Kate Fischer and Portia de Rossi) tickle one another merrily, and sometimes they talk about whether sea slugs make a good aphrodisiac.

The story is based on a real artist, Norman Lindsay(Sam Neill)and there was a real Anglican priest (played by Hugh Grant) sent to convince him to withdraw his ""Crucified Venus"" from exhibition. The film is set on Campion's estate and features his work throughout.

It is a little wild, silly at times, and features explicit nudity and sexual situations. Perfect introduction to Hugh Grant's abilities.

Skintastic moment: Portia de Rossi and her pals pose for a painting, the subject of which seems to be hot chicks who show rack, rug and rear.

Bonus Skintastic Moment: Kate Fischer flashes her ass and a bit of full- frontal from a distance while wading, then continues to bare her breasts for a very long time."
Jane Eyre (1996),"Jane Eyre (Anna Paquin) is an orphan living with her dead uncle Mr. Reed's family. His wife and kids are cruel to her. Mrs. Reed sends her to the Lowood Institution under the harsh Mr. Brocklehurst. She befriends Helen Burns who dies from neglect and sickness. Years later, Jane Eyre (Charlotte Gainsbourg) leaves her dead friend and her mentor Miss Temple to be the governess to French orphan Adèle Varens at at Thornfield Hall. Mrs. Fairfax (Joan Plowright) is the housekeeper and Edward Rochester (William Hurt) is the master. Strange things are happening in the estate. Her aunt dies after confessing her sins to Jane. Blanche Ingram (Elle Macpherson) arrives to be courted by Rochester.

Paquin's Jane doesn't really match Gainsbourg's Jane. Paquin is playing a defiant rebel. She's Joan of Arc. Gainsbourg is a wallflower. I really like Paquin but she may not be doing the character right. At the very least, these are almost opposite characters. Nevertheless, the story is compelling and the romance is romantic. Franco Zeffirelli's directing is beautiful. The Charlotte Brontë novel is a romantic epic and this movie delivers that."
"Last Supper, The (1995)","I just read through 48 comments and I think nobody mentioned ""Arsenic and Old Lace,"" which is an obvious source for the idea of quizzing guests and, as a good deed, giving wine with arsenic to those who'd be better off dead.

Here the story is set against a familiar political divide, and as the murders (and cameos) follow one another, the criteria for getting killed become distressingly looser until the audience becomes impatient for the inevitable retribution.

All this exposition of criteria takes considerable time, and evidently character development needed to be sacrificed. I'm sure that in creating a large group of murderers who all share a house, the creators had something in mind (other than ""Friends"") and we get the impression of an attempt at characterization but it doesn't jell. The movie would have been better off with just one couple in on the plot; that's all Shakespeare needed for Macbeth."
Ransom (1996),"What would happen in the movie was no big surprise to me really, thanks to the bad advertising for this movie, in which the main plot twist was already revealed.

Still ""Ransom"" is a very good watchable movie. OK calling it average maybe is not completely fair by me maybe, cause ""Ransom"" is more than average at times.

It really is good that this movies shows both sides of the kidnap, both the little boy's (Brawley Nolte, yes, indeed the son of...) parents (Mel Gibson, Rene Russo) and the kidnappers (Gary Sinise, Lili Taylor, Liev Schreiber, Donnie Wahlberg, Evan Handler.). The fact that it also shows the kidnappers is what makes this movie even more tense actually.

I'm sorry but I just can't stand Rene Russo in this movie. Her character really irritated me at times. Best actor is Gary Sinise who was really 'hot' in the mid-90's, ever since his Oscar nomination for one of my personal favorite movie's, ""Forrest Gump"". It was also nice to see the at the time fairly unknown actor Donnie Wahlberg, who also did a good job.

The music by James Horner is good, still I'm curious about the original Howard Shore score.

Yes the movie has some good moments and is perfectly watchable but it most certainly is not Ron Howard's or Mel Gibson's best. It also is not a movie that I enjoy watching multiple times. Also the original from 1956 is still a better movie even if it doesn't have action or a spectacular ending. At least it was more tense and less predictable as this movie was at times.
