Movie,Review
Toy Story (1995),"With the ever increasing proximity of Toy Story 3, I decided it was about time for me to revisit the original and its first sequel to refresh my memory. Having been among the original target audience, it's a real trip back to childhood.

The longtime favourite toy of young Andy, Woody is disgruntled to be pushed aside in favour of a new space-ranger action figure in the form of Buzz Lightyear. Admired by child and fellow toys alike, Buzz threatens Woody's territory, prompting an effort to remove him which results in the two being left many miles from home, with little time to get back before the family's move.

Now regarded fondly as one of the best kids' movies of all time, Toy Story was the catalyst which allowed Pixar to rapidly ascend to the throne of animation where they dominantly remain to this day. Certainly it wowed me when I first saw it, almost fifteen years ago now. Indulging every child's fantasy that their toys come to life when they're not looking, we find ourselves instantly aligned with the host of strange characters. The quality of the animation, revolutionary for its time, is seen instantly, proudly boasted in the movements of the soldiers as they march downstairs. Everything looks completely realistic and, most importantly, believable. Whilst amusing beforehand, the laughs only really start to build up when Buzz arrives and we are treated to his interactions with Woody, the disagreements between the two and their petty arguments forming the basis of the film's funny factor. The added maturity of years affords the understanding of some of the film's more adult jokes, adding a little something extra to the experience for returning viewers. The action-adventure side of the plot keeps up the drama, tension, and sense of doom, keeping us wondering whether or not the reluctant duo will ever make it back in time. The scenes in Sid's house are the film's best, in terms of keeping up suspense. Their oddness is stand-out and ever memorable, the stranger toys therein encountered doubtlessly having haunted many little 'uns over the years. Certainly still enjoyable, Toy Story remains an inherently good film, though for me it stands less high than the likes of Wall-E, lacking the considerable emotional impact of that later Pixar effort.

Carrying a vast legacy, Toy Story stands the test of time well, still as enjoyable as ever it was. Having paved the way for films which, as you would hope, took what it did and did them better, it is enduring, endearing, and thoroughly entertaining."
GoldenEye (1995),"This movie fully deserves it's status as a classic in the action/thriller/spy/drama category. It's so much fun, well written, solid dialogue and yet it finds that sweet spot with just the right amount of classic Bond ridiculousness. Famke Jensenn playing Onatopp, a soviet assassin who kills men by riding them to death in bed? Yup, sounds like a Bond movie. Judi Dench absolutely kills it as M, I love the gravitas and complexity she brings to the role. Even back in 1995 calling out Bond, what some would consider to be the fictional epitome of toxic masculinity and chauvinism, and saying he's a dinosaur and that she has no problem sending him off to die if she has to. Love her so much in this. As for Bond himself, this may be because I grew up in this period but I have always loved Brosnan in the role. Yes, the later films get exponentially more absurd and the quality absolutely goes down but he is so perfectly cast as the suave, charming and devilish-at-times international man of mystery. That man wears the hell out of those suits, drinks a martini with the best of them and looks just right in that Aston Martin.

Definite recommend for people interested in a solid action flick. The plot is a little crazy, but that was perfectly in line with when it was made and the style of film it's going for. Easily worth a rent."
Four Rooms (1995),"When I was in high school, anything Tarantino-related was required to be memorized. Yes, even this one was insisted upon in high school, though perhaps not as strongly as QT's first two. This portmanteau follows bellhop Tim Roth as he gets into several adventures over New Year's Eve. I remember liking this one quite a bit, but, viewing it now, it's just too uneven to be worthwhile. Anders' first segment is easily the low point, thankfully. Any film starring Madonna should be immediately suspect, and everything about this tale of witches is awful. Rockwell's segment is a bit of an improvement, but too forgettable. Rodriguez's segment is the one I remember being the best, and it thankfully does hold up okay. Antonio Banderas is hilarious in it, and most of the jokes hit. I remember QT's segment being the worst originally, but I actually thought it was by far the best this time around. It usually gets flack, I think, because it stars Tarantino, but he's comfortable here playing a pompous movie director. It's honestly his best performance (if it had been readily available, I might have suffered through Destiny Turns on the Radio again) and his direction is pretty brilliant. The one thing that really drags this whole movie down is Tim Roth. Man, I remember loving him when I was a teenager, and, though I criticized his performance in Reservoir Dogs above, he's on Olivier's level there compared to his awful mugging here. Even if QT's segment were the weakest, it would automatically be upgraded to the strongest just because he's the only one who settles Roth the crap down, a bit at least."
Get Shorty (1995),"The mobster flick mixes with show business in ""Get Shorty,"" the mob comedy from ""The Addams Family"" director Barry Sonnenfeld. The two (mob movies and Hollywood) have always gotten along well together from ""The Godfather"" to ""Goodfellas,"" so ""Get Shorty"" taking the humorous business angle is only a natural evolution. Starring John Travolta hot off of ""Pulp Fiction,"" it's an enjoyable film for those who love movies and those who love the mob.

""Get Shorty"" is mostly about the former. Chili Palmer (Travolta) is a loan shark/shylock who flies out to Hollywood to collect a debt and partly to avoid his new boss, Ray Bones, the perfect jerk with a foul mouth played by Dennis Farina. In LA, Palmer meets producer Harry Zimm (Gene Hackman) and becomes fond of the movie business, offering to help Zimm get some lenders who've invested in one of his films off his back.

There's some strong irony between the movie business and mob movies, e.g. Chili pitches the story of why he's out in LA as a movie idea to Zimm who thinks he's got something, but its the rock solid performances of Travolta, Hackman, Farina and Delroy Lindo that sell you on ""Get Shorty.""

Film-lovers will appreciate many references from ""Touch of Evil"" to ""Three Men and a Baby"" as the movie takes plenty of shots at the industry. Those more into the mob angle will enjoy how everyone's out to get everyone -- some for legitimate reasons, others because they want in on the movie business. It displaces the gangster movie from its cozy home in New York, Boston or Miami and drops it into the glitz of Hollywood where it fits well seeing as the industry is not exactly the cleanest.

""Get Shorty"" is not overly impressive, maintaining interest through its performances and our wondering just when one of these guys is going to up the stakes and off someone -- such are the thrills of a mob movie. Its lack of a definitive objective and therefore constant evolution into a story about something other than what it started as definitely holds it back, but not beyond of the point getting to enjoy it. ~Steven C

Copycat (1995),"An interesting idea here is that we have two professional women dealing with the issue of violence against women. Sigourney Weaver plays Helen Hudson, author and expert on serial killers who becomes agoraphobic after an encounter with a killer. Holly Hunter plays M.J. Monahan, slightly nasal lead detective who smiles a lot and looks just out of high school but who can be as steely and relentless as any male cop.

Most of the plot binds Helen and M.J. in their pursuit of an intelligent serial killer who terrorizes San Francisco. It's the chemistry between the two women that make ""Copycat"" somewhat unique among the list of psychological thrillers. There's plenty of suspense, with gloved hands, shadowy figures, and silence. Long camera takes enhance creepy tension as does odd camera angles.

As with most thrillers of this kind, the killer seems to know exactly where to be and when to be there, and that's a genre problem. There are also some story clich√©s, like dependence on television news and the use of computers to convey information to the audience. I did not like the bathroom segments, and Harry Connick Jr. needs to confine his efforts to his great music. The film's climax descends into unrealistic silliness.

Production design is fine. Of note is Helen's elaborate and modern apartment, wherein almost one-third of the film takes place. The score varies appropriately from melancholy to eerie to classical. But I dislike the song ""Murder By Numbers"", mercifully played just once. Casting is credible; acting is above average. Weaver gives a convincing performance, and Holly Hunter is good in every movie I have seen her.

A lot of research went into this film on serial killers. For example, we know that most organized serial killers hide behind a mask of normalcy; and in a couple of early scenes our killer shows up as just another average Joe, undetectable in his apparent sanity.

The story here is a bit contrived. But it draws viewers in with lots of tension and suspense. And with the performances of Weaver and Hunter, the film's imperfections seem less severe."
Shanghai Triad  1995),"One the most beautiful films I saw in the last fifteen years, together with ""Burnt by the Sun"" from Mikhalkof, ""the Piano"" from Campion and ""Heavenly creatures"" by Jackson.

It's filmed in a very artistic and original way, quite a perfect fusion between independent/innovative and classical/stylish styles. Like if Polansky, Cronenberg, Bertolucci, Spielberg and Annaud were made one! Kubrick's influence is noticeable too, in the very ""quiet"" way of filming that give this ""surrealistic"" feeling to trivial events. It's incredible to feel so close, so empathetic to characters so different from us...

I was very moved AND fascinated at the time.

I'd recommend it to anyone who likes unique movies, and it can be watched with pleasure by anyone who not the ""technolywood"" kind (Cameron & Emmerich fans, stay away from this one, you'd be bored to death!) I'd like to see more from this director..."
Twelve Monkeys (1995),"It is unfortunate that all big budget films cannot be as good as 12 MONKEYS. But alas is that not what makes these once in a while films so special? Obviously director Gilliam is a rare talent, a treasure. But even for him 12 Monkeys outshines nearly everything else he's ever done. (And that says a lot. Brazil after all is another incredible film.) But this movie has two things going for it that ale it rise to the very top of the top. #1 it features a stellar cast who all equally deliver fantastic performances. This is Bruce Willis at his peak -- before he sold out and went all Die Hard, when e still cared about being taken seriously as an actor. Same with Brad Pitt. Many attribute this film as the first time Pitt showed the world that he truly was an actor and not just another pretty face. (He further proved that point in Fight Club and many others through the years -- Money Ball, Tree of Life, et al.) and then there's Madeline Stowe. Besides the stellar acting though 12 Monkeys accomplished something even more important: it gave us the opportunity for future films such as Memento and Inception. 12 Monkeys not only featured a non-linear approach to time travel, it did so erratically boldly dynamically and unapologetically so, allowing future filmmakers, like the aforementioned referenced Nolan brothers, to feel safe stepping even further out on those limbs. 12 Monkeys opened that door and so many others. This is a film you can see over and over and still see something new in it AND be moved by. A classic by all standards."
Babe (1995),"""Babe"" is a charming, subtle sleeper that's filled with suspense, humor, and genuinely touching drama...in other words, it has all the elements mainstream movies seldom deliver. The fact that the movie's central characters are barnyard animals makes it even more of a fascinating achievement. Examples:

An early scene in which Babe, the orphaned piglet on Hoggett's farm, cries ""I want my mom"" is more emotionally effective than all of the sappy melodrama squeezed into three hours of ""Titanic.""

The scene in which Farmer Hoggett (James Cromwell), despondent over a sick Babe, does an Irish jig to cheer the porker up, is funnier than anything I saw in ""There's Something About Mary.""

And finally, the climactic sequence, in which Babe participates in a sheep-herding competition (reserved for dogs), is more suspenseful and exciting than anything you'll find within ""The Matrix.""

And everything in between these moments is sensational, as well.

Dead Man Walking (1995),"The story of a nun who is assigned to be the spiritual advisor of a man who has only a short time to live before his execution. He has already been on death row for six years. He and another man have been convicted of the brutal murder of a couple out parking in the woods.

The dialogue is fantastic as Sister Helen has meaningful discussions with not only our 'dead man' Matthew Poncelet, but also his family and the families of the victims involved. The film builds in intensity until unleashing a stunning and gripping conclusion that left me deeply moved. It's also an educational piece on the lethal injection process, something most people would have no clue about before viewing this film. Both Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn exhibit phenomenal acting from beginning to end. You can see real emotion in their faces and movements especially towards the end. There's not one moment in the film that feels unnecessary, not one moment in the film that seems contrived. Everything feels real and the direction (from Tim Robbins, who played the main character in The Shawshank Redemption only a year earlier) attests to its greatness.

It's a bit of casting cleverness that Scott Wilson - who played one of the two killers in 1967's ""In Cold Blood"" - is playing a chaplain here.

A couple of points - Matt starts out manipulative with Prejean even trying some pedestrian jail house come on initially, but she lets him know where things stand right off the bat. I wonder if he would have ever taken responsibility for what he did and admitted his crimes to Sister Prejean if he was not about to be executed. Bravado seems to be a big part of his identity. He ultimately admits he would not have been in the woods doing what he did to get to death row if he had the courage to stand up to his crazy companion and just walk away.

And this is the thing about these kinds of cases, the individual is on trial, but often it is two people together each of whom can't back down in the presence of the other who do the most gruesome crimes. It really is the bad company they choose and poor impulse control when free to make those choices that leads to their downfall. Some call it the synergy of evil."
Richard III (1995),"Ian McKellen has been one of the most versatile actors for many years. One of his most pronounced roles was in this adaptation of William Shakespeare's ""Richard III"". Taking place in a fictional version of 1930s England, it depicts Richard as a fascist wannabe dictator. His flags and rallies look like something right out of Nazi Germany.

I should admit that I've never read Shakespeare's original play or seen a production thereof - I don't even know that much about the War of the Roses - so this is my introduction to it. The movie has made me eager to see it. Fine support comes from the rest of the cast as assorted relatives, consorts and aides. The movie could be seen as a warning about autocratic leaders, especially as we currently see ascendant authoritarianism around the world. I recommend it.

PS: McKellen later played a Nazi in Bryan Singer's ""Apt Pupil"", while John Wood is best known as Prof. Falken in ""WarGames""."
Seven  1995),"A retiring Detective and a young rookie are hunting down a serial killer, a killer with a dark MO, murdering his victims using the seven deadly sins.

As I watch this, it's coming up to its thirtieth anniversary, and it's as fresh now as it was back in 1995, it's an intensely macabre take, crimes that are infinitely macabre and depraved, and intensely twisted.

The combination of Freeman and Pitt is incredible, they work immensely well together, we have the fresh zest of Mills, and the unshakable, but battle weary Somerset. Paltrow and Spacey are excellent in support.

Two hours flashed past, there is no lull, no moment to switch off and boil the kettle, the intensity is immediate, the pacing designed to keep you glued.

I have always thought there is a shade of Alfred Hitchcock about this movie, such is the intelligence of the plot.

Very good visuals, the macabre and gruesome bodies look shocking still, nothing is spared or hidden away.

10/10."
"Usual Suspects, The (1995)","The Usual Suspects is two movies in one. Enjoyable the first time you watch it, even more enjoyable the second time round. The first viewing asks questions that are answered in an `I could kick myself' moment in the final few minutes, and the second viewing is interesting because when you know the answers, the film becomes that much clearer. It requires a certain amount of commitment, though. Be warned, if you stop concentrating for a moment then the remaining running time of the movie will be spent trying to figure out how what you missed has lead to what you are now watching.

It concerns the story of five felons brought in by the police for a line-up and how those same felons reluctantly end up working for the mysterious and ghost-like Keyser Soze: a legend among the criminal fraternity, a man who no-one has seen and lived, a man so dangerous that he is thought to be the devil himself.you get the idea. The plot is rather intricate so I shan't bother to explain it here but it does rather make me think that Christopher McQuarrie, the writer, kept going to the office in the morning with yet another complexity to add that he thought up the night before. That's not to say it doesn't work, far from it, but it does leave you reeling from the sheer amount of information and names thrown at you from the offset.

Gabriel Byrne is good, but not flawless, as the tortured Dean Keaton who is torn between his career as a criminal and his forlorn attempt at trying to go straight, but his relationship with uptown lawyer Edie Finneran (Suzy Amis) is badly explored and I never felt it gave motive enough for his actions throughout the movie. Kevin Spacey is wonderful as the crippled Roger 'Verbal' Kint and is effective with the results both cunning and tragic. The real star of the movie, however, is a strangely accented Pete Postlethwaite as Kobayashi, supposedly Keyser Soze's right-hand man. He effortlessly plays a character of terrible coolness and poker-faced efficiency leading the dance that the rest of the characters must follow.

Director Bryan Singer has done well to bring such a momentous and involved screenplay to life and any gripes I may have cannot detract from the fact that the film, as a whole, is much better than the sum of its parts."
Mighty Aphrodite (1995),"Sportswriter Lenny Weinrib (Allen) and his wife (Bonham-Carter) adopt a baby from an anonymous mother. After a few years pass, Lenny starts to wonder about the woman. Curiosity quickly gets the better of him, so he steals files from the adoption agency and sets out to find her. Lenny is dismayed, maybe even terrified, to find that Linda (Sorvino,) the mother, is a beautiful $200-an-hour prostitute. So that he can fashion the proper mother-son reunion and save himself from what fate seems to have in store, he determines to 'reform' Linda. Interwoven throughout the story is a Greek chorus (including F. Murray Abraham and Olympia Dukakis,) who add their own unique take on the proceedings.

I've always preferred Woody Allen's comedies over his dramas. This one is probably one of my favorites. This film is a great example of Woody Allen showing no interest in convincing his audience into swallowing down some serious morals. It's light, fluffy, shamelessly sentimental and does not suffer a bit because of it. The plot is generally an uplifting tale of changing ones life for the better, and intertwined with this is some of Woody Allen's best humor. There are many entertaining characters, especially Mira Sorvino's prostitute and Michael Rapaport's dim-witted boxer, Kevin.

The stand-out here is Mira Sorvino. She is absolutely enthralling, with her ditsy nature and confidence masking a timid vulnerability, all of which earned her a well deserved Oscar. Linda could have been an over the top, cartoonish character, Pygmalion on crack. But under the careful direction of Allen, Sorvino gives the best performance of her career so far, and one of the funniest performances ever."
"Postino, Il (1994)","For all intents and purposes, this is Massimo Troisi's film and it is tragic and yet, and yes, poetic, that he died a few hours after giving this memorable, multi-layered performance. The waves are welcomed on the shore of tranquil and beautiful Capri as the final scene unwinds. Then a poem simply written on the black screen closes the tale by summarizing and succinctly depicting the essence of the movie, before a dedication is made: ""To our friend Massimo"" This is Troisi's film and he also participated in the fine writing with a simple but heartfelt story and exquisite dialogue. Although Troisi is also a director, this time, it is English director Michael Radford who will put all the pieces together of this timeless story and also contribute to the writing. In a way, this is the beginning of how this project becomes international and goes beyond Italy, both outside and inside the picture (althought all the action actually takes place in Capri, Italy). Argentinian Luis Enr√≠quez Bacalov will win an Oscar for his peaceful, poignant score. I suppose that French Philippe Noiret, from Cinema Paradiso ) fame will need as little directing as Troisi in portraying real life Chilean poet and political activist Pablo Neruda. In the movie you will also hear Spanish and hear about Chile (and Sweeden, Russia, France) as if they are actual characters of the movie.

The screenplay is based on, Chilean writer, Antonio Sk√°rmeta's El cartero novel about Nobel Prize winner Pablo Neruda and a bond he forms with a postman in Isla Negra in Chile. Skarmeta had already adapted his own work for the screen (and directed it); the Spanish-language Ardiente paciencia(1983), which I would love to see eventually. Il Postino transposes the story to Italy where Neruda was given a place to stay in a villa in Capri by Edwin Cerio during his real life exile in 1952.

The tale is simple enough. A young man who does not want to become a fishermen like most men of his hometown decides to be the private postman (for pennies) of popular poet that lives in exile in a near-by villa. Intrigued by this famous figure, he starts to awkwardly ask questions about poetry and a genuine friendship develops between them.

Mario, the postman, is lovestruck by Beautiful Beatrice (Scicilian Maria Grazia Cucinotta) and runs to the man who seemingly woes hundreds of women with words, but her ultra-catholic aunt may end up being a bigger obstacle than his lack of romantic banter. Beyond the typical love story that is more of a backdrop to the tale of friendship is the appreciation for poetry and in art to express the beauty of life. In fact, in a way it is also Pablo Neruda's film. The real life poet who's poetry is used in the movie and who's life inspired the character that is so central to the story, to the small town to Mario's growth as an individual. He who can barely read and write, and says that he wants to be a poet just like his friend and idol. Very inspirational. A true work of art in every aspect. I cannot sincerely think of a bad thing to say about this one."
Mr. Holland's Opus (1995),"It's a MOVIE! I'm reading comments so vastly polarized to one extreme or another so as not to be believed.

Okay, I am a musician. I've been one on a professional level for over ten years, both as a writer and performer. And I LOVED this movie (apologies to all those pretentious 'serious' musicians out there). I enjoyed my theatrical viewing and I have watched my DVD several times.

Is MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS musically accurate? No, of course not, no more so than STAR TREK paying attention to factual science and the laws of physics. But for the most part, nobody other than most of us ego-driven, high horse bound musician types will ever know it.

Designed to have a broad appeal outside the aforementioned musically inclined crowd? Yes, but then so is nearly every movie to come out of Hollywood. It has to be palatable to a certain degree, and I believe that the much maligned ""Play the sunset"" scene is far more entertaining than having Mr. Holland give us lengthy exposition on the proper articulation and technique that goes into playing a given instrument.

And if I hear one more poster scream about Mr. Holland's 'opus' only being ten minutes long (the ""It took him a lifetime to write THIS?"" mantra) I think I'll scream. Did it ever occur to anybody that what we heard was only a small part of a much larger work? Most classical and semi-classical pieces occur in (get ready) MOVEMENTS! It's entirely possible that we only heard the prologue to a much larger piece. Think outside the box, people.

As for the quality of the piece itself, I found it to be acceptable, if not the most dynamic piece of work I've ever heard. But seeing as how we had been hearing snippets of this piece THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE, I can't say that I was so overwhelmingly let down as some of our more 'educated and refined' musician types that have posted here.

Sure, there were some flaws. Ms. Headly is not the greatest actress in the world, and beside Dreyfuss she's downright embarrassing. William Macy's character is so cliched that it warrants no further discussion. The whole subplot with Rowena and her romantic interest in Mr. Holland ran about ten minutes too long. And the ending bit where the arts funding gets cut seemed a little too political.

But overall, a great film, surely one of Dreyfuss' best, and one of my favorite films.

I'm a musician. And I liked it. So sue me...."
French Twist  1995),"Mainstream comedies that deal with Homosexuality and bisexuality normally do so in one or two ways; they make fun of the alternate lifestyles or they use two women who are both very beautiful and seemingly straight and merely have them make out to excite the male portion of the audience that the movie is generally geared towards. (I.e.: the kiss in Cruel Intentions that got enormous publicity for the movie). Basically it is used as a way for a B-movie to get some extra attention from the news media and therefore get more film goers. This French film, however has a different approach, it treats the kissing scenes as just some normal scene. There are two people kissing, not two women kissing. It also has the ability to draw you in with more of a story than a Hollywood movie of the same fashion would. This is primarily because the Hollywood movie would be shot in a more exploitive way than this film.

The plot is fairly predictable, however there are several twists that make this movie much more interesting then I would have originally thought. The idea behind this story is not very original, and neither are the characters portrayed, however the story and the few plot twists that occur make it intriguing enough to keep you in your seat. The aesthetic quality of the film is about average for a film of this age (it was made in the mid 1990's), and budget.

Although this is not a film that I would readily watch again, and wouldn't have normally picked up in the first place it may be worth a look if it is in the normal genre of films that you like."
From Dusk Till Dawn (1996),"When I watched FDTD, I didn't have any major expectations, and so I wasn't disappointed with the result. It took me a bit to get a hold of the sudden plot shift. For the most part there wasn't really anything that stuck with me, except for George Clooney's tattoo and the final shot of the movie. OTOH, this is a movie that I would certainly watch again. Partly because I like Juliette Lewis (maybe that will give you a reference point on which to compare my opinion), but also because it's a good ride while it lasts.

Don't go looking for deep meaning where there isn't one, you'll only come out feeling cheated.

Oh, and BTW, this movie really isn't for the weak of stomach.

I give it 65%."
Antonia's Line (1995),"""Antonia's Line"" is one of those movies that's in love with its own quirkiness. This isn't always necessarily bad. Quirky films can be quite delightful when done well. However, in this case, the quirkiness comes at the expense of plot and logic. My sense is that this film's director intended Antonia and her line of female descendants to represent strong, fearless heroines imbued with the fighting feminist spirit. I get this sense because most of the men in this film are brutes, buffoons or a combination of the two, and the women kick butt, make love to each other and tell all of the men off at regular intervals.

This film is insulting to anyone who truly values feminist sensibilities in our movie culture. As so often happens, the makers of this movie equate ""strong"" with callous and emotionally distant. It's hard to care about Antonia and her relations because they all come across as either vacuous or heinous. Antonia's daughter casually chooses a complete stranger to impregnate her because she wants a child but doesn't want to have to deal with the father. Did she ever think that maybe the child would want a father. Is selfishness like this supposed to impress me with its strength of character?

The script meanders from one incident to the next, characters you barely learn anything about appear and drop out of the movie listlessly, and the pacing of the whole thing is limpid. The film is only about 110 minutes long but feels much longer.

I'm tired of the trend of thinking that propagates the belief that in order to be considered strong, women must prove that they can live entirely without men. That's such a juvenile attitude and serves no purpose. Callousness is callousness whether displayed by a man or a woman, and there's nothing weak about leaving yourself vulnerable to the complex relationships that spring between men and women. Of all the life lessons Antonia supposedly passes down to her ancestors, this is the one she forgot to include.

Grade: D+"
Angels and Insects (1995),"This was thoroughly engaging and thoughtful film, with a rich and fascinating plot and characters.

The opening scene of the natives of South America dancing is a well edited opening, and the word 'Angels"" appears over it. Indeed, all the Angels in this film are not in England (where the rest of the film takes place). William Adamson (Mark Rylance), a biologist who collects rare insects (especially the butterfly), survives a shipwreck and comes under the protection of an upper class English family. That's where he falls in love with Eugenia (Patsy Kensit). But every family has it's secrets.

Someone described this as ""Merchant-Ivory meets Tennessee Williams"", which is a perfect way to describe this film.

Several have complained about the actors, saying that there is not a single stand-out performance. I disagree, as both Rylance and Kristin Scott Thomas (in a performance worthy of an oscar nomination) acquit themselves well. The script is also very well written, and the costumes deserved the Oscar nomination.

One of the ten best of 1996."
Muppet Treasure Island (1996),"This is simply my favorite Muppet movie. The adaption of this classic story written Robert Louis Stevenson into a Muppet world is, in my opinion, one of the best adaption ever made in the history of Muppet movies.

The movie is quite family friendly, but I can say, as an adult, that I enjoyed it immensely. The humor is never dull, and the numerous musical numbers in this movie makes it a pearl in the world of the Muppets.

I'd just like to point out Tim Curry's role in this movie. Casting him as Long John Silver just adds to the already sky-high quality. With Tim Curry you get both good acting AND good singing.

If you like pirate themed movies, and are not afraid to please your inner child, this movie is most definitely for you!"
Rumble in the Bronx (1995),"""Rumble in the Bronx"" is the film that finally popularized Jackie Chan for American audiences. Released in the US over a year later than it's initial Hong Kong release, Rumble is a film that Jackie made on his own terms, as compared to his earlier failed attempts at breaking into the US market (i.e. ""Battle Creek Brawl"", ""The Cannonball Run"" ""The Protector""). Those film were all made by American directors and Chan's input and control was limited (""Battle Creek Brawl"" is probably the best of the lot). With Rumble, Jackie shot the film with his Hong Kong crew and had his usual level of control, and it's his mix of a US setting (though actually shot in Vancouver, B.C. as seen by the very unNYC-like mountains in the background) and being able to deliver his amazing fight sequences and jaw-dropping stuntwork along with his endearing comedy that was finally allowed to make it's way to US theaters and won over American audiences, leading to major roles in Hollywood films where he was given more creative control, such as ""Rush Hour"" ""Shanghai Noon"" and ""The Karate Kid"" remake. Rumble sees Jackie playing the nephew of Bronx grocery store owner, Chan stock company actor Bill Tung, who is selling the business to Anita Mui (a real-life pop singer turned actress known as the ""Madonna of Hong Kong""), who's store is plagued by a local street gang. Jackie finds himself at odds with the gang after trying to protect the store as well as protecting the wheelchair bound younger brother of a pretty female gang member, who quickly becomes Jackie's love interest. It's basically ""Death Wish 3"" but with Jackie Chan.Generally speaking, it's a dumb story that's a recycle of I don't know how many 80s Charles Bronson vigilante films and even by those standards the villains are incredibly silly and a ridiculous approximations of what real street gangs are like, but that's not why you watch a Jackie Chan picture. You watch a Jackie Chan movie for the exciting, creative, and acrobatic fight sequences (the best is a knockout sequence in the gang hideout) and for Chan's insane death defying stunts (here he jumps between buildings without a harness and also gets run over by a hovercraft, though it was his leap off a bridge onto the hovercraft that broke his foot, causing him to perform a significant amount of the film in a cast!). Overall, despite some minor tampering by the US distributor, deleting some of the comedy, completely re-dubbing the film, and adding a new soundtrack, ""Rumble in the Bronx"" is one of Chan's better films and is very nearly one of his best (though his best films are ""Drunken Master II"" ""Project A"" ""Dragons Forever"" and ""Police Story"")."
"Birdcage, The (1996)","Not many gay-themed movies get mainstream releases (because they're generally boring and predictable) but thanks to a stellar cast and a truly funny script, 'The Birdcage' certainly got what it deserved.

I generally don't enjoy gay-themed movies for their predictability - or comedies for that matter - but I absolutely loved 'The Birdcage'. Robin Williams stars as cabaret club owner Armand, who - together with his life partner Albert (excellently portrayed by Nathan Lane) - live a flamboyant lifestyle. When Armand's son, Val (Dan Futterman) is about to get married to a conservative senator's daughter, though, their lives are about to change - with hilarious consequences!

'The Birdcage' is laugh-out-loud funny - thanks also to the brilliant cast. Nathan Lane and Hank Azaria (as their houseboy Agador) are hysterical!! And Robin Williams is a feast for the eyes with that hairy chest, which he loves flaunting to absolutely no complaints from my side!

I loved the characters, the premise, the script, the fantastic performances, and the set design. This is undoubtedly one of my favourite gay-themed movies, as well as one of my favourite comedies. It's absolutely fabulous, darling!!"
"Brothers McMullen, The (1995)","I don't really ask that much from a movie..just keep my interest, give me a reason to keep watching. I kept watching this but I don't know why. I was waiting for something to happen, something to show me that the TV Guide calling this 'charming' is justified.

Edward Burns must have family that work for TV Guide.

This movie is all the same thing...all just talk, talk, talk, and almost all of it is strikingly the SAME tone. Its like looking at one color for 90 minutes. Every single conversation starts out the same way and the same issues are discussed over and over and over. I was wishing for a drunk friend, a stoner down the street, SOMETHING to give this some life, because you only see the same seven people in the movie. No one seems to have any friends or do anything but examine their feelings. And no new ground in living in the world is ever covered..you've heard it all before, and by better actors, too.

This is topped by a faux-Hollywood ending, the main couple kissing in the middle of the street as cabs go by..hey, anything to get the damn thing over with, but it reeks of desparation.

4/10."
Bad Boys (1995),"The first instalment of the Bad Boys franchise served its purpose well, meaning it did what it was suppose to do. The score establish Michael Bay as more than a music video director, it proved black leads could spew on the fence jokes about society and still deliver at the box office and most importantly, in my opinion, catapult Will Smith into the realm of being a superstar.

In all senses of the word the movie is a Hollywood classic, with grown folks alone present it would be the perfect movie to play at a family gathering. It has action, a love interest and laughs to go around at every turn. The chemistry between Martin and Will makes this movie stand out among Hollywood's well established duo action films. Always compared to that of Rush Hour.

In terms of acting there were no horrendous performances, however, Will's portrayal of his character was not completely believable. At times it seemed a bit forced, as if attempting to be this hard stone playboy, then again it was his introduction to the big stage and with that perspective in mind, he did really well in regards to his prior experience.

The only issue with this film for me was the film editing it did not feel cohesive enough, certain shots felt out of place and therefore made the quality of the film seem cheap. It is my belief this and a few other political ambitions and perspectives at that time in the 90's prevented it from being critically acclaimed.

The crazy thing is that for me, aside from the comedy, the music and sound mixing was my favourite part of the movie. Partially biased to my Jamaican culture perhaps but the sound track and the sound editing on this film was phenomenal, then again Bay had done plenty music videos before he tried his hand in film so there is that.

I also forgot to mention Martin did really well in his roll, his character protryal was believable in the sense that he really embodied that role.

With all of this in mind I believe this film warrants a 6/10. Thank you for your time and I hope Bay's films continue to garner success."
Apollo 13 (1995),"I am amazed this film does not have a higher mark than 7.5 at the moment. It is difficult to see how this could have been done any better - a genuinely thrilling story that encompasses the very best in humanity.

The casting is perfect - everyone puts their heart into it (Ed Harris is especially worth a mention), and the special effects are not only an incredible achievement in themselves, but also used just the way they should be - to tell the story, not replace it. The Zero-G is brilliantly executed, and the CGI Saturn5 on the launch pad is utterly convincing.

Regardless of the fact that we all know the outcome to the story before we start viewing, this is compelling edge of the seat stuff. Howard manages to convey the desperation of the situation, while never once leaving us without hope.

This film is just sheer class from beginning to end. You will love it even if you think you aren't interested in space exploration."
Belle de jour (1967),"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)

This psychodrama seems a little dated viewed today, and would be an ordinary film except for the fact that it stars the legendary French beauty Catherine Deneuve and is directed by the incomparable Spaniard Luis Bu√±uel, although this is not his best work. The quasi-Freudian exploration of the character of a woman who can only be sexually aroused and satisfied by being treated as trash doesn't exactly play in today's world, nor would it appear on Ms. Magazine's most admired list.

Deneuve demands the screen and is fascinating to watch, and Bu√±uel's direction, while not flashy or completely intelligible, is intriguing and focused. Bu√±uel has done some great work including two I recall, ""The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie"" (1972) and ""That Obscure Object of Desire"" (1977). His early work goes back to the silent film era. My favorite Deneuve film is ""Mississippi Mermaid"" (1969) followed closely by ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg"" (1964).

Deneuve is your high class, slightly cool beauty, somewhat in the manner of Grace Kelly. She looks like butter wouldn't melt in her mouth and so directors have always tried to sully her up. Bu√±uel smears her both literally and figuratively here as a day-tripping prostitute addicted to debasement. I don't buy the psychology, but this sort of thing used to play well. I recall an Italian movie from the same period in which the hero couldn't perform with his sweet and beautiful wife, but had to go slumming to get it on. I think it was called ""Bell Antonio"" or something like that."
Crimson Tide (1995),"If you like movies like ""Gladiator"" (2000) then you'll love this: all meat, no nutrients.

Here's my breakdown:

STORY: This is a very poor attempt to meld two very good stories: ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" (1935 and 1962)* and ""Run Silent, Run Deep"" (1958), both of which are excellent films. This is simply modern tripe (tripe can be both meat or something useless, which is why I call these types of films all meat, no nutrients).

It has scant ""character development"" and it's ""story"" is hollow ... yes, like a sub. There's endless male choral / epic-sounding music, and proficient use of the ""f"" bomb, but that's it. Endless music is a near-guarantee that a film lacks substance, even among the classics I love so much.

* Note: Both are excellent and very well acted. The question is do you prefer Gable or Brando?

ACTING: You'd expect solid acting from Washington and Hackman, and they deliver. But that's all you get.

Neither is giving us anything new in range of character quality, just the same personalities in different costumes.

ENTERTAINMENT: For males who want constant tension and testosterone, this is for you. Otherwise, value is low.

TEMPO: OK, I suppose

CINEMATOGRAPHY: It's the inside of a submarine ...

DIRECTING / WRITING: Director: Tony and brother Ridley (not on this film) churn out the same male-oriented drivel, over and over ... ad nausea. On a rare occasion one of them delivers something interesting, e.g. ""Enemy of the State"" (1998), ""Alien"" (1979), ""Black Hawk Down"" (2001). Between them, Ridley appears the far more capable. But as a whole, the cache of their work is fairly predictable and is confined to a sliver of genre.

Writers: Both writers have very small portfolios, and there's not much in those to speak of, if at all.

Is it a good film? Yes, and no

Should you watch this once? Maybe

Rating: 7.0 (not a drop more)"
Crumb (1994),"Roger Ebert gave ""Crumb"" four stars, so we rented it. According to his review, the filmmaker, Terry Zwigoff, has known Robert Crumb for many years, and was as depressed and suicidal during the making of the film as Robert Crumb has been at times in his life.

Robert Crumb is a true, tortured eccentric, who found salvation in his art; the fact that he also found fame is almost secondary. By contrast, his brothers, Charles and Max, are basket cases. They were the children of an active monster (their father) and a passive, colluding monster (their mother). There were two sisters, who declined to participate in this film. As Mad Magazine was of the Fifties, so Zap Comics and Robert Crumb's cartoons and artwork were subversive, anarchic emblems of the psychedelic Sixties, although as the film abundantly details, he himself was never really of that world.

After half an hour of this film, we were saying, ""Wow, how fascinating!"" After an hour, we were saying, ""Okay, I've seen enough of Charles and Max."" After an hour and a half, we were pleading, ""Have mercy!"" By the end of this two-hour film, we were feeling as if we'd been tortured by burial under heavy rocks. We came to the end with great relief.

I instinctively understand Robert Crumb, but two hours of Crumb's profound cynicism, his indefatigable negativity, his misanthropy and misogyny, his interminable kvetching---not to mention the ramblings of his brothers and various friends, former lovers and associates---is about an hour too long. A skillful editor could take this material and cut it down to a one-hour special for cable that would be a masterpiece. As it is, it drags on and on and on and on and on and on. Too much of anything, even Robert Crumb, is too much."
Desperado (1995),"In this edition of ""Sequels Better than the First"" we have ""Desperado"" which was definitely better than ""El Mariachi."" It had better lighting, sound, picture, script, actors, etc. ""Desperado"" joins movies such as ""Godfather II,"" ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" ""T2,"" and ""Robocop 2"" just to name a few sequels better than their predecessors.

The no-named Mariachi player is now being played by Antonio Banderas. He is after Bucho (Joaquim de Almeida), the big boss who was pulling the strings when his old flame was killed. He will go from town to town and bar to bar leaving a trail of dead bodies in order to find Bucho.

Helping him is his friend played by Steve Buscemi. Also helping him is his new flame, Carolina (Salma Hayek). Like I said, upgrades all around.

This is a shoot 'em up action flick with a Mexican flare. It's somewhat of a throwback to Spaghetti Westerns, yet in modern day. Looking purely at body count and bullet count, this movie could be virtually indistinguishable from your typical Hollywood action movie. But, just the subtle change of location, accents, and substituting white faces for brown faces and suddenly the new packaging makes the entire product better."
"Doom Generation, The (1995)","""The Doom Generation"" is quite possibly the worst film ever made. I stand by this statement very strongly, for this is the third film I have watched by ""director"" Greg Araki - ""The Living End"" and ""Nowhere"" being the others. Araki has made an offensive, horrendously written (dialogue example: ""Shut up hamburger face!""), poorly directed film in ""The Doom Generation."" It's one of those pictures that knows it's trying to be cool and wants the younger, angst-ridden generation it attempts to portray to buy into such low-rate shock value(Example: Each time the characters enter a convenience store, someone is killed.). Each of the three leads in the film are completely unlikable and poorly acted and they know it - note the terrible over-acting by James Duval. The word ""subliminal"" is something Araki needs to look up as he douses his composition with such over-the-top ""symbolism"" - Every time they order something at the convenience store the price comes to $6.66. Get it? Ho-hum. It's enough to make one puke. Araki has absolutely no respect or passion for his craft and even less for his audience. In a Premiere magazine interview, when asked what advice he would give to young, aspiring filmmakers he responded, ""Don't do it."" He acts as if to offend his audience is a chore when it is obvious that he wants so desperately to get a rise out of us with such cheap shock-value. All of this is offensive, low-rate drivel. It wants the teen generation to think that they are doomed and to immerse themselves in such fake, melo-dramatic angst. This is a film that wants to give kids an excuse to shoot their classmates. It creates problems that never existed in the first place by romanticizing the alienated attitudes of many teens. This is Araki's only mission in ""The Doom Generation."" It can be seen just as clear in the aforementioned ""The Living End"" and ""Nowhere."" The film is a mess from start to finish, a total hack job. Greg Araki is the an entire level below fimmakers like Ed Wood, who at least had passion for the crap he produced. Hope Araki sleeps well at night. Or let's hope he stops making films... forever."
Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home (1995),"I didn't loved FREE WILLY but still like it very much and consider it a childhood classic thanks to the many times it was overplayed on channel 6 during my childhood. The sequels were aired often during my childhood but strictly in that period because in fact I didn't remembered them that much and last March I finally re-watched the first of these sequels. After 15 years (saw it the first time in 2009) I found it slightly inferior to the original but still not that bad as some of the reviewers say.

After Willy jumped for freedom at the end of the first one the Greenwoods (Michael Madsen and Jayne Atkinson) are planning a vacation in San Juan for camping and visiting Randolph (August Schellenberg) but before that Dwight Mercer (Mykelti Williamson) arrives with the news that Jesse's mom was found dead in New York and left another son. Jesse's step-brother Elvis (Francis Capra) is very loquacios and troublesome and grates on Jesse's nerves. Once in San Juan, Jesse reunites with Randolph and go to see Willy and his orca family.

Soon after oil tanker Dakar has an accident and loses oil thanks to a malfunction in the engine trapping Willy and his family in the process. Luna ends on the beach and the Greenwoods manage to return her to water and the Benbrook Oil CEO John Milner (Jon Tenney) promise to help the whales go in another zone. Elvis, that escaped because Annie didn't respected her promise, in a bar hears from afar a conversation between Milner and Bill Wilcox (M. Emmet Walsh) that their real plan is to sell the whales to zoos and so he rushes to the camp for warning Jesse and Glen. After throwing Milner and Wilcox in the water they manage to save the whales after also surviving a fire caused by the oil, and in this occasion Willy will take Jesse on the ground so that the parents can retrieve him. Some time later, Elvis makes amends to Jesse saying that his mum talked well about him and she was sorry for everything, and this convinces Jesse to have Elvis as his step-brother. Soon before the end credits, we see the orca family of Willy, Luna and Catspaw swimming together.

The plot doesn't look bad and I loved the settings. But what prevented me to give a higher score was the major annoyance of Elvis. He was so loquacious, so annoying and so whiny that I really couldn't stand him and if it wasn't for the other actors' performances and the happy ending I would have given this a 3 because of him. I would have preferred that when Elvis accidentally fell in the water Willy should have left him there, he was THAT annoying! I would say more but IMDB won't allow it.

As for the rest of the cast, they were all good (Madsen, Williamson, Schellenberg, Tenney, Al Sapienza, John Considine and the late Walsh) with the material given. And the moments before the end with the helicopter trying to rescue the kids looked like something picked straight from the DIE-HARDs and considering that this is a family movie, it's fitting since the first DIE-HARD is considered an unintentional Christmas movie.

Overall, not a terrible sequel nor family movie (and trust me, I have seen much MUCH worse) but one that could have been much better if it wasn't for the major annoyance of the step-brother. But if you like or love the first one, this would please you in a similar manner."
Nadja (1994),"In New York City Nadja, her brother and their slave come to terms with the murder of their father by Van Helsing. Meanwhile the girlfriend of Helsing's nephew, Jim, is taken as a drone by Nadja. Jim and Van Helsing set out to stop the reign of the Dracula family and stop their blood lust.

I didn't even know this was about the Dracula legend when I sat to watch it, just the title drew me and the cast sounded quite promising. The black and white, shaky shots, post modern slant and grainy camera work were both a draw and a turn off for me. On one hand it was very arty, deliberately sticking a finger up to the mainstream. I dislike this feeling - one that the multiplex crowd are unworthy of any film and that the director wouldn't care to have their film be successful and hence uses such things with abandon. However it also made the film much more imaginative and interesting if it had all been full Technicolor with steadicam and nicely framed shots, it was pretty hip and I enjoyed it even if I felt like it was aimed at the art crowd rather than just being a film for anyone or everyone.

The story is quite good, albeit just a twist on the old story of Dracula. The script is where the main difference lies. It is quite talky a film but it is better for it. The dialogue is a little pretentious at times but it is interesting and involving. In terms of characters I'm afraid it falls down quite badly - the grainy images and dialogue that is far from `down to earth' stop the characters from ever being real people or even characters that I felt deeply involved in - but happily it wasn't to the point that I was completely disinterested in them. That's not to say it was great - but it was different enough to keep me interested, even if I wasn't gripped by it at any point. Likewise with the direction, I felt there was imagination but that it went too far to the point of just being experimental and arty for the sake of it. If you are making a film with as good a cast as this had then why on earth would you use a child's camera unless you were trying to be arty? This mindset did feel through the whole film and it was, as I've already said, a pretty big turn off for me.

The cast is great on paper but they struggle with the pretentious dialogue and the fact that the film loses them in a grainy black & white world. I will always watch Donovan but that doesn't mean he's any good. Here he is alright but has precious little to actually do! Fonda is better and plays his character with a sense of humour that the wider film could well have benefited from - I wonder if the director got annoyed by Fonda not playing it straight when he clearly had arty aspirations. Lowensohn is not only beautiful but acts well in the title role but the astonishingly named Galaxy Craze was pretty much cardboard as Lucy.

Overall this is an interesting movie but it struggles under the weight of it's own pretensions. I found it to be different enough visually and script-wise to be interesting and even I found the apparent concerted effort to alienate the mainstream to be slightly off putting. An interesting effort but one that will irritate far more viewers than it will please."
"Net, The (1995)","Floppy disks? Dial up modems? To name just a couple of things. I suppose one of the problems of making movies that in any way revolve around technology is that technology evolves, and what seems cutting edge can quickly start to seem old fashioned. That's certainly the case with ""The Net."" Sandra Bullock did a passable job as Angela Bennett - a computer analyst of some sort who basically lives on ""The Net."" She works from home; she never interacts with anyone apparently except through computers. The only exception seems to be her mother, but her mother has Alzheimer's and doesn't know who she is. In 1995 the chat rooms and ""the best pizza in cyberspace"" and sending ""electronic mail"" probably would have seemed cutting edge to a lot of people. Less than 20 years later (and actually long before this) it's just really, really dated technology with rather grainy computer graphics - along with the aforementioned floppy disks and dial up modems. At times it's hard to get around that and settle into this movie.

And yet, at the same time, there's a strangely prophetic feel to this as well. I mean, in 1995 somebody made a movie that revolved exclusively around issues of identity theft and cyberterrorism - both very real concerns 20 years later. Not a bad job of gazing into the crystal ball, I'd say.

Angela gets caught up in a conspiracy by a group that seems to be trying to crash pretty much every computer system going. I have to admit that the plot came across at times as a bit convoluted. I wasn't entirely clear on the goals of the cyberterrorists; what they were hoping to accomplish. But they certainly did a good job of messing with Angela's life. While on vacation she meets and falls for a mysterious man who's part of the conspiracy. The conspirators then stole her identity and gave it to one of their own; they replaced her identity with that of a woman wanted by the police for a series of felonies. Basically her entire life was wiped out and replaced by a life she knew nothing about and that put her on the run, with nowhere to go for help. That was well done, and pretty smart. Her goal, of course, is to reveal the plot and regain her life.

There's some good action; and some rather clich√© ""chase"" scenes involved. It stretches the bounds of credibility a bit, I think, by suggesting that there's hardly a person in the entire world who could vouch for who Angela really is. She's honestly had no contact with anyone? She spends every moment of every day in her apartment on a computer? If so, why did she go on vacation in the first place? Clearly she likes getting out. And her mother was in some sort of institution, and Angela clearly visited. Maybe her mother doesn't know her, but wouldn't some staff member of the institution know who she was? And wouldn't the company that sends her the ""best pizza in cyberspace"" have to have someone deliver it to her? There must have been someone who had seen her.

So, credibility's lacking a little bit, and this does have a bit of a quaint, old-fashioned feel to it. But Bullock is OK, and there's enough excitement in this to keep you watching. (6/10)"
Strange Days (1995),"I guess James Cameron made action films better for all of us. Not just for the audience, but for the actors and the people involved in the movies too. He even smashed the gender barrier in the world of action movies and gave us the toughest females ever (Sarah Connor, Ellen Ripley, Helen Tasker, and Lindsay Brigman). And in 1995 he wrote up a screenplay that had a really fascinating story about the impending millennium and he called it ""Strange Days"". But instead of directing it, he decided to hand over the directing duties to his ex-wife Katheryn Bigelow, who made ""Point Break"" a few years before. And I've gotta say, women have really earned their place in action cinema, and we owe it to good ol' James Cameron.

Strange Days tells the story taking place at the turn of the millennium from the 1000's to the 2000's and from 1999 to 2000. And due to the fact that it's a science fiction film, it features an outlawed device called SQUID that people can use with inserted discs to see, feel and experience an event that someone else already recorded. And a former cop named Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes) who is now a hustler and seller of this device frequently uses the thing that he devotes his life to in order to experience the old memories of his ex-wife. And two other sub-plots emerge when he gets a disc that reveals corruption in the LAPD and another that shows a serial killer stalking, raping and murdering women. And it all finally converges at the end.

Two years after playing the heartless Nazi Amon Goeth in ""Schindler's List"", Ralph Fiennes shows a completely different side of him in here. His character Lenny Nero is basically a vulnerable, weak guy who happens to be a lying, deceiving and vain hustler and due to his occasional silliness, it's almost impossible to see the negative aspects of his personality. He's also quite stubborn and a fool for love since his ex-wife chose fortune and fame over him. And Fiennes was perfectly cast here due to his skill of conveying several personality traits into a character. Also, his character is somewhat unique since he isn't really as macho and he seems to be more feminine due to his clothing style of silk and spandex. And we all know we can't keep ripping-off other movie characters to be make a profit, and ""Strange Days"" does the opposite. It does what it should do to get originality.

My favorite acting performance in here was, without a doubt, Angela Basset as Mace. We all know that James Cameron constantly puts tough female characters in his films, but Mace in ""Strange Days"" takes the cake! She serves as Lenny's bodyguard and provides a couple cool fight scenes. Mace used to be an average woman and then her husband got arrested and when he started doing time, Mace completely changed and became more masculine, kinda like Sarah Connor between the first two Terminator movies.

Tom Sizemore, who is a Bigelow regular, is great as Lenny's best pal and Juliette Lewis is great as Nero's ex-wife and she provides a realistic portrayal as the hot woman who wants nothing but money and could care less for morality and love. She also does some great singing in a couple scenes when she's performing with her band. And the dirty cop Steckler played by Vincent D'Onofrio before his Law and Order days, is played flawlessly and he's a pretty scary guy and he's willing to do anything to cover up what he and his partner did (although I'm not gonna tell exactly what in this review, you'll have to watch and find out).

""Strange Days"" has got it all; action, science fiction, suspense, and romance. The SQUID things were really something cool, original and creative, and it would be even better if it was really invented someday. This isn't really as action-packed as James Cameron's movies tend to be like, since it's got a different director, but the vision of Los Angeles is just remarkable, there's arson fires and riots packed in almost every scene and its just horrifying. Even though it hasn't happened yet, it makes you think and it makes you worry, especially if you're foolish enough to be living in LA.

And remember, a woman actually made one of the greatest action adventures of all time. Katheryn Bigelow, we salute you."
"To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar (1995)","On the plus side, this film has a wonderful cameo by Robin Williams and Patrick Swayze proves he could successfully step into the lead role of any regional production of ""Auntie Mame."" After that, one can pick this film apart piece by piece.

But here are a few of the film's major problems: 1) Drag queens do not dress in drag 24/7. And certainly they do not sleep in drag. Drag is a costume, something worn as part of a show, an alternate identity. In fact the film would have been more interesting if we had got to know the characters in their everyday life as a contrast to their drag identities. But placing the guys in drag and keeping them there keeps them safely in the realm of a sight gag. The characters are not people, they are extented jokes.

2) This is a film about how gay men make the world nice for heterosexual lovers. This would have been truly ground-breaking if it had been about the romantic lives of this trio, not just portraying them, literally, as fairy godmothers who come to work romantic magic for straights. 3) The film is sexist. The trio come to this small town and teach men how to show respect by beating them up and solve all the women's problems by giving them self-esteem inducing makeovers. Men are villains and get violence; women are victims and get pampering. And, of course, gays earn the right to be ""fabulous."" Wouldn't it be interesting if someone made a film where women are taught to respect men and men were pampered their way to self-esteem? That'll never happen.

Sadly, ""Wong Foo"" truly thinks it is being bold and original, but every step of the way it falls back on clich√©s and tiresome stereotypes."
Billy Madison (1995),"This was on TV last night, and I watched it on the strength of the reviews here at imdb.com. I am AMAZED that so many people liked this pustulent, fetid, rancid discharge of a film. Its lack of comedy is only equalled by its immaturity and pointlessness. There is no acting, no humour, and a plot so thin I can only wonder how it survives holding the weight of its own rancid patheticness. I was literally slack jawed with shock at how bad this film is. I was frustrated with sorrow for the people who actually liked this - one reviewer says that he / she was laughing out loud. At what? How films like this ever get released? How Adam Sandler still has a career after this moronic turd of a film? Just awful. Dont say I did not warn you. By the way, this is only the 2nd review I have written on imdb.com. Generally I feel little need to, as previous posters sum up (generally) the pros and cons of a film very well, but I feel in this case, the public should be warned. I cannot BELIEVE there are so many good reviews for this film, and the truth needs to be told. I am actually offended that this rubbish got greenlighted, made and released, where actual (would be) decent films never see production.

Shocking."
Clerks (1994),"Rarely is a script so clearly the star of a movie, but ""Clerks"" is clearly a product of the unique mind behind it, Kevin Smith. This is a filmmaking debut with a clear idea of what it wants to say and how it wants to say it, namely in the form of casual conversation that ranges from profane to profound.

The vessels by which these thoughts and ideas are delivered go by the names of Dante (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson), 22-year-old New Jersey convenience and video store clerks, respectively, who are pals despite drastically different attitudes toward their ""dead-end"" jobs. The film predominantly follows Dante over the course of a day at the Quick Stop, a day that he was never supposed to work in the first place. In addition to persistent stop- ins from Randal, he is visited by/chats with his girlfriend, Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti), grapples with the news about of a couple other ex-girlfriends and deals with a host of unusual customers, not to mention the shady characters who hang out outside the store including Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith).

""Clerks"" plays out as ""scenes at a convenience store"" for the majority of its runtime to the point that it could've been a play and almost worked just as well. Film, however, feels more fitting; there's something about the context of this actual dinky convenience store location and the way Smith carefully selects his shot angles in each scene (shot in black and white) that brings everything together. The ""theater"" would betray the down-to-earth New Jersey reality of it all, even though so much of the film centers on dialogue.

What Smith is able to convey in a series of conversations, most filmmakers have to construct elaborate scenes in order to communicate. He can take a conversation about blowjobs or something even more inane and turn it into something much bigger. That's a hell of a skill. The only pitfall is that none of the actors can reel in the cleverness and timing of Smith's words. In some scenes the acting sort of just dissipates leaving only dialogue ‚Äì these poor actors have to make these quip-filled exchanges sound like natural banter between minimally educated middle-class slackers.

Nevertheless, the script carries ""Clerks"" to the notoriety Smith has earned over the last couple decades. It's an entertaining tennis match of dialogue that's sharp, occasionally satirical and most importantly, taps into the core of what young people struggling to do something with their lives all feel. And he doesn't just go there with the conversations; he illustrates it in the various seemingly mundane dilemmas and conflicts Dante encounters through the course of his day.

Maybe most significantly of all, Smith speaks for the outcast in ""Clerks."" He speaks for the guy living in his parents' basement, the guy working a convenience store job, the guy who spends his days loitering outside convenience stores or playing street hockey and other characters society frowns upon for not ""doing anything with their lives."" He points out that despite their disregard for societal protocols, they still have smart things to say and above all, like ""the rest of us,"" still yearn for meaning in their lives.

Disclosure (1994),"1994's Disclosure shows viewers to a subject and issue that is coming more and more common in the workforce and society that is sexual harassment. You have Michael Douglas as a computer executive Tom Sanders, who rejects the advanced passion of his new boss an old-flame played perfect by the hot and sexy Demi Moore. Only to find out later that his whole life and career is on the line when he's accused of sexual harassment, the tables are turned only as he later finds out this is all a game of company conspiracy and sexual politics, the Sanders character is one you cheer for to win his lawsuit and career. I'm thankful for Barry Levinson and Michael Crichton who show with this film that sexual harassment can come from a female instead of a male. Men are sometimes wrongly stereotyped as the predators instead of the prey, and that many women in the workforce have ego problems and power trips just like the Moore character. Disclosure is a good movie not a great movie that shows women can be just as guilty as men with issues like sexual harassment, and remember be careful and stay away from a female with a little bit of given power."
Dolores Claiborne (1994),"Stephen King+ Kathy Bates is a winning combination. Though unlike Misery, this movie is not focusing on the horror aspect.

There is some shocking violence in this movie, but it's not the main thing. If you're looking for action look somewhere else. If you're looking for a great drama with a wonderful cast then this is your movie.

I just loved it! Stephen King is a master of story-telling as the past and present unfold in front of our eyes and we get one piece of the puzzle at the time up to the great climax at the end.

Taylor Hackford also did a great job directing this movie. There are some really cool visual effects quite similar to what Hackford did later in ""Devil's Advocate"" two years later."
Eat Drink Man Woman (1994),"To make the long story short, in this movie is shown the cycle of life: youth, maturity, old age, and how interact between them, with its ups and downs. Family, love, agreements, disagreements, relationships, friendship, birth and death.

  Despite the generational gaps, there is a common ground: the art of cooking, which appears as the silent and dispassionate observer which brings people and families together, and around which the life cycle unfolds.

Quite apart from this, i am an Asian food lover and this movie was a torture since i saw it with my empty stomach. Cooked meals depicted in the film are the epitome of culinary delight. One can do nothing but feeling irresistibly tempted by this festival of colors and flavors.

Probably they had hired traditional Chinese/Taiwanese food professional cooks.

Having said that, I turn off my computer, and go to dinner to a Korean restaurant next door to my place. : )

Exotica (1994),"Atom Egoyan's ""Exotica"" is perhaps the most perfect and beautifully intricate film I have seen. Filmed on a $2 million Canadian budget with his mostly usual staple of actors it explores territory usually left unchartered in the film world.

Francis Brown (Bruce Greenwood) is a tax auditor for Revenue Canada who makes nightly visits to Exotica, a local gentleman's club, where he also asks for his favorite dancer, Christina (Mia Kirschner). The activity of the club is told to us by Eric, the D.J. (Elias Koteas)who makes suggestive comments about the dancers. The club is owned by the pregnant Zoe (Arsinee Khanjian; Egoyan's wife). The other main character of the story is Thomas Pinto (Don McKellar), a latently gay pet shop owner being audited by Francis.

The film is largely about replacements and rituals. Eric used to be Christina's lover and relives the relationship through MCing suggestive fantasies of her. The club used to be owned by Zoe's mother and she is taking her mother's place since it's easier than creating her own options. Francis has his niece (Sarah Polley) babysit while he's gone, even though there's no baby to sit and pays her $20 a night and pays Christina $5 a dance. Thomas goes to the opera on a regular basis and scalps tickets in order to meet up with other men. The film doesn't truly come together until the conclusion where everything makes sense.

This film features some great performances, especially Bruce Greenwood as the troubled and intense Francis. Elias Koteas is equally good as the jealous DJ. This is a sorely underrated film with the essentials of a masterpiece. The score is also excellent and I highly recommend the soundtrack as well.

Overall, one of my all-time favorite films. A must-see."
Ed Wood (1994),"Although I had never heard of Ed Wood before hearing of this film, I now understand why anybody would even consider making a film about him. Even though branded as ""the worst director of all time,"" Wood was refreshingly passionate about what he did. Of course, I can't really judge his work, but from what I saw in this movie I'm pretty sure that the critics are right about him.

But that's not the point of Ed Wood. Not at all. My favorite scene in the whole movie is the conversation between Wood and Orson Welles. One perhaps the best filmmaker of his time, the other a young, struggling filmmaker without experience or talent, but each knows what the other is going through. They have the same problems and the same ambitions. The fact that one is a genius and the other a total failure is only secondary.

The performances are all first-rate, starting with Depp and Landau and going all the way to the supporting cast which includes a great performance by Bill Murray. Opposing Ed Wood's statement that ""filmmaking is not about the tiny details,"" Tim Burton gave us another great film filled with wonderful details.

The film does not go into detail about Wood's experiences prior to and after making his first films which is understandable when you make a little research on this very website.

This film made me curious about Ed Wood's work and maybe I'll get over myself and check out Plan 9 from Outer Space or Glen or Glenda.

Hoop Dreams (1994),"I'll never understand the USA's obsession with high school sports. Putting this much pressure on 14-18 year old kids and calling them athletes and referring to their basketball as a 'career' is harmful. Sure, it's an entertaining game but that's all it is. Once business takes over all bets are off and lives are ruined. The promise of the American dream of wealth and success is nothing but a bald-faced lie. These topics were briefly touched on but for the most part the movie was a rather passive documentary that simply chronicled two different boys' lives in high school basketball for four years. That in itself was interesting enough for me to give this movie a good rating. The people are compelling and it was good to know that eventually at least one of the boys came to realize that his NBA dreams were unrealistic. The movie still presents a powerful portrayal of the lower-class inner city blacks in America and the desperation they have to endure. One of the only outs for their kids seems to be sports scholarships. Enter the over-zealous coach, competitive scouts and legions of fans. It's interesting to see because no one in Canada is as obsessed with high school sports. I think it's mainly because it's the only way out for poor, inner-city blacks in America. The concept makes for an entertaining, emotional documentary."
Legends of the Fall (1994),"When I first saw the movie poster and the actors that was involved, I was expecting a pretty good story. In that department I was disappointed, it's basically a narrow love story that is clich√© and very formulaic. The constant emotional or dramatic music that plays in almost every scene starts to get annoying after a while as well. The main highlight of this film is the young Brad Pitt and the makers of this movie knows this as well, and not because his character stood out or anything. But because it's the type of movie where the handsome man rides in with his horse and gets the female audiences to drool. The movie is basically about three brothers falling for the same girl and all the drama that goes with it. The story is also very slow moving and gets tedious after a while, I enjoy some romance movie but I can't really say I really enjoyed this one all that much. The pacing is awkward like some scenes were cut due to length, so I assume the book to probably be better. Some critics claim this movie is poetic, but I just found it mostly corny.

"Madness of King George, The (1994)","A superlative drama. By now, most sophisticated movie-goers are aware that King George III's sickness might very well have been a result of porphyria, a hereditary disease that some doctors have traced back to Mary, Queen of Scots (i.e., George III's great-great-great-great-great grandmother). Whatever the cause, Nigel Hawthorne gives the performance of a lifetime as the tortured king. The conflict between George III and his heir, the Prince of Wales (the eventual King George IV), is brutally and unapologetically portrayed: the director does not spare us in his vivid reenactment of the combative and sour relationship that actually existed between the two men. As an American, one might suspect I'd be unsympathetic to the British monarch who presided over England's attempt to brutalize its colonies -- but George III's almost-wistful resentment of his errant ""colonists"" generates some sympathy for the man himself - a sympathy which is unexpectedly intensified by Hawthorne's sudden descent into incoherence, his dim, yet aching realization of what he has become, and his eventual recovery. George III was haunted by demons not of his own making; and no human being deserves the fate to which his disease, if such it was, eventually condemned him. ""The Madness of King George"" enlightened, entertained,and provoked: what more could one ask of a film?"
Natural Born Killers (1994),"Don't get me wrong because of the one-line summary. I think Stone is a very good overall director (Platoon comes to mind), but Natural Born Killers is his all-time worse movie.

It's not that I mind extreme violence. I'm a giant fan of Tarantino, and his script on the movie is obviously intelligent and witty. When it comes to the script, this movie is absolutely fine. But when it comes to the directing...

I don't know what happened to Stone when he directed it. Maybe he was half-asleep, in a bad mood or just was tempted by the devil. But anyway, this movie has been turned by his inept direction into a juggernaut. A sinking juggernaut.

The switches of color to black and white, the insane delusions, the below average soundtrack, the twisted colors, the worst joke ever in a movie - the absolutely stupid sitcom spoof, which is dumber then ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"", which does make you crack in laughter - but because you are laughing at the director's stupidity.

Once again, Stone is a great director. But I don't know what happened to him.

P.S. If Tarantino would have directed it, it would surely be a masterpiece. I ranked it 6 because of the great script and solid performances."
Outbreak (1995),"For years I avoided this film like¬Ö well¬Ö the plague. My inner critic informed me that it was just more Hollywood pap purpose built for the guileless and those less discerning. I should listen to my inner critic more¬Ö Sam Daniels (Dustin Hoffman), Casey (Kevin Spacey) and Saul (Cuba Gooding Jr) are a team of highly trained (and Oscar winning) army scientists. When they identify that an extremely lethal and highly contagious virus known as the Motaba strain has somehow made it to the continental United States they immediately relay news of the threat up the line of management. Only it seems that for some reason the powers that be ‚Äì among whose numbers are Billy (Morgan Freeman) and McClintock (Donald Sutherland) ‚Äì ain't listening, despite all the evidence, scientific graphs, diagrams and powerpoint charts that practically demand to the audience that they should.

By the way all of the above have perfectly legitimate army ranks, but in a film this silly I like to refer to them as Sam, Billy and co¬Ö Sam thinks that this new virus is reeeeeelllll bad, he tells his ex Robbie (Rene Russo), who is now a civilian scientist. Robbie initially ignores him just as Billy did, but when some gooey, pus-filled evidence oozes his way into her view she becomes more sympathetic to his claims, yet even with the mounting body count Billy and his superiors stubbornly dig in their heels, place their fingers in their ears and sing ""la-la-la-la-la-laaaaaa"" to drown out the facts ‚Äì even when a small town in *gasp* heartland America becomes threatened by mass contagion.

Sam, Saul and Casey show up and start dispensing with both assistance and claims that things will only get worse to anyone who will listen ‚Äì which appears to be no-one. Billy arrives on the scene to demand no more talk about this bizarre cover-up, and a cast of mostly good (and in many cases award winning) actors wallow in this mediocrity for another 90 minutes of ennui.

As Sam and Saul go to increasingly great lengths to solve the case and find the cure things get altogether nonsensical, especially once they realise the 'carrier' is a tiny illegal immigrant monkey from Africa, lost somewhere in one of the 50 some landlocked states.

As the virus mutates, morphs and generally becomes more aggressive, the 'management' spout speeches and assorted tripe with buzzwords like 'quarantine', 'containment' and 'eradication', and even if Cuba Gooding Jr said ""Show me the monkey!"" I wouldn't have been surprised.

Alas he didn't, as it might have given me my one and only chuckle in this interminably long and exponentially sillier dross. Another clich√©d button pusher purpose built to scare the gormless and all too trusting.

I recently watched Daylight, another carefully calculated Hollywood built manipulator designed to provoke a response. But that was actually quite well done, a thousand times better than this microscopic bug driven crap. So instead of saying I'd rather watch Daylight a dozen times rather than this I'll say I'd rather watch any of Sly's crappier films a dozen times than this again¬Ö OK maybe not 'Stop! Or my Mom will Shoot'¬Ö

Final Rating ‚Äì 4.5 / 10. If you can't guess that I think this film sucks by now I don't know what to tell you. So instead of a neat summation I'll merely add this fun fact: Kevin Spacey rocks the worst dyed wig of any actor I think I have ever seen in this movie."
"Professional, The (1994)","I first saw this in the late 90s. Then again in the mid 2k on a dvd i own.

Revisited the remastered extended version last night with my family.

This movie is more than just a hitman or an assassin movie.

The music is top notch, the characters are very well developed, the action scenes n direction are stylish.

But the best part are the scenes between Reno n Portman. Leon is amazingly n very differently portrayed by Reno.

There is a Bollywood copy known as Bichoo (Scorpio).

The only thing good in the Bollywood movie is that the guy who played Tony gives away all of the hitman's money to the girl whereas in the original, the character of Tony gives only a single currency note to Mathilda n keeps blabbing the same ""safer than the usual bank story""."
Priest (1994),"Priest, by Antonia Bird, is very beautiful and also provocative film about faith, church, forgiveness and tolerance, which all have as many shapes as there are human beings. The film tells the story of a priest who arrives to new town and soon he notices some things he don't consider too acceptable, and learns also that incredible and selfish evil lives inside every human being, including himself.

The film is a powerful study about religion and many ways to interpret and obey its orders. How can a priest do his ""good"" job as he is rotten and evil inside and there is always the chance of Sin lurking somewhere? The main point is that no human is purely good and without any flaws and everyone sins, priests too. The purification can be reach only by forgiving and being tolerant and loving towards others, and thus the peace of mind and happiness may be reached: trying to be as good as human being can. Forgiveness and love are the most important things and the film ends in extremely beautiful scene at the church, as at least one little person forgives the priest for his ""crimes"" and sees into the heart and soul of the priest. We cannot judge someone for something because there are no sinless people in the world. The narrow-mindedness is one problem the film deals with, and it is sad to see that these things take place in real life, too. The film is very deep and beautiful and also funny and it unfolds more and more with each viewing time. This should be seen by persons who ""cannot forgive"" someone for something he/she has done. What is the benefit people think they get by not forgiving someone and hating someone? As I mentioned, the power of love, forgiveness, and tolerance are the main themes of the film so there are no people in the world, who this film cannot be recommended. This is like Abel Ferrara's and his screenwriter's work, but not as fierce and relentless as their work. Priest is a little more restrained and ""easier for everyone to watch"" version of the themes of Ferrara and St. John.

Remarkable, beautiful, touching and forces the viewer to think. 9/10 masterpiece."
Quiz Show (1994),"In the 1950's the law didn't protect as a good as it does today. Quiz Show movie was shown to the public in 1994. It dramatizes about the scandals in the show Twenty One because there was discrimination with Herbert Stemple who was a humble and smart person (nerd). In the Twenty One game, Herbert was playing with an opponent. In that game the host was Jack Barry who asked the questions to the contestants. They played for points, so the person who scored highest won the game. In that game Herbert won $64,000 dollars and after that he was still winning various games.

The producers, who were Dan Enright and Albert Freedman, were seeing that the program didn't show the ratings that they wanted, so they expected that was for the nerdy guy who had a poor appearance. So Dan Enright and Albert Freedman contacted Van Doren, who was handsome with a good appearance, and was a college professor in the Columbia University. The producers met with him before the show to tell him that they were going to give him the answers because they wanted him to be the protagonist for all the shows. At the same time they talked to Herbert to tell him that if he lost the game they are going to put him in another show. So they played. When Barry asked him the last question and Herbert knew it, but he missed the answer and obviously Van Doren won.

Van Doren was winning a lot of shows and making a lot of money in the easy way called FRAUD. Then appeared Dick Goodwin, who was an idealistic Congressional lawyer, and he got access to Van Doren. He was visiting him for several times and Goodwin started to suspect about why Van Doren was wining all the quiz shows. After that Barry was investigated in anywhere to try the proof that the Twenty One show was a fraud. Then Van Doren was tired about that he was doing and in the next show he told the producers that he didn't want to win with their help because it was to be a scandal for him and his family. So he lost the next game. Van Doren went to talk with his father and he was disappointment because his son was embarrassed his family with that fraud.

So, Van Doren was embarrassed and he decided to say the truth in the committee meeting in Washington because he thought that is better for the people felt that he had deceived them. Yet he felt peace inside himself, and the producers were fired for the fraud. The Twenty One show was canceled.

In my opinion, I didn't like the end of the movie because the law didn't work well because nobody went to the jail. If the people do a fraud they have to go to jail because they were wrong. In the movie Van Doren just said, ""I made a mistake and that's all"". And he walked way like he didn't do anything.

In conclusion, sometimes the people don't make the money, the money makes the people"
Three Colors: Red (1994),"British critics were always envious as to how French cinema effortlessly made intelligent films containing a lot of talking. Three Colours: Red was directed and co-written by Polish Kieslowski and is set in Swiss Geneva. Although if you have ever been to Geneva Airport, there is an exit which takes you to French soil.

The film in his heart has two stories that could be interchangeable. Is it a story about the law student Auguste or the experiences of the judge in his younger days?

Valentine is a student and part time model living in Geneva, her boyfriend is in England. She runs over a dog and goes to see the owner, a retired cynical and aloof Judge. She discovers that he uses devices to eavesdrop on his neighbours phone conversations.

One of the neighbour's Karin is the girlfriend of Auguste, the law student who lives near Valentine's house. Although horrified by the Judge's actions she gets to know the Judge and they become friends.

This film was the last of the Three Colours Trilogy and it signifies Fraternity. The characters who are disparate are connected somehow. Auguste and Valentine are neighbours and so is the Judge and Karin. Judge's relationship with a past girlfriend mirrors the unravelling of Auguste's and Karin's.

By the end the characters mingle with some of the characters from the other two films. Kieslowski brings his films full circle.

It is a thoughtful film but it also has lots and lots of talking. Red plays a strong element in the design and cinematography, although it is well made, even elegantly constructed I did find the pace leaden."
Three Colors: Blue (1993),"There's a car crash and a great composer and his daughter are killed. His wife, Juliet Binoche survives.... sort of. She tries to kill herself, but cannot, so she .... puts everything in trust for her mother and her husband's servants, orders the house sold and the proceeds added to the trust, has one night of passion with her husband's colleague, Beno√Æt R√©gent, then leaves. She rents a cheap apartment, spends her time watching other people, and drifts.

She tries to disappear into nothingness. However the world keeps intruding.

Since this is the first of Krzysztof Kieslowski's TROIS COULEURS trilogy, I kept looking at the colors. He's obvious in his palette, using blue for sadness, red for life, and a general sepia wash for the anomie and observational phase of the movie.

Yet to reduce a discussion of this fine movie to the technical tricks of the trade does no justice to its rich story, and the way everything in the world comes together to bring Miss Binoche to a realization of her own place in the world and her own nature. There are some startling realizations along the way, and Kieslowski and Miss Binoche are patient and deliberate in this portrait, teasing the audience into being interested in this character, who seems to be nothing without her husband and child, and desires to be nothing. In the end, I like to think, like Kieslowski and Binoche's Julie, we are all more than we seem."
Three Colors: White (1994),"White is a Polish film in Polish and French with English subtitles. The film is the second series in the Three Colours trilogy which started with the film Blue and ends with Red. The film takes place in France where a man named Karol Karol whose wife Dominique just divorced him. To make matters work Karol's bank account is frozen and he has no money and no place to go. In the subway he meets a man named Mikolaj who helps him get back to his homeland of Poland. Karol eventually gets there, but not the way he planned on. Once he gets to Poland some friends help him get back on his feet and establish himself. Soon he is doing fine, but is still upset over what Dominique did to him. So with some more help he plans a scheme of revenge to get back at her. Winner of The Silver Berlin Bear for Best Director (Krzysztof Kieslowski, who also co-wrote the film) at The Berlin International Film Festival. White has good direction, a good script, good performances by the entire cast, good original music and good cinematography. White is a very interesting film. From where it started off in the beginning I had no idea how it would end or what would happen next. It kept me following the movie eagerly waiting to see what happened next. It is a very smart and sharp story and the acting and great direction make this film really stand out as well. This film is in no ways similar to Blue, the previous film in the series and I really admire the director for making two totally different films that each work really well. I really loved White because of it's sharp script and because it kept me compelled and interested and I really did not know how it was going to turn out. After these two great films I'm looking forward to completing the series by watching Red. Judging by what I thought of Blue and White, I'm sure I'm going to like Red very much as well."
Stargate (1994),"""Stargate""'s an exciting, high concept science fiction film from Roland (""Independence Day"") Emmerich. With a capable cast, solid script and excellent set design, this is a big-budget adventure for viewers looking for pure escapist fun.

The ever reliable Kurt Russell plays the square-jawed, world weary Jack O'Neil, who is responsible for leading the military mission to another world. James Spader plays the brilliant archaeologist, Dr. Daniel Jackson. At the time, this was a different type of role for Spader and he handles the humorous content of his scenes with great success.

There's also an appearance by ""The Crying Game""'s Jaye Davidson as the evil baddie, Ra. Although Davidson's role is quite small, he brings an other-worldly presence to his part.

The score by David Arnold is excellent.

A great idea for a movie, I can't help but think the concept would have made a successful television series..."
"Santa Clause, The (1994)","Tim Allen plays Scott, a divorced toy executive who spends time with his son on Christmas Eve. They end up in Dennys as he burns the turkey but later that night he hears a sound. It turns out to be Santa who stumbled off the roof and died. Scott is persuaded by his son to don the Santa suit but accidentally invokes the Santa Clause. Scott is obligated to become the new Santa. A strange way to choose a new Santa, if you think about it we have a chain of accidental or unwilling Santa Claus's.

So Scott with reindeer's and sleigh goes out to complete the delivery of the presents on Christmas Eve and he can magically go down chimneys and magical fireplaces appear.

Things go a little Miracle on 34th Street as his son believes his dad is the real Santa. His ex-wife and her new nerdy husband who is also a psychiatrist are sceptical and fight to end Scott's visitation rights. It does not help that Scott has now put on a lot of weight and magically sprouted long grey hair and beard.

The film was a big hit at the box office when it was released. It is a pleasant family film enjoyable by kids, slightly old fashioned but passable CGI effects. I thought the whole visitation rights subplot was rather silly and far fetched."
What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993),"Slightly askew fairy tale from director Lasse Halstrom, who thankfully has abandoned his penchant for overwrought irony and comic nastiness, has a big heart but one that isn't always well-placed. Dedicated to his mentally backward brother and reclusive, overweight mother, grocery worker Gilbert Grape (a nicely understated Johnny Depp) rethinks his life after meeting an attractive young woman passing through town. The film has finely-balanced little moments that spring up at you, however Mary Steenburgen's role as a cheating wife isn't really necessary (it's just there to give us some input into Gilbert's situation), but Juliette Lewis, John C. Reilly and Crispin Glover are very charming as Gilbert's friends. Leonardo DiCaprio...you gotta hand it to him, he pulls off a tricky role with amazing aplomb. Hallstrom's film doesn't always strike the chords it wants to, and occasionally it seems to intentionally wobble while juggling its emotional priorities. Some scenes that should cut deep don't (as with Gilbert shopping at the competition and getting caught by his boss, or with Gilbert letting neighborhood kids get a peek at his mother). Still, a pleasant, thought-provoking outing, one that is nonchalant about its emotions (and its brains). It isn't a heady mix of dramatic ideas, but it does leave you with something--thoughts that may return to you a day or so after seeing it. **1/2 from ****"
While You Were Sleeping (1995),"It's amazing to realize how much the rom-com genre has evolved over the last 10 or 15 years. Compare While You Were Sleeping, for instance, with Must Like Dogs. While still hewing to the traditional rom-com plot arc, the latter has subtlety, wit, depth, and a delicate touch. While You Were Sleeping Does not.

Everything about this movie is predictable, including Bullock's performance. It's interesting to see the earlier work of someone who's been in the business for over 15 years. In her case (as is the case with the bewilderingly overrated Julia Roberts), Bullock seems to have developed a set of pat reactions early on and not strayed too far from them.

The only redeeming feature of this picture is that it's not *completely* insulting to our intelligence. Plus there are some believable, though stock, performances by supporting players. Other than that, it has nothing to offer."
Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994),"I have to say that ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"" is quite unlike any other film. Well excluding any other Jim Carrey movie of course. His manic, rubbery, over-the-top presence is really quite unique and this was the film that announced his talents to the world.

In simple terms this is a whodunnit and really the plot is quite tight and more than sufficient for the movie. The twist is that the story revolves around a stolen dolphin and now I think about it I really don't know why the villain bothered with this cetacean at all. Still they did and that act brings in Ace Ventura.

What he brings is a glorious anarchy, a character who marches to a different beat and does so successfully. Carrey commits to his role absolutely (much like, say, Robin Williams) and that's why the film works. Nothing is held back and you can't help but be swept along.

That doesn't make it a comedy classic but it's a hell of a ride and the jokes just keep on coming. Not all of them land true but by the time that you realise another three gags have been and gone. What a debut!"
"Crow, The (1994)","I can only guess at the age and experience of those who, in other reviews of this movie, have dubbed it ""the best movie ever"". Viewers be forewarned: it isn't, not by a long-shot.

What it is: a comic-genre film - and like most film versions of dark comics, it is enslaved to rain and shadows, candlelight and eyeliner aesthetics, pseudo-intellectualism and faux-poetic moments. It suffers greatly from an unbelievable premise (murderous super bad guys run wild in the streets, doing their will) and mind-numbingly dense dialog.

I watched this movie just recently for the first time - and had to check all the background material on it because I just couldn't believe it was actually shot in the nineties - it is an eighties movie in every way shape and form, hearkening back to the days of the early Cure, Bauhaus, Souxsie and the Banshees, etc.

The acting is flat all around (Brandon Lee spends the entire movie with his chin on his chest, glaring menacingly from underneath his furrowed brow) and what little there is of character is two-dimensional - a comic book view of the world, juvenile and meaningless, trying desperately to be ""deep"".

If Brandon Lee hadn't died during production, this film would be regarded as nothing more than an amusing goth fantasy - and not the goth cult classic it seems to have become. I guess I understand some people's emotional attachment to it, but back when I was being goth and under the influence of nihilist aesthetics, my friends and I read Baudelaire, Sartre and Dostoevsky. To us, a film like this would be as intellectually an emotionally fulfilling as the popcorn you might eat while watching it.

The ""best movie ever""? Sorry. No."
Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994),"Four Weddings and a Funeral is a wonderful movie. Romantic comedies often throw people off because they tend to be cheesy or depressingly sugar-coated. However, this is a truly wonderful movie.

First off, the cast is terrific. They play off of each other wonderfully and it makes for a delightful atmosphere. Just take the lead, Hugh Grant, whose character doesn't appear fit the stereotypical lead at all. The humor is very witty, and the jokes are guaranteed to make you laugh even after you've seen the movie a dozen times.

Situations in the movie are set up to be played out perfectly. In one scene Hugh Grant is at a wedding and is seated with all of his ex-girlfriends. The scene is set up for utter humiliation.

Even with the quick-witted characters, and all the weddings, it wouldn't be a movie without that touch of drama that for many might just get a tear out of them.

Hands down all around great movie to fit most every occasion."
"Mask, The (1994)","Jim Carrey is widely known for a select few movies that he did in the mid to late 90's, along with a couple in the early 2000's. The Mask is one of the most well known of these films. Carrey stars as Stanley Ipkiss, a lowly bank clerk who stumbles upon a mysterious mask that turns him into a maniacal green faced nutcase who has the ability to do anything. The first thing he uses this mask for is to rob a bank, which sets off a whole series of events involving a ruthless band of gangsters and a beautiful night club singer named Tina Carlyle, played by Cameron Diaz in her very first feature film.

Now, despite this being a well known Jim Carrey film, it's also a very bad film. This is where physical humor blows up in your face and becomes unbearably moronic and not funny in the slightest. I honestly feel sorry for the talented and actually funny Jim Carrey for being subjected to such idiocracy in this film. He can't even save the overall pathetic attempts at comedy. The jokes and physical humor in this movie range from absolutely atrocious to almost worth a chuckle, but the latter is far and few between. The majority of this film is just dull and lifeless dribble that wants to be funny but can't find the right chords to stroke. It misses the mark again and again as it becomes more ridiculous and stupid as the film goes on. Needless to say, about ten minutes into the film I couldn't wait for it to end.

The problem with a film like this is that it knows its all about the comedy. It only seeks to deliver funny jokes and entertaining gags, rather than a deep and intellectual storyline and skillfully woven character development. The Mask obviously has neither of the aforementioned things, but it doesn't have the funny to replace them. The only way to really put it is that this is just not a funny movie. It isn't even painful to watch bad, it's just so dull, so lifeless, and so sloppily made and poorly constructed that I can't think anything of it.

I don't want to give the impression that I possess a searing hatred for The Mask, I only want it to be known that it is just not a good film and not something worth watching. It's a waste of an hour and forty minutes, not because it is the worst movie ever made, but because it is so underwhelming and so forgettable that you accomplish absolutely nothing by watching it. There are plenty of other Jim Carrey movies worth checking out before you waste your time with The Mask."
Maverick (1994),"I'm not a huge fan of westerns. I like Clint Eastwood, and I love ""Brisco County Jr."" (which this is very similar to), but I never cared for ""Bonanza"" or ""Gunsmoke"" and I don't know what Gary Cooper looks like. This movie was not a typical western, though, as it sought to make itself fun and added in so many subtle references (especially the ""Lethal Weapon"" nod) to old westerns, country music and Richard Donner films.

Hidden in the movie are Corey Feldman, Margot Kidder, Waylon Jennings, Clint Black and more. I did not recognize them. (Believe me, if I had recognized Corey Feldman I think this film would have received an 8.) Also, the film co-stars James Garner, who was the original Maverick in the TV series.

The plot: Maverick (Mel Gibson) must collect money owed to him to raise $25,000 in order to enter a high-stakes poker tournament on a steamboat. Along the way, he befriends a sheriff (James Garner) and a swindling yet beautiful woman (Jodie Foster). Also, Graham Greene appears.

Seriosuly, the film comes down to an endless series of fun events as Danny Glover parodies his ""Lethal Weapon"" role, Graham Greene plays an unusual Indian, a Russian archduke shows up for no apparent reason and many wacky card games and gun fights ensue. No excessive violence and very mild sex (this is PG, you know) make for a great time without getting too ""adult"".

If you liked the lightheartedness Richard Donner gave to ""Superman"" or ""The Goonies"" and you'd like to see more of that in the Old West, this is the film you are looking to find. Or, as I said, rent the first season of ""Brisco County Jr"" - you'll be pleasantly surprised."
Carlito's Way (1993),"What makes conventions apart (not essential, but always there, like mildew in a shower) of the studio system of movies, as well as in the industry year in and year out, is that they set up the basic track lines for the viewer, to which then he or she can see if the re-treaded storyline will be more impressive than the last movie to take a convention to use. Brian De Palma makes one of his best (and under-rated) films by letting the viewer be as self-aware of the on-coming chiches and pit-falls of the drama the story intones, just by the narration. The aged, contemplative voice of Carlito Brigante (Al Pacino) that chimes in more often than not, is as essential to the way the story unfolds as Henry Hill's was to GoodFellas- this guys been on the inside, he knows the ropes, he knows the stakes, he knows the nature of the beast that goes with the people he associates with, and now that he's out of prison, he doesn't want it anymore. Un-like a lesser film, we start to believe his intentions and reasonings.

Carlito's just been released, thanks in part to his counselor David Kleinfeld (Sean Penn), five years gone in a thirty year sentence, and when he returns to the street many look at him as if he's changed hearing that he's retired. Carlito just wants to get some money together, open a car dealership of sorts with a friend in the Bahamas, and works in a nightclub right smack dab in the heart of the coked up late 70's. As Carlito's tale unfolds, so does Kleinfeld's, as an inmate who's a client of his makes a demand that he can't turn down, which in turn brings a perpetually reluctant Carlito along with him.

Another wise decision on De Palma's part was the casting: Pacino's screen presence is sometimes enough to be intimidating, but his performance as Carlito is the part of the heart of the movie (the other part is with Penelope Ann Miller as his estranged girlfriend), compelling, tough, and intelligent from years of dope dealing and soaking up the gang-land atmosphere around him. Personally, I would put this over Tony Montana any day, if only because the accent rings truer as do his emotions. Then there's Sean Penn as Kleinfeld, a scheming, vain little man who starts off seemingly as legitimate as a lawyer of criminals, but as we soon learn, he has slipped into a world that he has no place to belong in. When I first saw little sections of this movie on TV, previous to recently watching it all the way through, I really didn't know who it was playing Kleinfeld, with his balding, curly hair and nervy, cranked voice appearing like it was Sean Penn, only as Woody Allen if he were ever an attorney. However, when the viewer looks into his eyes, both terrified and ravenous, one can understand the pathway to excess that most conventional crime movies take for granted.

Including supporting work by Penelope Ann Miller and John Leguizamo as the convincing critter Benny from the Bronx, and magnificent set-pieces that confirm De Palma's worth as a director of thrillers as well as dramas, this is an example of Hollywood movie-making that is waiting to be discovered over and over again, as proof of the value that can come in re-fashioning a genre piece."
"Firm, The (1993)","I've always felt that ensemble casts were the best, rather than single-star movies. Apparently, Cruise insisted only his name be at the top of the movie poster, which is unfortunate because the film works not only because of him but the rest of a stellar cast working with a fine screenplay. Along with Cruise, just about every other actor in the cast contributes to this film's success, particularly Jeanne Tripplehorn (who has just about as much screen time as Cruise), Gene Hackman, Holly Hunter, and Wilford Brimley, who plays against type as a ruthless ""Mr. Fix-it"" for the firm. Hunter was nominated for Best Supporting Actress. Honorable mention also goes to Ed Harris, David Strathairn, and Hal Holbrook.

Mitch McDeere is a stellar law student graduating from Harvard. He's being recruited by all the top law firms in the US, focusing on tax and property law. One law firm out of Memphis, TN, Bendini, Lambert & Locke, makes it clear they want him badly, and make him the biggest offer than any other firm (respective of geographic location). In other words, a $100,000/year salary in Memphis is worth about $175,000 in New York.

He and his wife Abby visit Memphis and the law firm, and find out a few strange things. Abby picks up on them but Mitch is rather oblivious. They hang out with another young couple whose husband has also just joined the firm. A couple of little items are mentioned by the other wife, that the firm encourages children and are not against a wife of an associate working. Huh? Since when does a law firm get to approve or disapprove of an associate's family situation? Mitch only sees the good and dismisses the red flags but Abby is concerned.

Despite the red flags, Mitch takes the offer, and the couple move into a nice house furnished by the firm who also puts in their telephones. They're told that the firm does all the telephone installations. Pretty quickly we learn the firm is bugging the McDeeres' household. Then two law firm associates were killed in some kind of a boating accident. Mitch and Abby meet with the young couple they had met during their exploratory visit. Both are distraught with grief.

Mitch is then paired with Avery Tolar (Gene Hackman), his assigned mentor to help with the bar exam. Mitch then learns no one at the firm ever failed the bar exam. Avery takes Mitch to the Cayman Islands to meet with one of their clients, who appears to be a bit sleazy. Who are the firm's clients? At night on the beach at the Cayman's, Mitch makes a behavioral decision which will deepen his commitment to the firm, but on their terms, not his. But that takes on more of an implication when he learns other law firm associates died under mysterious conditions which is confirmed by two FBI guys at a cafe, who inform him that no associate has ever left Bendini, Lambert & Locke alive.

The crucial scene comes when Mitch is given a message at a tax law conference in Washington DC to take a bus to a park. There he meets the agent he met in the cafe and another head agent. He is told his life as he knows it is over. Or is it? The FBI agents want him to steal files from the firm, which include illegal activity of their clients. Unfortunately, if Mitch engages in this behavior, he could jeopardize his future to practice law as this could violate the attorney-client privilege which states that a lawyer cannot reveal incriminating information about his or her client.

The whole point of the film is about how Mitch McDeere must straddle the pressure of the US government, his commitment as an attorney, and his life and relationship with his wife. A thoroughly compelling film from beginning to end. The finale of the film is quite a bit different than the novel, but I somewhat preferred the ending of the film to that of the book. Great performances by the whole cast. Cruise and Tripplehorn have great onscreen chemistry. Strathairn is also compelling as Mitch's brother to whom he reconnects. And Gene Hackman is compelling as the rogue associate at the firm who is allowed to mess around."
Free Willy (1993),"This is certainly one of the films that made an impression on people during the 90's, and that maintained its popularity and sympathy for many years. Today I think it has been forgotten, and in part I feel sorry for it. However, I believe that the film has already done its job: not only did it entertain those who saw it and continue to see it, but it also had a certain social role in the way it awakened in younger people (but not only them) a certain awareness of ecology, for the preservation of endangered animals and species. I also believe that the film had a certain responsibility for changing the thinking of zoos and places that keep animals in captivity: instead of being ""animal deposits"" for public entertainment, they became institutions with ever greater relevance in the preservation of animals: today, they are essential for the survival of species whose natural habitats have been destroyed and which are only perpetuated in captivity. They also take the lead in the assisted reproduction of many animals, such as the Giant Panda Bear, for example, as well as in the rescue, veterinary treatment and preparation of animals that, having been illegally hunted or lived many years in human company, need to return to wildness.

Thus, this film turns out to be more relevant for the effect it had on people than by itself. Analyzing it in a simple way, it is a rather sugary film, loaded with clich√©s and without great artistic quality. A family entertainment film, excellent to watch with the kids and which, for years, was almost institutional on television during the Christmas season. The script is quite simple, and takes a rebellious and angry teenager to regenerate when he begins to have contact with an orca that has lived in captivity for years. The friendship between them is touching and sincere, as well as the boy's efforts, and the friends he makes, to release her to the seas, in a race against time and against the action of the villains, the owners of the park where she is kept, and who don't care about her at all. It is an extremely predictable film, which excessively romanticizes the release of animals kept in captivity, making the public forget that a whole previous preparation is necessary, taking several years, and that we never know if the animal, after years depending on humans, is it really going to adapt. Keiko, the orca that the movie used (and who lived in captivity for years after the movie), would eventually be prepared and released to the sea, but as we know, she never adapted to the wild.

The film has a good cast, but a terrible conception of characters. None of the characters are really good and all are clich√©s: the heroic teenager, the Native American full of ancestral wisdom who knows animals like no one else, the arrogant capitalists with no respect for anything or anyone... Excluding the orca Keiko, it's Jason James Ritcher who will stand out as an actor, in the role of the teenager who saves the day. He does what it takes, and I think he was relatively credible in his effort. Michael Madsen also deserves praise for his work, in a film that, incidentally, will be one of the most popular of his artistic career. Lori Petty and Jayne Atkinson are pretty good, August Schellenberg does what he can with the clich√© given to him. The rest simply doesn't matter.

Technically, the film stands out for its good cinematography. A lot of '90s movies seem ancient when we see them now, but this is one of those laudable exceptions that deserves to be mentioned. The filming locations, as well as the sets, also deserve a positive note for their visual beauty. The sound effects are very good, and the visual and special effects deserve praise, in particular the animatronic whale, which is quite realistic. Finally, a note to praise the quality of the main theme of the soundtrack created for this film, which is one of the most beautiful of its time."
Hot Shots! Part Deux (1993),"Writer/director Jim Abrahams spoofs Rambo (as well as Terminator 2, Basic Instinct, Star Wars and The Wizard of Oz), with Charlie Sheen returning as heroic Topper Harley, who leads a team of soldiers to Iraq on a mission to rescue hostages taken during Desert Storm (and to free the men who were sent to rescue the men who were sent to rescue the hostages).

It's funny how your tastes change over the years: back in 1993, I thought that Hot Shots Part Deux was unrelentingly hilarious; this time around, the film had me giggling a few times, but the majority of the jokes seemed incredibly lame and puerile. I guess I'm more sophisticated than I give myself credit for.

Sheen is passable as a comic actor, Valeria Golino is ravishing as love interest Ramada, and Richard Crenna mercilessly mocks his Col. Trautman role in the Rambo movies. But it's 'Tug' Benson, the incompetent President of the USA, who made me chuckle the most. Surely no-one that inept and boorish could possibly be elected to the post of Commander in Chief (looks at today's news and rolls his eyes)."
"Hudsucker Proxy, The (1994)","After Waring Hudsucker, the head of Hudsucker Industries unexpectedly and inexplicably commits suicide. The scheming head of his board of directors, Sidney Musberger plots to cash in on his former boss's demise by appointing a moron to run the company. When the stock falls low enough, Musberger and his equally conniving board members can then buy the stock and restore the company's profits. The unprincipled head executive chooses Norvile Barnes who has only just been employed in the mail room. Clumsy and credulous, he appears to be the likely choice. However, feisty reporter Amy Archer is suspicious of the board's choice of the new head of Hudsucker Industries and strives to uncover their nefarious motives.

Revisiting the same kind of off-the-wall comedy that they collaborated on with Sam Raimi in Crimewave, The Hudsucker Proxy, with which Raimi would share a screenwriting credit, with both, owed much to the 1950s Hollywood screwball comedies of Howard Hawks and Frank Capra. With a further dose of inspiration coming from the animated shorts of Tex Avery. It's a simple premise that sees Tim Robbin's wide-eyed, naive Norvile Barnes arriving in New York to seek his fortune. Taking a job in the mailroom before coming to the attention of Paul Newman's slimy Sidney Musberger who seeks to exploit Barne's oblivious nature. Smelling a Rat of course is the dedicated news reporter, with Jennifer Janson Leigh's Amy Archer going undercover, and becoming the unsuspecting Noville's secretary. Yes, you are pretty much on somewhat familiar ground here, with the inevitable romantic subplot on the cards. Predictable though it may be the Coen's compensate for this with some superb stylistic touches.

From the cavernous, depths of the Mailroom, to the gleaming, marbled interiors of the executive offices, The Brother's Coen seemingly creates a world in of itself. Taking their cues from Terry Gilliam's Brazil. It's as grand and elaborate as its goofy, off-the-wall set pieces. From Charles Durning's suicidal Waring Hudsucker (the late Charles Durning) taking a swan-dive from the top floor of his overly towering skyscraper to neatly pastiching the treacly 1950s newsreels of yesteryear. They also brilliantly in a matter of minutes chronicle the growing hula-hoop craze.

The entire cast clearly seemed to be enjoying themselves here, with Robbins throwing himself into his role with considerable enthusiasm. As does Leigh who sublimely channels Katherine Hepburn, while Newman is suitably conniving and aloof, as Musbrger who is nothing more than a figurative snake-oil salesman and huckster. The movie is also well served by its wacky, offbeat characters from a fast-talking elevator operator named Buzz to Amy's crusty Editor and Chief, played by the late John Mahoney of Frasier fame. Not forgetting Sam Raimi regular, and B-movie icon Bruce Campbell as a sleazy, slick fellow journalist, Smitty. Topping them off is Moses, the time-keeper who maintains Hudsucker Industries clock tower, and not only serves as the movie's narrator but who offers some pearls of wisdom and seems to know more than a man in his lowly menial position should. And who in one of the movie's more surreal flights of fantasy freezes time, and partially plays a part in influencing the outcome of the plot.

Indeed, the Coens do let the frenetic pacing get ahead of itself at times, and its kookiness on occasion doesn't quite hit the mark, but there's still some inspired inventiveness. As well as visual and comical panache that offsets it. For whatever shortcomings it has, The Hudsucker Proxy is a charming, goofball comedy bolstered by top performances from a first-rate cast and, rights the wrongs that the filmmaking siblings made with Crimewave."
Jurassic Park (1993),"We knew going into this there would be little to kindle the intellect -- Spielberg is only interested in stories that can be explained in comic book panels...

There's not much cinematic originality either, CGI notwithstanding. The primary visual element here is 'the hand' -- Spielberg's mainstay.

Everything is told through borrowings from other movies, mainly ""King Kong"" (from the first remake in '76), ""Jaws"" (the raptor pen), ""Aliens""(the kitchen evasion and the dropped ceiling escape). Heck, even ""Crocodile Dundee"" makes an appearance.

So back to the intellect - Spielberg's in way over his head when he attempts to explicate chaos theory; Crichton's parallel novel is better for this, if that interests you.

Essentially, all complex systems must eventually behave unpredictably. The thing is, Spielberg never attempts anything complex, and never lets anything out of the control of the guiding hand...he just tries to purport the illusion of complexity: the flea circus writ large.

The entire movie is mirrored by the tour's animated DNA cartoon -- all of the content is meant for the consumption of mental ten year olds.

Malcolm is presented with the proper cerebral depth in the novel; Goldblum knows this is a joke, so he plays this as the comic relief. He's the only real fun here."
Much Ado About Nothing (1993),"Having seen this film when it was released and having disliked it at the time, then watched it again recently, disliked it even more.

The worst defect is the overacting. Emma Thompson is perfectly dreadful as she overdoes it in every scene she has; but the rest of the cast also overact, their facial expressions animated like some cartoon. They all mug to camera except Washington but his part is semi-regal. The less said about Michael Keaton's performance the better - it is comically rank. His accent is a bogus Irish stevedore stuck in Tuscany.

The other annoying feature is the glued on grins and smiles as if this is a Carry On film. If only Sid James had appeared to add some class. And finally the music is a sticky overbearing aural goop that lacks nuance. Film music and Shakespeare are not good companions and in this case, to quote, 'The Tempest', ""misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows.""

The play is one of Shakespeare's very best. It is the very first romantic comedy with ill-matched lovers who find love, but none of that brilliant sparring battle between Benedick and Beatrice is here."
Robert A. Heinlein's The Puppet Masters (1994),"How the producers got away with calling this ""Robert A. Heinlein's Puppet Masters"" amazes me - because the only resemblance to Heinlein's genuinely chilling short story about Titan 'slugs' are the character names. That's it. None of the wonderfully satirical espionage group shenanigans, none of the gripping suspense, none of the character development, and none of the setting. ""Puppet Masters"" is not supposed to be set in 1994, it's supposed to be set in 1957 - but a different 1957 to the one we know. I mean, this film didn't even attempt the flying cars or the hand-held lasers. Like so many new sci-fi films made from older literature classics, the fiction has been cut out like some sort of hideous tumor and the science has been exaggerated to make sure the audience knows it's SCIENCE fiction. The fact that the science is largely irrelevant is lost on most modern screen writers - and this movie is no exception.

Another example of a perfectly good story that has been shredded to make it 'fit' Hollywood's version of science-fiction, which is largely made up of clanking robots, flashing lights and explosions.

""The Faculty"" was a good SF movie. And it was right - Body Snatchers is a rip-off from this story, but it never pretended to be anything but. Faculty had some enjoyable sequences. It wasn't perfect, and elements were laughable, but despite this, it was true to itself..._this_ film was just the massacre of a perfectly good story.

I only hope anyone else who ever tries to make a movie of a Heinlein classic will stick to the book and make a decent movie, not rehash the story until it sounds good - because they sounded good before."
"Ref, The (1994)","Far from typical Christmas fare, comedy or otherwise The Ref is an under rated classic that is a perfect blend of cynicism and hope, cleverness and bawdy comedy. It has a lot of shrill moments and if foul language makes you uneasy stay away but most will find the obscenities just part of the plot as the resolution of anger and bitterness in the lives of four people is what this film is about.

A sort of ""Ransom for Redchief"" style plot where a very sophisticated cat burglar takes a dysfunctional family hostage on Christmas eve much to his initial regret, this film succeeds in the main on the terrific acting by most of the cast. So much of the comedy is carried through because of small facial expressions, minute actions and razor sharp timing from the participants. The leads are priceless, Judy Davis in particular, although one finds himself quoting the two male leads perhaps more often. Christine Baranski, Glynnis Johns and Adam Le Ferve reveal their absolute mastery of the character actors craft with excellent support that shines in its own right. Phillip Nichol and Ellie Raab as the young nephew and niece provide the perfect foil of innocence for all of the ""adultness"". A great movie to watch as a relief from the typical nostalgic and kid orientated Christmas flicks. There are so many really good Christmas stories and this one numbers among them aimed squarely at grown-ups for a change.

Although Ted Demme changed the ending and is said to have regretted doing so I think it was the right decision adding one last lurch of suspense to the overall mix the first watch around. What happens?-sorry you'll have to wait to open this present yourself."
"Remains of the Day, The (1993)","This is the Quintessential period piece! The flow of it is so seamless, that like classical music or a beautiful piece of art - you never tire of it. It marks the end of the expansion of prosperity, change and invention of the Victorian and Edwardian eras, that for the first time in history, brought into existence a large, educated middle class. It is the span of this society and it's events that were both passed on to us as a nation, and have had a greater influence on our modern day than any other period. As they were the beginning of the modern era. By the 1930's we come to the end of the rigid class system that had evolved during these periods. This story is in fact all about the servants and is seen from their perspective. Regular working class people, their lives and loves - they are it's real champions. I believe it to be the finest film ever made on the subject, and one of the finest films period.

Easy on both the eyes and the mind, it is effortless to watch. And one of only 3 films that I find myself returning to over and over again, more than any others. Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson who have so many great performances, do their best work here. Here in cinema is a display of excellence in the ordinary, and a celebration of both understatement, and unrequited love. We are only observers here in the sense that there is nothing to figure out, and what we observe is the perfect Servant. One who applies himself wholeheartedly to his craft, and finds contentment in doing his job well. A rarity in both life and cinema. I find it very telling that perhaps the finest English film was a collaboration of men from two former colonies - India and the U.S., a Japanese author, a Celt in the male lead, and a screenwriter from Germany married to an Indian, who has spent most of her life in India and America. These are the people that school us in the culture that birthed our own, and so much of modern western civilization. None of them are English.

The perfect fit that I think James Ivory often reaches for is achieved here. It is a movie without sex, violence, or bad language, which are often added from a lack of strength, not as proof of it. This movie is a tribute to everything good that is England. Merchant and Ivory couldn't have done better.

Searching for Bobby Fischer (1993),"As the father of a child talented at chess (state champion), I really enjoyed watching SFBF. Great story, and great acting by Max Pomeranc.

So naturally, I wanted to learn more about Josh Waitzkin, and much to my disappointment I found that the ending was a complete lie. Yes, Josh did play for the US championship. But in reality Josh didn't win. When Josh was 9 years old, he had a draw against a 7-year old named Jeff Sarwer. And an analysis of the game shows that Jeff was clearly winning, but a mistake cost him, ending the game in a draw.

Jeff Sarwer is an interesting story. In real life, Pandolfini said that he had never met anyone else with such a raw talent for the game. But unlike Josh who grew up in a comfortable surroundings, Jeff really did play speed chess with the drug addicts. His father was considered abusive, and Jeff and his equally talented sister Julia were taken away from his father by protective services. But the kids ran away from a foster home, back to their father, and Jeff didn't play chess again for almost 20 years. And when he did, he beat a number of grandmasters despite having no apparent practice.

So far we know that the ending was a lie (thanks to the Internet making these games from 1985 available), and that Jeff played with the drug addicts. So what is really true?

My unfortunate conclusion is that Josh's dad saw that while his child was talented, he was nowhere close to Jeff Sarwer (by the way, Josh never made GrandMaster). But with Sarwer out of the way, why not make his son look good, and make Jeff look bad. What a travesty!"
Sleepless in Seattle (1993),"This is a movie with characters and performances which are appealing, and it is an old-fashioned, feel-good love story. The film also has a bit of sadness in its early part, thankfully not overdone. The five lead characters and the performances by their actors (Hanks, Ryan, Malinger, Pullman and O'Donnell) are all engaging.

The primary members of the support cast are also excellent (David Pierce, Annie's brother; Garber and Wilson as Sam's brother-in-law and sister; Reiner as his colleague/friend; young Gaby Hoffman; and Barbara Garrick as Sam's brief girlfriend).

The story, juxtaposed with the classic Grant/Kerr predecessor, could have provided an excessive gimmick, but here it worked well. And I was grateful for some things I didn't find in this flick. Although I watched the program like everyone else, I found Rob Reiner's character, acting and presence in ""All in the Family"" to be obnoxious and annoying, ALL THE TIME, and watched the program in spite of his presence. And I have found Rosie O'Donnell's presence to be the epitom√© of ANNOYING in every respect, every time I've observed her, previously. But in this film, I enjoyed both of their performances completely. Children in movies can also be an irritating presence, but Malinger and Hoffman were delightful as son Jonah, and his little neighbor/friend. Barbara Garrick, with a supporting role here (as in ""The Firm"") is an appealing actress, for whom one would wish more prominent roles.

Tom Hanks is one of the foremost actors of our time, but even he can go a smidgen too far in a characterization (I thought he did so in both ""Forrest Gump"" and ""Philadelphia""). But he certainly didn't here. Watch, enjoy, and feel good."
"Nightmare Before Christmas, The (1993)","The Nightmare Before Christmas follows Jack Skellington, a skeleton leading Halloween town who, after having another successful Hallowe'en, discovers Christmas and becomes obsessed with introducing the holiday into his world.

The visuals are, to be expected, great. It's a creepy Tim Burton clay-mation movie, what do you expect? The way in which it is done screams the 90s, but despite it's age it holds up very well regardless.

The soundtrack is a lot of fun, specifically the opening song. The rest of the songs are worked into the movie very well, and I never dreaded listening to any of them when they did come up. Furthermore, they actually contributed to the story in most cases, so I had to listen anyway

However, without the visuals this would be a very poor movie. The writing is unnatural a lot of the time, and it features an incredibly forced, out-of-nowhere ending scene. On top of that, there are several points throughout the movie where certain events happen for no reason. Jack and other characters know things they never had the opportunity to learn. Sure, we as the audience can piece together that they went to some other character and figured it out, but because that is never shown and it is somewhat important that they do because of how it will affect the story, I have to assume that they didn't happen and that the writers just didn't know what to do because they were running out of time.

Despite this, I more or less enjoyed the movie. I wouldn't say it's good, but it's worth a watch. I'll probably never see it again, and in the end I wouldn't really recommend it."
True Romance (1993),"True Romance is obscure film. Film was unfortunate to come at the time in which huge blockbusters and award winning film were slowly coming to screen, there of it was forgotten. All people to who I recommended this film never heard about it, and when they saw it, they only have one word: SUPERB! Tarantino who decided to split Natural born killers and True Romance scripts (which ere basically same script ) made terrifying job at it, but real star behind film is late Tony Scott. Without a doubt, this is best film Scott has ever made, and that can be seen in whole film, from cast to score and even ending which is best thing that Scott decided to do, despite Tarantino's wishes, but even Tarantino himself was pleased at the end of it. Scott gave himself into the film and created cult masterpiece that will never be forgotten. Cast is terrifying. Cristian Slater before he become second rate actor and Patricia Arquete had believable chemistry on screen which made whole film. Supporting cast including Gary Oldman ( In his best role ever put to screen), Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini, Denis Hopper not to mention others, made beautiful ensemble cast which was not very well known at the time, but today, they are all first class actors. I could write about this film for hours, but in the end I can only say that watch this film and enjoy one of best films ever made. Live fast, die young, be a ice looking corpse!"
Welcome to the Dollhouse (1995),"Dawn Wiener (Heather Matarazzo) is the awkward middle child and social outcast 7th grader. She's got the hated nickname Wienerdog. Girls call her lesbo. Not even the other outcasts like her. The teachers find her annoying. Her parents ignore her. Her mother favors the youngest adorable Missy. Her older brother Mark is a nerd but he's a driven nerd. He gets the popular hunk Steve Rodgers to join his band and she's completely infatuated. Everybody picks on her especially class bully Brandon. She has the Special People Club in the backyard with her only friend the younger Ralphy. Steve Rodgers is actually nice to her and she misunderstands. Brandon starts taking an even more intense interest in her.

Heather Matarazzo is amazingly awkward. It is cringe-worthy. Writer/director Todd Solondz is the king of the disturbing underbelly of society. The bullying is hard to watch. Dawn is not a nice girl but she is the clueless girl trying to find her way. She often hurts people just as others have hurt her. The movie is so uncomfortable that the audience has no choice but to laugh. And then it gets darker. Sometimes it goes over the edge like what happens to Missy. There's no real need to go that far but it's not a problem. At its center, there is the compelling Matarazzo."
Home Alone (1990),"This film was definitely loved when it came out, and now it's seen as a Christmas classic. Do I agree with that? Well, yes, in different ways then others see it. I saw this recently after many years of not seeing it with a more critical mindset. It's a decent movie, but it's not great. You see, when I say it's a ""Christmas classic"" I don't mean it's a great movie. My reason for my usage of the term ""Christmas classic"" is because there aren't many great Christmas movies out there. Besides Elf, and Christmas Story, there aren't a lot of great Christmas movies.

It certainly is a good movie to watch around Christmas, but it does have its flaws and problems. Macaulay Culkin is pretty good in this movie, as well as Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, but the rest of the actors aren't too good. The story has a lot of flaws. First of all, why doesn't Kevin go to a friends' house? Surely not everyone he knows has gone to Paris or something. He lives in a suburban neighbourhood in Chicago with a BUNCH of people, and he can't go to a friends' house? All these flaws I can kinda look past, but I can't pretend they're not there. This film is good, but not great."
Aladdin (1992),"Aladdin is one of the many Disney Classics. Like the others, Aladdin has songs, detailed animation, and a good versus evil setting. It is pretty predictable, and has a main character who usually falls in love with some pretty girl.

One of Aladdins many strong points was the talented voice acting of Robin Williams. The ability to portray so many different and silly characters that the genie does is one of the best parts in the movie. It is similar to how Eddie Murphy got to play Mushu in Mulan.

Something else remarkable about this film was the storyline. The storyline starts off with Jafar (the villain) trying to find the Magic Lamp which will give him three wishes. Jafar finds the Cave of Wonders, in which the lamp is hidden. However, the cave won't let just anybody in. The only person who can enter the cave is a ""street rat"" named Aladdin. Meanwhile, Aladdin is stealing a loaf of bread and running away from the guards. Of course, this means a song would be involved. So, while singing a-long with the guards, Aladdin is stealing a loaf of bread because he has no money. Another plot that is happening at this time, is Jasmine's story. Jasmine has to marry a prince, but doesn't seem to like any of the ones her father picked out for her. The three character's quests and stories later merge together to make the main storyline.

However, in the storyline there is one small flaw. How come Aladdin is the only person who can enter the Cave of Wonders? That's what I have been wondering. Is it just to make a storyline?

Anyways, ignoring that detail, I wanted to say that it seems like Aladdin has a little something for everyone. It has action for the little boys. Girls may like the romance. Little children will probably like the singing and the fact that it's a cartoon. Finally, dads will probably enjoy the fact that Robin Williams is doing the voice acting in this film. (My dad does anyways, and requested to put that in there.) See it.

6.5/10

Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937),"Quite simply, this one reigns supreme. Although much of the praise this film receives, may be due to the fact that it was it's creator's first attempt at an animated feature, I think it's obvious merits and artistic triumphs are enough to maintain it's place at the top.

First, there is the artwork, which is stunning. The color isn't at it's most vibrant, such as with, say, ""Cinderella"" (1950), but it is suitable and lovely all the same. A virtual watercolor painting come to life. The details in the animation never fail to amaze. Just look at the raindrops in the chase sequence towards the end. Look how they hit the rocks, and slip away. Such attention to detail was rarely matched in an animated feature, except maybe, in ""Pinocchio"" (1940).

The characters are of various degrees of interest, with Snow White, probably the least of these. The dwarfs are all charming, and it is they who carry the film during their screentime with the princess. However, one should not deny, that the true star of this film, is the evil queen. Both in her presence of glamour, and in her transformation as an old crone, she is fascinating to watch. I don't believe another Disney villian has ever been both frightening and enchanting, like she has.

Lastly, the music in this film is truly memorable. The ""Heigh Ho"" sequence is visually impressive, and the dwarfs song as they bathe is a great comedy bit. Not to mention Snow White's anthem ""Someday My Prince Will Come""; another gem in the Disney library.

All in all, a tremendous production. Beautiful, thrilling, and memorable."
Fargo (1996),"Joel Coen the director of ""Fargo"", proves he is one of our best directors with this tale of deception and murder told in a style that takes humorous turns in the action. ""Fargo"" is one of the best American films of the nineties. Joel Coen working together with his brother, Ethan, have made pictures that will be viewed as classics, as time will tell. Their movies are always an excellent way to spend some time because they always manage to deliver, even in films that aren't popular with the public.

A lot of what makes this film work is the amazing casting feat the Coen brothers achieved in giving Frances McDormand and William H. Macy, two of our best film actors, prominent presence in it. The Marge Gunderson of Ms. McDormand is one of the best creations the Coen brothers have produced. The same can be said of William H. Macy's take on the pathetic Jerry Lundergaard, the idiotic man who sets things in motion in the film. Ms. McDormand and Mr. Macy have only one scene together, yet one wouldn't even think about other actors playing these roles.

The supporting cast of ""Fargo"" is a joy to watch. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare make two of the most enjoyable bad guys in memory. These two scum bags are a joke. Anyone in his right mind wouldn't entrust either Carl or Gaer for a hit job. John Carroll Lynch plays Norm, the stoic man who is married to Marge. Harve Presnell is good as Wade Gustafson.

The atmosphere created by the Coens work well. We are constantly reminded of the deep winter seasons of the area where the action takes place. They have given their characters a local flavor and even to hear them talk would take us to that region of the country.

""Fargo"" is a joy to watch thanks to Joel and Ethan Coen."
Heavy Metal (1981),"...and I'm damned glad I did.

I slapped on headphones and put the DVD in the Macbook and set sail for a better time's stony realms...I read comments saying ""If only this movie were made now, it would be so much better, blah blah blah,"" and that's the biggest crock of horsesh*t I've ever heard. If it were made now, it would be slicker than slick, void of soul, with the wretched music of our age providing the soundtrack. Heavy Metal circa 1981 has the texture and imperfect beauty that sustaining, lasting art must possess; think Miles Davis' Bi*ches Brew or Sketches of Spain, or the Rolling Stones' Exile on Main Street - that's where Heavy Metal lives. It's not perfect, parts of it are quite flawed, but as a whole, even the flaws are beautiful gems to behold, and I tell you, for every voice barking on about Heavy Metal's flaws being too much to take, I say this: you take your Saw and remakes of Texas Chainsaw and The Omen and whatever else your fetid college brains latch onto as broken things that need fixing, and we'll take Heavy Metal and the original versions of the horror movies mentioned and be artistically far richer. But you're not after richness in art, are you? You're after eye-candy and digitally rendered starscapes, aren't you? Yes, you are. And you're beggars with moldy bread because of it.

Heavy Metal is a classic, and I'll be first to admit that it's got problems, but believe it or not, problems sometimes add to a classic's being considered a classic in the first place. Exhibit A: Heavy Metal. Watch, listen and learn, youngsters."
"Aristocats, The (1970)","This Disney animation is set in early twentieth century France where a wealthy Parisian woman who has decided that her cat, Duchess, along with her three kittens, Berlioz, Marie and Toulouse will inherit her wealth. They are to be looked after by butler Edgar and he will inherit when they are gone... but when he overhears this he decides he can't wait so slips sleeping pills into the cats' food and drives them far into the country. When they awaken they have no idea where they are but passing alley cat, Thomas O'Malley, offers to help them return to Paris. Along the way home they get into a number of scrapes as well as meeting a pair of helpful geese and O'Malley's friend Scat Cat and his jazz playing associates. While this is going on the cats' friend Roquefort, a mouse, and Frou-Frou the horse learn what happened and Edgar realises he has left potentially incriminating evidence in the countryside.

I wasn't sure what to expect from this film but since Disney rarely disappoints I decided to give it a go. I'm glad that I did as it was a lot of fun. The story provided plenty of laughs cute characters, excitement that shouldn't be too scary for younger viewers, a touch of romance and a villain who is more comical than fearsome. The story moves at a good pace and at just under eighty minutes doesn't overstay its welcome. There are a few songs of which he jazz number 'Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat' was easily the most entertaining. There are plenty of amusing moments; my favourites involve Edgar and two hounds he has trouble with in the countryside. The animation is really good with beautifully detailed backgrounds and fine character designs. The voice cast do an impressive job of bringing the characters to life. Overall I'd say this is well worth watching for fans of Disney or of animated films in general."
All Dogs Go to Heaven 2 (1996),"First off, I have to say, I get very irritated when people bad mouth a movie just because it happens to be a sequel. As in it's doomed to fail from the start. This couldn't be more wrong. Fievel 2 and 3 were better than 1, Terminator 2 was better than the first, and in this case, All Dogs 2 is far superior to All Dogs 1.

The first thing I love about this movie is the music. ""I will always be with you"" And ""It's too heavenly"" are some of my favorite songs from any musical ever. The songs are there just enough to be a great accompaniment without being too intrusive. And on top of that, they're good.

When it comes to Don Bluth films, he always has this incredibly dark, gritty tone for the film, and with ADGTH 1, it really made it unenjoyable. It was dark, depressing, and it wasn't for me. I could see why other people might enjoy it, but I was not on board with the feeling or the style. The sequel has far brighter colors and leaves you feeling with more of a happy feeling, which I enjoy far more than being depressed.

I loved the voice cast with them bringing back Dom and introducing Charlie Sheen as Charlie Barkin. I think this casting was great for Charlie. I think the addition of Bebe Neuwirth and Sheena Easton for Annabelle and Sasha were spot on, and I didn't even mind the kid actor as David. I think he was a realistic fun character and I normally don't say that about children characters.

People criticize this film for being peppier and losing the ""idea"" behind the original. In my humble opinion, it was improved with this film. I loved the comedy, the message, the music, and everything about it. It is my favorite sequel ever and in my mind far superior than the original. There are some animation goofs here and there, but it doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment of the film.

When it is all said and done, it is in my top five favorite movies. And i've seen a LOT of movies so that's an accomplishment. If you enjoy happy movies that leave you with a good feeling, regardless of whether it's a sequel or not, I would say give it a watch. It deserves a lot more accolades than it gets.

9.5/10. Since I can't give it a 1/2, i'll round it up to a 10. It deserves it."
Theodore Rex (1995),"I saw this only today, and I do agree with the other reviews, it really is that bad. So much so, I am seriously considering putting it on my bottom 20. Before I begin criticising this abominable film, I have to give some credit to Whoopi Goldberg for trying so hard to give her character some credibility if not entirely succeeding for understandable reasons.

The special effects are just woeful, very rushed and lacking any clarity or sharpness. Theodore Rex as a character looks grotesque and horrible as well, and cinematography and editing-wise the film looks cheap. The story is woefully predictable and misconceived, the dialogue is sloppy with any sense of comedy being flushed down the toilet and the direction is wretched. Also, Theodore Rex is too violent for kids and adults I agree will find it a chore to watch due to its own stupidity.

The acting is also dire. Goldberg tries hard, but Armin Muellen-Stahl overdoes it badly in a very clich√©d role as a mad scientist and lacks any menace. Overall, a really bad movie that as far as I'm concerned deserves its dubious reputation. 1/10 Bethany Cox"
Sgt. Bilko (1996),"Directed by Jonathan Lynn. Starring Steve Martin, Phil Hartman, Dan Aykroyd, Glenne Headly, Daryl Mitchell, Austin Pendleton, John Marshall Jones, Pamela Adlon, Max Casella, Eric Edwards, Brian Leckner, Chris Rock, Cathy Silvers, Richard Herd. (PG)

The lovable army base grifter from ""The Phil Silvers Show"" is given a 1990s revamp, now played by Steve Martin; no character assassination here, as Martin forgoes mimicry and plays it in a fashion suited to his devilishly charming ways (they share a character name and a few traits, but that's about it). SNL alums Aykroyd and Hartman have their moments, but their talents are often under-utilized; Martin, however, is an energetically slippery force to be reckoned with (he already played an eccentric scam artist in ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,"" so this is old hat for him), milking laughs that wouldn't be there for almost any other comic actor. Rarely a comedy riot, and most of the satirical jabs it takes at ineffective military brass are soft and obvious, but the movie is peppered with enough guffaws to hold one's interest throughout. A lot of the most inspired bits are actually tossed off haphazardly by Martin's quick silver-tongue, requiring more attention from the audience than usual for an ""amiably amusing"" comedy of modest rewards. Phil Silvers' daughter, Cathy, plays one of the officers investigating Bilko's shenanigans.

Diabolique (1996),"Occasionally only, I should make clear. So bloody awful that not for the first time do I wish there was a minus rating on IMDb. Picked this up in a remainder bin for a couple of dollars and figured I had loved the French original from the fifties so how bad could the remake be? Might be a curiosity item and the cast was pretty stellar - for one the magnificent and rarely misplaced Kathy Bates was in it.

Was I in for a shock. Nothing, absolutely nothing, worked in this movie. The plot, the minescule amount that was there of it, was drivel. There was no character development AT ALL.

Some awful special effects (get those white eyes on the corpse, folks)and a supposedly creepy atmosphere that makes one chortle every time the usually lovely Isabelle gapes in a mirror at herself. Doesn't everyone look in a mirror when they're frightened? I know it's the first thing I think of, as I climb out of bed after a nightmare - I look in a mirror to make myself feel better.

More threads going nowhere than you could count in a ragged old sweater. The lesbian sub-plot that never quite makes it. And it should. It is a key element in this woeful adaptation. Sharon Stone mincing around in an oddly wired looking walk with trampy tight clothes and really high heels and the strangest lipstick that doesn't leave a mark on her frequently lit cigarettes (she's a school teacher in a private school, Catholic, yeah that's believable). And on and on. How does one get funding for such a travesty, thirty million dollars, I believe??? And the overacting of Chazz and Isabelle... I could write a book on that alone. There should be a law against this kind of thing. 1 out of 10 for what I don't know, only that there isn't a zero rating on IMDb. And as I said, we need these movies, just to make us appreciate even the mediocre ones."
Moll Flanders (1996),"Defoe's original novel, even after all these years, is funny, sad, entertaining and fast-moving. The film is basically only sad, with little resemblance to the novel. It is also dreadfully slow in parts. Some of the acting is good- Stockard Channing makes an excellent Madam, and Aisling Corcoran as the little girl is splendid, producing the few flashes of humour, and there are some very nice cameo parts from well-known British and Irish actors. However, Morgan Freeman (normally a very good actor) seems to have a rather variable accent and to be wondering how he got into this film (not quite Dick van Dyke in Mary Poppins, but...), and Robin Wright doesn't really convince me as a lower-class London girl. The costumes and settings give a good impression of what must have been a much less colourful world- particularly effective are the candle-lit indoor scenes. We get an interesting glimpse of the life and customs of late 17th-century/early 18th century England. However, there are some strange anachronisms- for instance, according to the novel, Moll was born in about 1614, but the clients at Mrs Allworthy's house seem to pay with bank-notes, which would have been extremely unusual at that time. Also I doubt that any little girl (even a feisty one like this) brought up in a Catholic orphanage would have used such strong language. This is nit-picking, I know, and it's only a film, but it's a pity that, with a bit more attention to the story-line and the script, the film could have been so much better."
Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy (1996),"First of all, the Kids in the Hall should rule the world. Honestly, they should. (Along with Will Ferrell.) If you are a fan, you don't even have an option, seeing it is a must. And who else but a fan would recognize Sid and Sharisse, and the Bigot Cabbie? This is a film only truly appriciated if you love little Bruce, and have a healthy respect for Mark's amazing command of fake accents. And if you can't stop staring at Kevin's hair, because it never ceases to amaze.

Besides... they're Canadian. Who doesn't like Canadians?

The short version: if you watch this, you will laugh. If you're a fan of KITH, you will laugh even harder. I can't get ""Happiness Pie"" out of my head, and you won't be able to either, because it's an ingenious song, (and no, I'm not high.)

Bruce is short and moody. We all love Bruce. Mark can make funny faces. We all love Mark. Kevin does that little high-pitched squealing thing. We all love Kevin. Dave is obviously addicted to caffiene and other mood-altering chemicals. We all love Dave. And Scott is very, very gay. So, of course, we love Scott.

It all just works out.

SO, SEE IT! It will feel like it's 72 degrees in your head, all day long."
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie (1996),"Do you find a really bad movie more amusing than annoying? Have you ever watched a lousy flick with friends and improvised dialogue for the actors or make remarks in jest about how stupid the film is? Have you ever wondered what happens to the other sock? If you answered yes, you will enjoy ""Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie"".

The premise is that the evil Dr. Forrester is subjecting Mike Nelson and his robot companions Tom Servo and Crow to some of the worst films of all time, as part of a plot to beat the world into submission. Yeah, this premise is pretty weak in itself, but the commentary from these three is what you'll be hooked by.

What this intrepid trio does best is make fun of stinky celluloid for the audience's amusement. They do the unimaginable; they make an utter piece of trash not only watchable, but hilarious. It's open season on ridiculous movies, and the film is merely a showcase of their regular television program of the same name. The film has been my first exposure to the show, which has selected episodes available on tape. Sadly, the show is not broadcast in my area, and sadder still is the news that the series will conclude this year. The unfortunate aspect of this is that I do have a sense of what I'm missing. It's a great concept, and has proven to be popular with many viewers.

The film for the mocking is ""This Island Earth"". A particularly cheesy selection that can actually be found on DVD in its original format without the hilarious commentary. Some people regard it as a sci-fi classic, but it's essentially been brought to better light with the help of the MST3K team. No one is safe. They even mock their own credits. Watch this one with friends if you can; it's really well done."
"Truth About Cats & Dogs, The (1996)","Janeane Garofalo has been very public in her displeasure about this film, calling it, among other things, anti-feminist. She has also said on her radio show she hates making ""romantic comedies"" because she doesn't believe in them. I wholeheartedly agree with Janeane here. This film is a trifle at best. She does her best, but overall, it was just another boring, unbelievable ""romantic comedy"" that has no basis in the real world. Whereas there will be some who will say ""suspend your disbelief"", one grows tired of having to suspend it nearly every time you get a romantic film from Hollywood. Janeane's character, for some reason, is usually filmed in shadows and darkness, which makes her look unattractive, while Uma's character is filmed in lighter tones (which probably displeased Janeane and is probably one of the reasons she detests this film). That really hurts the film if we are to buy the premise that Janeane is supposed to be the better looking of the two. As many have said here and on other comment threads, Janeane is not ugly, but in fact, quite beautiful. I haven't read one review where someone said Uma was better looking. Having said that though, I believe that Ben Chaplin's character would more than likely stay with Uma, not Janeane. Many men don't like really intelligent women (and many women don't like really intelligent men), and sadly, Ben probably would have stayed with Uma. And despite the director's attempt to make Janeane unattractive, it doesn't work. Her natural beauty comes through anyway.

I think a lot of Janeane's male fans who are obsessed with her like this film because they like to think of themselves in the Ben Chaplin character, and actually scoring with Janeane. Janeane is a lot more complicated than the character she plays here (real life is always much more complex than Hollywood can imagine), so take a cold shower gentlemen. This is the role that Janeane is best known for, and that's a shame, as this really isn't that good of a film."
Flipper (1996),"This film suffers from being caught between two thematic ideas; on the one hand it wants to be a light comic character romp, and on the other hand it tries for a contemporary teen romance come light adventure story. And on top of that, it tries to cash in on the reputation of the various TV series' versions of 'Flipper'. And the big problem is with this movie is that nothing really works; it all seems to cancel each other out.

(Spoiler Warning)

Paul Hogan is still quite adept at light knockabout comedy - such as the much-promoted toasting bread with a blowtorch bit - but this is mainly smothered by Elijah Wood's mod grunge moody contemporary teenager thang - which doesn't play to comedy very well.

There's a romantic angle thrown in with one of the local girls; but this is smothered by the attempt at character comedy with the showmanship entrepreneur angle, and the light adventure with the marauding shark bit.

Overall the film is too dull and downbeat to be really fun, and yet too light-hearted to really work as a serious contemporary story.

One bit I really liked however, was in the climactic scene when Elijah moved his eyes rapidly back and forth to show the character contemplating an emotional crunch-point. Elijah is naturally very expressive with his eyes, and he starts to show it off to good use in this movie. (PS: He's also got way hot legs as well - but that's totally beside the point!)"
"Horseman on the Roof, The  1995)","Finally a movie where wife uses a Brain instead of whats between in legs. i watched many ""wife affairs"" movies of 80s , 90s and after 2000 which most of them are really bad plot where wife SUDDENLY goes for adultery . this movie is in category of ""wife affairs"" in many famous websites.

Anyhow the movie story is good, solid performance by both lead characters , good quality production, good music.

A married woman is looking for husband during Epidemic and civil war or some kinda war i guess. then there is another dashing outlaw or outcast military guy who is fleeing and then both meet each other , later the guy fall in love or having feeling for that married woman and helps her all the way . even she doesnt FEEL him in start but later after the half of the movie she also developing some feelings for him until the end. But good things is there is no physical thing between them. as most movies, the wife usually drops panties."
"Rock, The (1996)","The Rock (1996) is a classic action film from Michael Bay and one of the best Nicholas Cage films ever! Con Air is his first favorite film of mine The Rock is his second favorite film of mine. I love this film to death and I can watch it over and over again! This is Nicholas Cage's best performance ever, I love his character FBI Special Agent Dr. Stanley Goodspeed who did saved over 1000 human lives in San Francisco while he raced against time to disarm the bombs! Seriously it is one of my favorite action films and Nicolas Cage's favorite film. This film has everything, it has solid cast, entertaining thrill, Die Hard in a prison a lot of action and it is not boring. The practical effects of the film are well done and are realistic, it has a lot of explosions, car chases and so on. There are no CGI in this film, mostly Nicholas Cage is more interesting in here than Sean Connery is.

""Welcome to the Rock.""

Plot: Nicolas Cage is Stanley Goodspeed, an FBI chemical weapons specialist who is brought into a hostage situation involving a crew of former US Marines, led by a rogue US Marine general (Ed Harris), who have taken over the former prison on Alcatraz Island and are threatening the city of San Francisco with a launch of missiles filled with deadly VX poison gas. Goodspeed finds himself going along on the mission to retake the prison with a squad of US Navy SEALS and John Mason (Sean Connery), a former SAS operative who has been imprisoned illegally for the past two decades, and the only man to have escaped the prison and can use his knowledge infiltrate ""The Rock"".

So that is basically the plot of the film. Stanley Goodspeed, an FBI chemical weapons specialist has to take on a group of Former US Marines who took over the prison Alcatraz with 80 tourists who took them as hostages and they are extortion their government for $100 million or they will launch the rockets on San Francisco. Everyone in this film does a great job. Sean Connery former James Bond, Indy's father from Indiana Jones and the last Crusade (1989) is brilliant in his performance as Captain John Patrick Mason, Special Air Service and Ed Harris as Brigadier General Francis X. ""Frank"" Hummel, USMC Force Recon is brilliant and great villain.

The script was great and the screen writers did a solid job and Michael Bay beside Bad Boys I and II did a really good solid job ever directing it! Con Air was the action film that really introduced me in to Nicolas Cage films so my beautiful mom bought me on my request Con Air, Face/Off and The Rock (1996) on VHS, which I still have all those films on tapes and I own them on Blu-ray and I still keep the old VHS tapes of those films. I love Con Air and The Rock but I hate Face/off which I think it is one of the worst boring lame action films from John Woo and Nicolas Cage ever! But Con Air and The Rock kicks ass I love these two films I love watching them. It is been 20 years anniversary since The Rock 1996 come out, it is my childhood film and I always cherish my childhood movies to death!

Things: I love about this film: Nicolas Cage's character was so caring and awesome, when on the island in prison General Francis X. Hummel's men kill all NAVY Seals team except John Patrick Mason and Stanley Goodspeed, Cage want's to disarme the bombs while Connery want's to get off the island, Cage want's to convince Connery to helps him, which he does on the end. The two fight each other against a team rogue former US Marines to stop them, by killing innocent people. General Francis X. Hummel is not a monster like he was showing in the beginning of the film, he only wanted that government pays the money to the family's for loosing their sons and fathers. I also love the scene in which Sean Connery throws a knife in to one of the marines guarding the rocket, and killing the other marine while firing a machine gun on him awesome!

Overall: I love this flick to death I am giving 10 out of 10 for one of my favorite Nicolas Cage action films.

Twister (1996),"You don't play with Mother Nature. That's common sense; anyone who does, well, I feel sorry for them. In ""Twister,"" Nature is given a frightening new dimension courtesy of breathtaking Hollywood CGI effects but it's dumbed down by a questionable script and dialogue (thanks to none other than novelist Michael Crichton himself as a co-author, along with wife Anne-Marie Martin) and sub-par acting. Sure, a number of liberties are also taken with tornadoes (""fingers of God"" - one character calls them), but what do you expect from a film directed by ""Speed"" Jan de Bont?

And lastly, who goes to see movies like this for scientific accuracy? I remember watching it with a friend and giving him a nasty tongue-lashing afterwards for his redundant pointing out of the various scientific and factual inaccuracies that abound in it (which he told me had each been identified by his science teacher - go figure). I snapped back, ""Dude, chill out. It's just a movie. Who cares if this does or doesn't happen, or tornadoes don't suck like that."" I basically told him to get a grip.

Nature is unrepentant in its desire to test human will to withstand her destructive forces. I showered praise on ""Twister"" for capturing that and making sure its human characters realize it. I make these statements because ""Twister"" is quite terrifying in its scenes of tornadoes blazing paths of destruction, and this is what people tend to miss when watching it. I know I'm sure to run into flak because of it but, what am I going to do {*shrugs shoulders*}?

As the film opens on the plains of Oklahoma's Tornado Alley, the National Weather Service is tracking several storm systems that if they were to merge any time soon, they could see a record outbreak of violent, tornado-producing severe weather. Next, we're introduced to meteorologist and recent divorc√©e Bill (Bill Paxton) and fianc√©e Melissa (Jami Gertz) - ""She's a reproductive therapist,"" he reassures us, after Bill is asked if she is HIS therapist. Melissa isn't too keen on the idea of storm chasing, which poses a problem for them both, but for Bill it was always the thrill of the hunt, and we know he's not going to pass the opportunity to get back in the mode of things.

We then arrive at a field where we meet the storm chasers, led by Bill's tough ex and fellow meteorologist Jo (Helen Hunt), who has somehow mysteriously forgotten to sign her name to the last page of the divorce papers (she still loves him). When asked if he's back by the various supporting players, he emphatically denies he has returned to his field of expertise. But it turns out, however, that before their marriage went to hell, they had been busy developing a revolutionary storm system-tracking device that could give them the inside knowledge of how tornadoes work.

""DOROTHY"" (real original), the miracle device, a package that contains hundreds of little sensors, could be placed in the damage path and each sensor could provide a detailed map of a tornado's inner-workings and with such knowledge now available, they could design an advanced warning system. The trick is, however, they have to wait until a twister spawns, place Dorothy in its damage path (or ""Suck Zone""), and then run like hell. The action begins when they're forced to take off to chase after the storm, and it's about here the film abandons logic and plot for nonstop special effects, peril, and destruction.

Saying the acting here sucks and is uninspired is like saying we went to see ""Jurassic Park"" (1993) for the performances - understatement - get real. It's easy for any casual movie-goer to pick apart bad acting and lousy story, but come on, it's a roller coaster film. I'm not sure I could put it in clearer writing for you about how we don't go to see movies like this for Oscar-winning actors or plot. I've always liked Bill Paxton (who I personally see as probably being the next Clint Eastwood), and I find it difficult about how he has somehow managed to avoid stardom. Here, his character seems to know how the storm functions and what it ""thinks,"" and in essence he's a human barometer (even his wild days as a radical storm chaser do deserve some laughs).

The writing is substandard, including Jo's barely-hinted upon obsession with chasing the storm (as a child, she saw her dad killed by a monster F5), Lois Smith as Jo's Aunt Meg (who supplies our famished heroes with platters of beef and eggs between effects scenes), the underdeveloped storm chasing team (some of whom are more colorful than others, including Philip Seymour Hoffman as Dusty), and the unnecessary subplot involving stiff competition from Cary Elwes as a corporate-sponsored rival who stole Bill's invention. But this isn't too glaring a problem, if you're a hard-a** for art in cinema and came to ""Twister"" expecting it. You'll see plenty scenes of destruction (just wait for the drive-in showing ""The Shining""), and the music that swells up when tornadoes appear.

Lastly, I can see how anyone who has experienced a twister in their lives could probably want to possibly stay from ""Twister."" I've never seen one and I don't want to. I do know people who have experienced tornadoes; in northern Virginia, where I live, we rarely see the kind of severe weather that produces twisters, but my grandparents, who live close to me, were once in an F1 and thankfully it caused minimal damage to their property and neighbors.

""Twister"" isn't a failure; it's a simple realization of the popcorn blockbuster. Put aside the hard-pressing of art, turn off your brain, and enjoy (but you should still watch out for those flying cows, tanker trucks, and other debris that can become a hostile projectile if picked up by a tornado's winds); it's that simple.

Striptease (1996),"""Striptease"" is a multi-award winning picture. Unfortunately, these are Razzie Awards---awards given for god-awful films and performances. It received an amazing seven nominations and took home six awards--including Worst Movie and Worst Actress! This puts the film is a very unique league...as few films have been nominated or won like ""Striptease"". This alone is the reason I watched the film...I was curious how bad this bad movie could be.

The film is about Erin, a divorced mother whose husband is a trashy criminal...yet we are to believe the judge game HIM custody. Regardless, this ex- made sure she lost her job and now she has been 'forced' to become a stripper. With no experience, she instantly becomes a star attraction and the men in the club go positively insane when she dances. During one of these times, a crazy congressman (Burt Reynolds) gets out of control and soon all sorts of unforeseen situations result.

So is this really a bad film? But what's surprising is that it's basically an ultra-low budget trash film...or that's what it looks like. Yet, inexplicably, the movie had a HUGE budget--including $12,000,000 for its star, Demi Moore!! Why they chose her, I have no idea as her appearing semi-naked didn't help the film to become a success. Instead, they could have easily gotten a cut-rate stripper and saved a LOT of money. And I think this huge budget and big studio treatment for essentially a trash film is why it got so many Razzies. If it was just some cut-rate trash film, no one would have noticed it and the film would have quickly disappeared.

The film suffers because it's a bizarro script that seldom makes sense, has characters who simply are caricatures instead of believable members of the human race and because the film cannot decide what it wants to be. Is it a comedy? Is it a raunchy film? Is it a drama about a mother trying to regain custody of her kid? Is it a murder mystery? Is it a film about politics and the abuse of power? Is it an episode of ""The Jerry Springer Show""? Any one of these might have worked...but together the film is just brain-achingingly weird and nonsensical--especially by the very end. Not bad enough to have earned 6 Razzies...but pretty bad."
Independence Day  1996),"Independence Day (1996) is an absolute blast of a movie that earns every bit of its perfect score. Directed by Roland Emmerich, this sci-fi extravaganza is a non-stop thrill ride, delivering heart-pounding action, mind-blowing visual effects, and a pure sense of fun that captivates audiences.

The storyline, featuring an otherworldly invasion threatening Earth, is a rollercoaster of excitement. Emmerich's direction keeps the adrenaline pumping, ensuring that the film never loses its momentum. From the get-go, viewers are treated to a spectacle of epic proportions as humanity faces an alien threat, making Independence Day a joyous celebration of cinematic entertainment.

What sets Independence Day apart is its groundbreaking visual effects, especially considering the era of its release. The scenes of enormous alien spacecraft looming over iconic landmarks are not only visually stunning but also became benchmarks for the possibilities of special effects. The sheer scale of destruction and chaos caused by the alien invaders is both awe-inspiring and a testament to the film's commitment to delivering a cinematic spectacle.

The ensemble cast, led by the charismatic trio of Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, and Bill Pullman, injects a tremendous amount of fun into the movie. Will Smith's infectious energy as Captain Steven Hiller, Jeff Goldblum's witty portrayal of David Levinson, and Bill Pullman's rousing speech as President Thomas J. Whitmore contribute to the overall sense of enjoyment. The chemistry among the cast members adds a layer of camaraderie that enhances the audience's connection to the characters.

Independence Day is not just a sci-fi action film; it's a feel-good celebration of humanity's resilience and unity in the face of a larger-than-life threat. Released on July 4th, the American Independence Day, the film's thematic resonance is accompanied by an infectious sense of patriotism and pride.

David Arnold's musical score complements the film's fun factor, adding to the overall enjoyment of the experience. And let's not forget one of the greatest speeches in movie history delivered by Bill Pullman as President Whitmore, a moment that still gives viewers chills and stands as an iconic cinematic highlight.

In summary, Independence Day is not just a movie; it's a joyous cinematic experience that has stood the test of time. Its perfect 10/10 rating is well-deserved for its exhilarating action, groundbreaking visuals, and the sheer fun it brings to the screen. Whether you're a fan of sci-fi or simply looking for a good time, Independence Day delivers on all fronts, earning its place as a timeless classic and a reminder that movies can be an absolute blast."
"Cable Guy, The (1996)","The Cable Guy has now all but been forgotten by the movie world. It was released when Jim Carrey was on his way to being the new A list comedian, and thus, was considered only a slightly funny version of 'Ace Venture'. or The Mask' Or whatever. Personally, I don't consider The Cable Guy a comedy at all. Sure, there are some side splitting moments - Carrey is hilarious alongside Matthew Broderick's by the numbers 'average Joe', but id suggest that anyone who was not taken in by this film to look at it a little differently...

This is a horror film. I swear!

For me, Chip Douglas does not come across to me as a harmless lisping clingy chump - HELL NO! The guy is a maniac. An obsessive, intelligent, controlling, stalking ""Fatal Attraction"" styled nutter!

Watch it again!

For me, this is Jim Carrey's career launching performance. He has a lisp right? after a while, you don't really notice it do you? Right. This is an incredibly difficult task for an actor - maintaining a speech impediment for an entire film, keeping it level, and not exaggerating it, its really something to take a look at. Carrey's character is sick, and very very creepy. With Broderick et al giving relatively standard performances, Carrey's performance is a stand out, and Ben Stiller should be proud of this film and what it lead to in terms of Jim Carrey's career.

Trust me, if you didn't like this, take another look, and prepare to be freaked out by a very not funny, very creepy Carrey performance...

"Frighteners, The (1996)","The Frighteners is a fun little movie from the mid-90s. It has an pleasing mix of stars who hit their stride in the 80s (Fox,Wallace, and Ermey) and others who count this as among their first works (Alvarado, Busey, McBride). It is an odd mix of horror and humor from Peter Jackson and had state-of-the-art special effects for the time.

The Frighteners, filmed and produced in New Zealand, was the biggest special effects movie made at that time outside the Hollywood movie base. It made extensive use of blue screens and had over 400 computer-enhanced special effects. Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh wrote the script and Jackson directed and produced the film.

The Frighteners has an overall tone of whimsy but also has some impressive horror movie moments. The Danny Elfman score fits the movie perfectly. Frank Bannister, played by Fox, is a widowed psychic investigator exploring supernatural goings on in a placid rural town. Newcomer Alvarado plays his romantic interest. Veteran actor John Astin plays a ghost called The Judge who has seen his better days. Ermey plays drill instructor (go figure), Sgt Hiles, who is in charge of the local cemetery. He has several lines and a general demeanor that pays homage or satirizes (depending on your viewpoint) his character in 1987's Full Metal Jacket. Jake Busey plays a good bad man, and McBride plays a funny role as Bannister's ghostly aide.

The Frighteners is amusing, frightening, entertaining, and a bit exhausting. It is a great Fall or Halloween movie."
Lone Star (1996),"If you're looking for an underwatched gem like i was, this isn't it. There is no central plot and all the sub plot stories that actually fill in the run time.......they are pretty bland and not worth your time.

And no i'm not some rightwinger who's ""triggered"" by the ""leftist"" politics where the teachers are telling the white people ""tell the kids the truth about our history and the Mexicans"". It's just that i don't need such surface level/uninspired racial drama when i can walk outside and see the same crap in the real world.

If you're going to make it political/racial at least do it well.

So if you're here for the politics don't bother, if you're hear for the mystery about the death, don't bother."
Phenomenon (1996),"An ex-girlfriend talked me into seeing this movie, and I am happy she did. In my opinion, John Travolta deserved at least a nomination for an Oscar here, if not the award itself. The story was decent, but the performances of Travolta, Forest Whitaker, Robert Duvall, and Kyra Sedgwick made me care about what was happening on the screen. By no means is this a romantic comedy. It's romantic, probably the most romantic film I have seen in a long time. The reason for that is simple...it's real. In most movies you see the main characters sleep together within a day at the most, which rarely happens with two people who are really in love. True love has to take time and effort, which is exactly what you see here. Travolta's George is patient, but not because he wants to be. If you're a romantic at heart you will understand and relate to him, and you will hope for his success as you would for your own. Without giving anything away, I will tell you that the ending is sad, but also heartwarming. George has his ""experience"" for no other reason than to suggest what we as humans can become. Phenomenon is a story about our potential, the good and bad things that can happen to us if we achieve it. We could only be so lucky, and watching the movie is a good start. I give it 8 out of 10 stars."
"Spitfire Grill, The (1996)","Percy (Alison Elliott), upon being released from prison, goes to the small town of Gillead, to find a place where she can start over again. She is taken in by Hannah (Ellen Burstyn), to help out at her place, the Spitfire Grill. Percy brings change to the small town, stirring resentment and fear in some, and growth in others.

Roger Ebert wrote, ""Watching this plot unfold, I was remembering last week's 'Heavy,' which also premiered at Sundance; its cafe was run by an older woman (Shelley Winters), and had a veteran waitress (Deborah Harry) and a young waitress (Liv Tyler), and had a regular customer whose name was Leo, not Joe, although he was played by Joe Grifasi. Also echoing in the caverns of my memory were several other movies about stalwart women running cafes and striding above the local gossip: The Ballad of the Sad Cafe, Fried Green Tomatoes, Staying Together and of course Bagdad Cafe."" Indeed, something about this film felt derivative or cheap, like it belonged on the Lifetime network and not as a film championed by the fine folks at Sundance. Some say this is a forgotten sleeper hit, and I disagree. Others say the score was overlooked, and that I will agree with. James Horner is one of the bigger names out there, and this effort is no exception."
Supercop (1992),"(I should preface this review by saying I sadly watched the Bluray release of this that only has the dubbed English track and the added rap music and what not. I also heard it has some scenes taken out and what not. A little disappointed by this copy, but oh well.)

Police Story 3 (Or Supercop) is certainly an entertaining film. Where it lacks in story, it certainly makes up for it in stunt work. Your jaw will constantly be on the floor during the action sequences.

The story here is... pretty weak. Jackie Chan goes undercover to stop... a bad guy who sells drugs? Or buys them? It can be quite unclear and confusing. So if anything brings this movie down, it would be the story.

Luckily, the film is jammed full of some amazing stunts. Chinese/Hong Kong action films almost always impress, and this film is no exception. The last 15 minutes of so has some really crazy stunt work. I have no idea how they allowed the actors and stunt men to do the things they do, because they are risking their lives by doing them. There's a fight on a moving train where they have no safety harnesses or anything. Jackie Chan hangs from a ladder on a helicopter that is flying extremely high above the city. Michelle Yeoh jumps onto a moving train on a dirt bike. It's crazy but makes the film exhilarating to watch. You feel the danger within the scene, and it's a thrill.

There's also a fair amount of comedy in this film, which is something that I can be a little weary about in action, but it works in this film. It surprisingly doesn't take away from the intensity, and it just works to make the film more entertaining and fun to watch.

This is a film that needs to be seen by action fans. It could have been stronger story wise, but it contains some stunts that many would consider among the best. Check it out if you wanna have some mindless, cheesy fun."
Bound (1996),"In my personal opinion, Bound is one of the most intelligent and erotic films ever made. It's not often that you see both of those words describing the same work of art.

I don't feel that the relationship between Corky and Violet is something that you should have to ""get past"" being that the tone of the film is that of escape (hence the title ""Bound"") and the very nature of their relationship upholds that idea. However if you are less open-minded regarding your own sexuality or completely homophobic, the scattered and brief exchanges between the two leading characters may not settle well with you. One of the best things about the film is the cinematic detail, all the little disturbing and intriguing things that the Wachowskis chose to hone in on...If you are a fan of The Matrix films, you'll really get to see where it all started with Bound.

I could rattle on forever about the pure genius of the film and that of the Wachowski Brothers but I won't. Just see the film for yourself, you'll either hate it or love it."
Kansas City (1996),"The music is superb. The movie is so-so. The period sets are perfect and its just like being back in KC during the infamous Pendergast era. Altman made this movie as a paean to his hometown and the music that came out of it. One cannot divorce the music from the movie. Either you are a jazz fan or you're not. If you're not, you won't like this movie. Its that simple. If you are, you are really in for a treat. The film features all of the ""new"" stars in jazz from the mid-90's (James Carter and Craig Handy on saxes, Mark Whitfield on guitar, Geri Allen and Cyrus Chestnut on piano....the list goes on and on. They all play the legends of jazz that came out of Kansas City-people like Count Basie, Joe Williams, Lester Young and Coleman Hawkins. A veritable treat for the in-the-know jazz fan but probably a bore for anyone else. Altman stays on the music longer than most directors would because this is a film about the music as much as it is about the plot.

And here's the real irony. Movie buffs will say they wished Altman wouldn't have devoted so much time to the music and jazz buffs will say they wished Altman would have done away with the ridiculous, annoying plot and grating performance by Jennifer Jason Leigh and focused entirely on the music. How to please everyone? The end result is uneven but there's enough here to keep all parties interested.

If any actor should be singled out, it should be Harry Belafonte. His turn as the underworld kingpin, Seldom Seen, is fantastic. He speaks in a low, gruff rasp but his dialogue is truly worth the effort to understand. When he goes off on the Marcus Garvey speech, its worth the price of admission. Of course, it helps to know who Marcus Garvey was. Jazz fans (and reggae fans, too) will get it. After all, this is a movie for them/us."
Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961),"Breakfast At Tiffany's is a pretty famous movie, it's recommended in my movie books and is usually on a top film critic's list as a classic. Before Roman Holiday, I had never seen an Audrey Hepburn film, and I have to say that I am becoming more and more of a fan of her's. She was so beautiful and very talented, not to mention she seemed like a very classy and elegant lady. But the film itself was a pretty good one, this was the movie that made romantic comedy clich√©s, so that's why I let it go so easily. It seemed like this film had what a lot of romantic comedy films steal now a days.

Holly is a huge socialite in her grand world, she finds happiness and joy in the jewelery store, Tiffany's. She is also being paid 100 dollars to visit a drug Mafia leader in prison to make his day. But things begin to change when a very handsome man moves in down stairs from her, Paul, but she calls him Fred since he looks like her brother. He's also in a similar situation where his ""Decorator"" is paying him for a good time. But together they find themselves helping one another and realizing they may need each other.

Breakfast at Tiffany's is an elegant classic that I would rate up with Seven Year Itch starring Marilyn Monroe. It has great humor and sizzling romance that anyone could fall in love with. Audrey Hepburn took on a role which the character could have been neuritic and annoying, but she made Holly into someone every woman would like to be. Her and George were great together, I would highly recommend Breakfast at Tiffany's, it's a great classic.

"Wizard of Oz, The (1939)","'The Wizard of Oz' is a very old movie and looks awfully dated, but still has its magic and charm. To this day it still has many fans, which is a surprise for a movie this old.

The sceneries/backgrounds and special effects don't impress by today's standards, but they must have caused great impact back in 1939. Plus, some of the special effects are astonishing for the time. Look at that tornado, for example! It just seems so real! Amazing that they could do something like that in such primitive times.

Speaking of the sceneries, they are full of creative and details which create this childish world of fantasy (the land of Oz). Looking at all those sceneries and to what people dress, it almost reminds me about those childish theater plays I used to see during my childhood. The yellow brick road and the Emerald City are just two among many creative and imaginative details of this movie.

The characters are as original as much as they are odd and unusual. The most bizarre characters are the army of flying monkeys, the Winkie Guards, the Wicked Witch of the East, the Munchkins, the talking trees and the Gatekeeper. The Scarecrow, the Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion are less weird, but still unusual. Dorothy and her cute dog Toto, Professor Marvel, Hunk, Zeke, Hickory, Auntie Em, Uncle Henry and the Wizard of Oz are normal characters.

Of all the 3 strange friends of Dorothy, the Scarecrow is my favorite. He is the funniest of them, even though the silly Cowardly Lion is hilarious.

To a degree, I can see why this movie is considered a classic. It consistently appears in the lists of the greatest movies ever. It is much praised and regarded by many people. It gets generally high ratings. Does it really deserve to be as venerated as it is? Well, it's all a matter of tastes. But despite its charm and magic, there are things of discussable taste in this movie, such as the bizarre characters which become tiring after many viewings. Certain scenes are also somewhat dark and sinister for a kids's movie.

The songs are simple but jolly and charming, such as ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"", ""We're Off to See the Wizard"", ""If I Only Had a Brain"" (in this last case, including its related songs) and my favorite: the wonderful opening music. I don't like the songs sung by the Munchkins because of their weird voices.

Although the movie is beyond dated and obsolete nowadays, it was nevertheless advanced for its time, thanks to the special effects and the fact that it is a sepia-toned black-and-white film in the Kansas sequences and a fully colored one (Technicolor) in the Oz sequences.

The actors are generally good in their roles. The best are Frank Morgan (who portrays a total of 5 roles in the film), Ray Bolger (as the Scarecrow and Hunk) and Judy Garland (as Dorothy Gale).

Filming was a nightmare. And yet the movie would become a lasting legacy, even though that was uncertain at the time."
Citizen Kane (1941),"Okay. First of all, I DO like many old movies. 12 angry men, Casablanca, Where Eagles Dare, Psycho, The Treasure of Sierra Madre, The Great Dictator, Some Like it Hot and more. They're all brilliant and I enjoyed them throughout.

But Citizen Kane...I just can't see what's so great about it. It made no impression on me whatsoever. When it comes to plot, camera-angles, themes, characters, acting and such, it seems like few movies are as praised as this. Still, when I read reviews on other classics, for example Casablanca, it feels like they say many of the same things.

I'm not an expert on what makes some films objectively better than others, but if the other classics with most of the other ""greatnesses"" actually ARE interesting and fun to watch, then Citizen Kane should also be able to entertain as well as just being ""great"".

You can say what you want about movies, but no matter how well they're made, they should also entertain in some way or another to be classified as great. And I'm not one of those guys who only like action movies. An example of a great movie is Requiem for a Dream. It's disturbing, repulsive and scary as h*ll, but I couldn't keep my eyes from it, and it made a brutal impression. Other examples of movies that are deep, makes an impression AND are entertaining could be One flew over the Cuckoos Nest, The Visitor, American Beauty and Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind.

But entertainment isn't all. I see that. If Citizen Kane had made an impression it wouldn't fail no matter how uninteresting. Taxi Driver is another movie I bored me through, and don't want to see again, but still I find it good because I couldn't stop thinking about it afterwards. It made an impression. Citizen Kane doesn't do that either.

And to all you die-hard-fans who hate me, wants to disgrace me, and finds it horrendous to call a classic ""not entertaining"" I'll just quote the great Ingmar Bergman: ""Citizen Kane is a total bore!"" To call me retarded or something like that would be to call one of the greatest directors of all time the same. In addition it's clear that many more agree as well. It's not long since the feature was in the top 3 on IMDb. Today it's number 29.

So all in all, I may not know how to judge objective qualities of movies, but I'm certain that movies that doesn't leave any impression whatsoever AND isn't entertaining at all aren't great no matter what. And that's why ""the greatest movie ever made"" fails for me. 3/10"
Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939),"Critics of ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" will call it cheesy, saccharine, and over-the-top in its character portrayals. Truth be told, I really can't call those critiques ""wrong"". But the thing is, this is such an endearing, aspirational film that I'm always able to look past the cheese-factor and enjoy the performances and overall message.

For a very basic overview, 'Mr. Smith Goes To Washington"" tells the story of Jefferson Smith (James Stewart), a wide-eyed, aww-shucks, country boy rube who gets nominated for a U. S. Senate seat in large part to be a straight-ticket voter for the political machine of Senator Joseph Paine (Claude Rains). Once in Washington, however, both get a rude awakening: Smith discovers the graft in politics, while Paine begins to realize--to his horror--that Smith isn't just going to ""tow the party line"".

This movie remains an all-time classic for me because of the earnestness of its message. It isn't quite as perfect as Capra's more famous ""It's A Wonderful Life"", but I do see similarities between the two pictures. Here, the story strikes such a simple--yet highly emotional--chord. Though deep down I think we all realize that corruption and compromise are likely unavoidable aspects of politics, we like to cling to ideals of honesty and supreme integrity. That is precisely the journey that Smith takes viewers on. This isn't ""politics as it is"", but rather ""politics as we want it to be"", and I think there is equal room for both in politically-minded films.

Of course, casting Stewart is the cherry on top of all this. I'm not sure there has been a better individual born to play the Jefferson Smith role. His stuttering, stammering, ""golly gee whiz"" routine is perfect, yet when the chips are down he delivers a filibuster monologue almost guaranteed to have you in tears. Rains is fine as the corrupt Senator and Jean Arthur has a nice sidekick supporting role, but ""Mr. Smith Goes To Washington"" is memorable because of Stewart. I very much liken his performance here to that of Henry Fonda's in ""12 Angry Men"". It's what we all wish we could be like--but know we'll probably never quite get there.

The only reason I can't give this a full 10 stars? It was made in 1939--or back when Hollywood didn't really know how to properly end movies other than an emotional flourish and a fade to black. With a less-rushed, more nuanced endgame, this one could have ascended even higher.

Overall, though, I consider this to be one of my favorite political films of all time. Make all the gritty, tough governmental thrillers you want (I love some of those too!), but I hold steady that a more aspirational, positive-minded effort like this isn't out-of-date or irrelevant simply because of that nature."
Big Night (1996),"When the British film magazine Sight & Sound had one of their periodic times of asking critics to list what they thought were the best films ever made, there was a book which collected articles by several of them, one of whom said that if you were the type of person who didn't tear up at THE BELLS OF ST. MARY'S, he didn't want to know you. I try to avoid that philosophy, but if I endorsed it, BIG NIGHT would be that type of film for me, a litmus test. This is a wonderful movie, and I usually am not a big fan of food movies. I thought BABETTE'S FEAST was too full of whimsy, and whimsy also bogged down the often good TAMPOPO(EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN, it could be argued, was a relationship movie which happened to be set in the world of food, where the others are inextricably food movies). But this was wonderful.

Tucci and Scott said they studied a lot of film masters, and it shows here; there's nothing that screams ""first film."" Instead, they take their time telling the story, and setting up characters we care about, even Pascal, the rival restaurant owner. And a lesser movie wouldn't have had the scene between Isabella Rosellini and Minnie Driver which is quiet yet moving, like the rest of the movie. The food scenes live up to the hype, and that final scene is moving."
D3: The Mighty Ducks (1996),"The first Mighty Ducks was great. Why make the next two? There are too many things in this one to comment on, but I'd like to go through a couple. First of all, weren't they the Junior National Team in the second one? And didn't they win the Junior Olympics? They weren't even one of those regional JO teams people play on, they were supposedly the entire U.S. So how come only one of them plays varsity? It's like, ""you may have been in the olympics, but this is high school hockey, and we're varsity, we're better than olympics"". If the varsity guys are so good, why weren't they olympics? Secondly, are they really freshmen? If I remember correctly, at the end one of them is kissing an upperclassman cheerleader. And there's no one some of them are freshmen. Third, high schools don't recruit entire teams, and close tryouts to no other freshmen than those on that team. It's against the rules. The only people that tried out were the Ducks and ""varsity"". Another thing, where's the Junior Varsity team? Schools don't do just Freshman and Varsity. Fourth, so many people are missing from the first movie. Danny Tamberelli's character and his sister were only in one movie. The brothers are gone, Jesse in the first two and Terry only in the first. The chunky kid and his dark-haired friend who always wore a hat were only in the first. You know what, I'm wasting my time talking about this movie, because it sucks. 1/10, only because I can't give a 0."
"Love Bug, The (1969)","David Tomlinson was always pretty reliable as the go-to comic English gent, and he delivers quite well here as the supercilious car dealer ""Thorndyke"". He only deals in the luxury end of the market, so ""Jim"" (Dean Jones) is a bit surprised to find a dilapidated old VW Beetle in his yard. There's something very special about this little car, and soon the down-on-his-luck driver and his mate ""Tennessee"" (Buddy Hackett) have bought him, repaired him and named him ""Herbie"". Magically, his racing fortunes take an about turn and pretty soon his erstwhile owner is after him back - and is prepared to go to just about any lengths as they prepare to compete in one trans-American race and - to the victor the spoils and the the scrapyard with ""Herbie"" if he doesn't win. It's interesting that this was released one year after ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" (1968) - so clearly the theme of magical cars was popular. ""Herbie"" is mischievous and not averse too the odd tantrum which gives him just enough of a personality, coupled with an on form Jones - to create an enjoyable tale of friendship and inter-reliance as well as one of fast-paced antics and even the slightest hint of romance as we tumble down mountains, slide in and out of mud and generally have our own sort of ""Whacky Race"". It's a bit over-scripted and probably twenty minutes too long - I think we all get the gist and could be getting on with the action a bit more quickly, but it's still a decent watch that reminds us of what was hugely popular in the late sixties."
Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey (1993),"Any time you settle in for a talking animal movie, one never knows how cheesy of a movie they are in for. Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey, the 1993 feature by director Duwayne Dunham was not plagued by some of the common problems in talking animal movies. The two dogs and a cat who make the incredible journey to find the owners they think have abandoned them, are well-written and given interesting enough personalities for the audience to get engaged in their stories and sit at attention with them until the very end. Setting out to find their owners and the only home they've ever known, the animals learn a lot about love and comradery along the way.

Life is good for Shadow (Don Ameche), Chance (Michael J. Fox), and Sassy (Sally Field). Both dogs and the cat are cared for and loved incessantly by their wonderful attentive owners. After their owners marry and their family grows, something unusual happens. They notice a lot of suitcases and they go to a strange place. Unbeknownst to them, Bob Seaver (Robert Hays) has gotten a researching job in San Francisco and will be temporarily locating the family there until his project is done. Leaving the animals at a friend of their female owner's, the family leaves with promises misunderstood by the animals of returning for visits. Perplexed at their loving owner's abandonment, Shadow is convinced a mistake has been made and encourages the dogs to follow him in an attempt to find their owners. Traversing the rough and wild terrain proves more than the animals anticipated, and soon wonder if they will be safe and loved ever again.

The visuals in Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey were strikingly captivating, much grander and more beautiful than I expected from a children's movie. The establishment shots in the beginning especially, were breathtaking capturing the true wilderness the animals would have to endure. Watching a family movie, one expects a decent amount of clean packaging, which did occur in Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey, it is easily forgiven however because the creatures were so well-written. It was fun to follow along with the main characters despite them not being human. Talking animal films are usually in a class by themselves as far as cheesiness. Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey doesn't suffer from such cheese, however. I believe, a large reason why Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey is so tolerable is because the animals mouths don't move in sync with their dialogue. I always thought that the synced mouth movements and dialogue was a peculiar choice for filmmakers of talking animal movies. The decision makes it no more believable that animals are actually talking simply because their mouths move like human's when they speak. A few brilliant filmmaking decisions, a beautifully shot film, and a perfect ending scene make Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey the perfect film from one's childhood with their own blossoming families."
"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954)","Right, I confess, I have a fascination with this film, but I don't understand why. True, James Mason was the man fate intended for the role of Nemo, and the Nautilus was design perfection.

However, I would like to point out one thing. Once again, Hollywood pisses on literature by tearing away the subtlety of the book and changing all the things that fascinate about the story. Jules Verne's Nemo was a mystery - nothing is ever found out by Aronnax or his associates about this enigmatic figure. Yet Disney goes further than to even suggest his past, it becomes integral to the plot.

The beauty of Verne's work is that it is scientific intrigue set against human struggle, yet this version does not do the novel the justice of presenting this as an important side. Not to mention that the emphasis is shifted from Aronnax to the questionable comic duo of Conseil (about as different from Verne's character as it is possible to be) and Land.

As an avid reader of Verne, it is not possible to show how disappointing the ""best film version"" of this book is. Oh, and where the hell did the music come from?!"
Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971),"It's 1940 England. Rawlins siblings Charlie, Carrie, and Paul join the mass evacuation of London children to the countryside. Miss Eglantine Price (Angela Lansbury) reluctantly agrees to take in the kids temporarily. She lives in a remote farm. She's overjoyed to receive a broom and become an apprentice witch from the Emelius Browne Correspondence College of Witchcraft. She casts a spell on a bedknob for Paul to make the bed transport vast distances. The school announces its closure and Miss Price takes the kids to London to find Emelius (David Tomlinson). He's surprised that his adaptation of an old spell book actually worked for her. It's high adventure to the animated animal island of Naboombu and then a fight against the Nazis.

This is sorta like Mary Poppins but not quite as good. Angela Lansbury is good but she's no Julie Andrews. The songs are not quite as catchy. It's even got the similar animated world for the actors to play with. I can do without the Nazis in a kids movie. This is certainly not too soon but it's still questionable to have a Nazi battle, no matter how comedic, in a family film."
Die Hard (1988),"First off this movie is WAAAAY too long for its rather thin plot. The first act/exposition wastes way too much time to introduce its paperthin characters and is full of cheesy, vapid 80s smack talk.

Second, the acting is absolutely horrid across the board (Alan Rickman excepted). Willis and Bedelia are bland and listless, and have zero chemistry. Also why are American and British actors cast to play Germans? Their accents are hilarious. The only real German here is Andreas Wisniewski, who is completely wasted in a bit part; a far cry from his memorable turn in ""Living Daylights"" (a film that easily blows this one out of the water).

And finally the slew of plot holes and contrivances which require the hero not to be extremely smart but the villians to be extremely dumb.

The sequels are much better, including the maligned 5th entry."
"Lawnmower Man, The (1992)","It's a bit 'B', a bit dated, but with redeemable characteristics. Some of the writing is pretty good. The direction was hammy, but at least the tone is managed well, over-all. Dr. Angelo's character is given a little berth to pass off as a realistic character; this invites us to identify with him as a ""voice of reason"" in a cartoonish sci-fi universe.

Of course, the whole thing uses the misunderstood tech trope of the year, ""virtual reality"", boosted by mind-altering drugs, as a hook for yet-another story about man's effort to cosmically transcend. This is a strained notion, as any technically savvy dude or dudette knows. So the whole thing rides on a willing suspension of disbelief. The question remains whether this act of suspension rewards us with a sustainable, ennobling myth.

Well, my attempt to give the flick a slight jolt by voting it a '7' is an indicator. The flick is surely dated, but not bad for its time. Where the story fails to fully ennoble, it at least maintains a sense of momentum; I found it quite watchable.

At the very least, it worth watching as a heroic effort by the producers to mythically bend new (at the time) tech toward a moral fable about humankind's perennial tech hubris expressed as yet-another effort to bite off more than can reasonably be chewed.

I was particularly struck by an interesting form taken by the usual story-management effort to keep Dr. Angelo's karma clean: That the dosing of his human subject with the ""next-stage"" experimental drugs was effected without his knowledge, via subterfuge by admins; not by the researcher (Angelo) himself. Very clever plot point, that!

Anyway. It's not a great flick, but may be worth watching as a kind of worthy period piece. It's a bit of an aesthetic casualty of the 'B'-flick hewings of production folks of the time: If you factor that out, you can see the glimmerings of decent sci-fi."
Unhook the Stars (1996),"I recently purchased this film at a local video store as I am a big fan of Jake Lloyd, Marisa Tomei and Gerard Depardieu. They're all excellent actors with tremendous talent - they all shine in this spectacular comedy. One of the most memorable scenes is when Monica (Marisa Tomei) swears openly to her ""date"" on the phone with her son J.J. (Jake Lloyd) a few feet away at the dinner table during Thanksgiving (check out the dinner). I mean, what would a movie starring Marisa Tomei be like without having her saying ""f***"" in it? Honestly. And what about Gerard....how can you not get hungry watching his movies - the man and food, I don't know. He did, of course, a great job as a French-Canadian truck driver. Then there's Jake Lloyd. Does this kid ever not give an excellent performance? I mean really. He shines as sweet little J.J. Also look for other great performances by Moira Kelly, David Thornton, and Bridgette Wilson. Great cast overall. This film was well worth the purchase and just cries out for multiple viewings. However Cyndi Lauper's theme song is terrible. But of course R.E.M.'s ""Country Feedback"" is always welcome. Terrific film."
"Long Kiss Goodnight, The (1996)","Definitely a movie for people who ask only to be entertained and who do not over-think their movies.

Lots of action, lots of great dialogue (e.g. fun to quote), a little intrigue, and stuff blowing up all over the place. Samuel L Jackson and Geena Davis had great chemistry. Violent, but not gory. The fact that the female part was the competent action lead is a pleasant turn-about.

Have seen the movie more than a dozen times and still enjoy it enough to put it back in my favorite films rotation every 3 or 4 months. I initially rented the movie because Samuel L Jackson was in the film, but was caught up in the events surrounding Samantha's quest to regain her memory and have never looked back.

All you cerebral folks out there -- suspend disbelief for once, take yourself a little less seriously -- you might actually enjoy yourselves!"
"Ghost and the Darkness, The (1996)","I always found this to be an outstanding based-on a true story adventure film which holds your interest throughout. It features some great suspense and the story is fascinating. It's always been ranked among my top 50 movies. A good surround system doesn't hurt here, either.

Stan Winston, one of the best special-effects men in the business, lent his talents to this film while Val Kilmer and Michael Douglas are more than adequate in the starring roles and the African with the freckles (sorry, I don't have his name) is really a likeble fellow.

Except for the first one, the lion attack scenes are not gruesome and the filmmakers did a nice job a having just the right amount of action and lulls. Neither is overdone. This film has never been given much due but I've never shown it to anyone who didn't thoroughly enjoy it.

This movie scared me so much I stopped hunting lions. It's just not fun anymore."
Jude (1996),"Thomas Hardy's Jude the Obscure is a very complicated and ambitious book, and while heavy-reading it is a fine piece of literature. This 1996 film adaptation is a rock-solid adaptation, that is ambitious and realistic. I will admit some parts like the killing of the pig is anything but tender, but none of the scenes are over-sensationalised.

As an adaptation of the book, it works very well. If I had a quibble, the secondary characters could have been developed more than they were depicted. The screenplay is well crafted; the writers and the director have at least some idea how Hardy's work should work on film and stay relatively true to the book. The music both haunting and beautiful at the same time was absolutely outstanding.

The direction is very fine, never sluggish and never overdone. It was about right. The cinematography is superb, dark, fluid and sensitive. And the period detail was just as good. It was this element alone that contributed to the mood of the adaptation. The love story here which is dirty and tragic was beautifully realised, and very rarely struck a false note.

The performances were just brilliant, no overplaying or underplaying as far as I could see. Special mention must go to the two lead performances. Christopher Ecceleston is a very talented and I think under-appreciated actor, and in the title role he was perfectly cast and showed real versatility. As Sue Brideshead, the beautiful Kate Winslet is positively luminous and is true to her character. Out of the supporting performances, the best is Rachel Griffiths as Arabella, a very modest performance I must say.

Overall, has its minor flaws but a very well done adaptation of a complicated book. Always realistic and never overly-sentimental as I feared. Though the ending is heart-rending. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
Swingers (1996),"This movie was a great find. It's from the 90's. But it felt like a breath of fresh air. This is exactly what a guy like my age should see. This is a great guys movie. Swingers is a label which you can call bunch of guys hanging out and flirting with chicks. They have a very high self-esteem and big mouths. And they look stylish. And they are. They're swinging.

The story here concentrates on Mikey (Jon Favreau) who's having a difficulties to get over with a broken relationship. His friends try to help him. And there comes a lesson. It shows how important is to have a real friends around you. It's great to see that. The bunch of comedians (Jon Favreau, Vince Vaughn, Ron Livingston) are young here. And they offer more than one or two humorous scene.

So if you're a guy over 20, you should see that movie. According to Trent (Vince Vaughn) 'you are so money that you don't know that'. He keeps telling that to Mikey (Jon Favreau) all the time and probably he has right. Well, I say that the film is money and I have probably right too."
Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971),"This movie is endearing, but I have to say ... the book is better! Forget the images that come with the movie, your imagination conjures up visions way beyond the limits of any special effects!

But still, not a bad version of the book. The actors are all adequate, but Gene Wilder is fantastic, the best thing about the movie - he was the only aspect in the movie which was at least as good as what I envisioned while reading the book, if not better. And watch out for the twinkle in his his eyes! :)

This is also one of those movies where knowing the story beforehand doesn't really do much damage when you actually watch it, if anything you anticipate what happens.

Really the only thing to criticize - is that the movie isn't as good as our own imaginations. The other criticisms just make me laugh. Granted the special effects aren't that cutting-edge, but hey, this was made years ago and it's OK considering! Also I don't really feel it's too 'scary' for kids... I know lots of children who think that Roald Dahl's stuff are cool, and no, they don't grow up to become mass murderers. And true, there is a dark side to it, but it's got a good message to send. If anyone got traumatized, they probably grew up like a glass bubble. I'm not a kid anymore and I do still know how to enjoy it, perhaps it's even more amusing because you really get to appreciate the intelligence of the absurdity and the fun of the exaggerations that Dahl inevitably dishes out. It's silly, but perhaps that's why you love it.

Another thing ... really interesting to watch out for if you're familiar with the great works of Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde etc ... I haven't read all, but enough to catch some of the quotes from their works deliciously sneaked into the dialogue here. For example, ""Parting is such a sweet sorrow"" from Romeo and Juliet by Shakespeare, and ""The suspense is terrible. I hope it lasts"" from The Importance of Being Earnest by Wilde, among others.

I especially love one of the last lines in the movie where Dahl shows his total ability for sweet innocence (and Wilder delivers it to perfection) when Wonka tells Charlie, ""And Charlie: don't forget what happened to the man who suddenly got everything he'd ever wished for."" and Charlie asks, ""What happened?"" and this is when you're sure that he's gonna give you one of those righteous, cautionary, adult message of the preachy kind when he says, magically, ""He lived happily ever after."" *sigh* ..."
Sleeper (1973),"We are blessed that Woody was around, making movies as interesting as this when he was.

Already with this one, he began his vast exploration of movie techniques and devices that would last 25 years or so.

The idea is simple in this one: he wanted to use film slapstick from a bygone era. How better to situate that than to move the whole picture into a future era?

We have some truly classic stuff here. The banana joke, The mirror joke. The robot pantomime. The acting out of the Jewish dinner (done in later movies too). The inflated man joke. You can find all these in any number of Keaton. Marx, Laurel & Hardy movies.

The unifying string of time travel, a romance, the leader and his nose is too weak to make this a solidly recommended outing. And it wouldn't be for a couple years until Woody cared about the cinematography at all.

I had forgotten how pretty Diane Keaton was. Very.

Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."
"Fish Called Wanda, A (1988)","A Fish Called Wanda (1988) : Brief Review -

Sexually absurd, yet attractive and stimulating. Jamie Lee Curtis' vulgar femme fatale has done the job. Charles Crichton's heist comedy is not a pure family film; rather, it's vulgar and sexually absurd. The maverick and no-limit femme character of Jamie will stimulate you as a viewer, especially male audiences. There are some loopholes in the script that need a little attention, but that's alright as long as the gags keep coming. Nevertheless, there are a few issues with the film that I'll disclose in brief. A Fish Called Wanda revolves around a robbery, and there is a girl as the central character who traps three men in her sexual desires for the diamonds. Her lover is arrested after being tipped off by her brother (and her), but he was smart enough to hide the treasure before going behind bars. Well, the girl also has a sexual relationship with her brother, who speaks Italian and stimulates her. ""Even if you are my brother, I still want to F you,"" she says (that's absurd and rubbish, though). Then she traps a married barrister so that she can get him to talk about the treasure once her lover is sentenced to jail. This part is damn funny and sexually attractive, but seriously, how can you have a well-educated barrister with an IQ level of a KG student? Her ideas are simple yet are never challenged by any male characters-that's what hurts the most about the script. In one scene, the barrister is caught nude by tenants, who apparently know him already, but did that cause any alarm about his identity and personal life? No. That's childish. And wait a second, why didn't they catch the girl who was right there, upside the stairs? Jamie's sex appeal has covered many loopholes, and this fishing tale manages to trap the audience. Overall, a fantastic sex comedy with an outdated femme fatale touch.

RATING - 7/10*

Dirty Dancing (1987),"I just read a number of user reviews, and all I have to say is that ""You're all sick!!!""

This lamebrained, terribly scripted, terribly constructed, terribly acted movie is your ""Favorite Movie of All Time?""

This is the movie that made me avoid ""Ghost"" for over a year (definitely a mistake), because after seeing this, I incorrectly assumed that anything with Patrick Swayze in it was just going to be BAD.

The story's been told before (repeatedly, I might add). Even if the story hadn't been told before, every aspect of the movie is completely predictable. Most of the dialogue is more laughable than most spoofs of ""Star Trek"" (at least when those people are spoofing Shatner as Kirk, they're ""trying"" to be funny). And the acting--ugh, even if the dialogue wasn't so bad, most of the principals are so wooden you could use them as surfboards.

The dancing scenes--okay, they were pretty good. But unless you're Kelly, Astaire, or Rogers, dance scenes do not a good movie make.

I can see people being entertained by this movie. I really can (just not me). But to call it your favorite movie of all time? AAAARRRRGGGHHHH!"
Reservoir Dogs (1992),"It's hard to imagine that anyone has NOT heard that ""Reservoir Dogs"" is an ultra-violent film, but just in case you haven't, please understand that this is a super-duper ultra-violent film--and a film that many, many out there will find too difficult to watch or will traumatize you. I am not kidding...think twice before you decide to watch it and for heaven's sake, DON'T LET KIDS SEE THIS FILM.

Now, despite this intense warning, I greatly respect the film--especially since it was made for next to nothing and without the big studio money. Despite its violence, the film is very smartly written, directed and acted. Quentin Tarantino was able to assemble a rather amazing cast of bad-boy actors--and in many, many ways is a modern version of film noir. And, to give the film that cache, he managed to get a great noir character actor, Lawrence Tierney (in real life a total nut) to give the film an air of menace and class.

Because so much on IMDb has already been written about this film and because it's in the IMDb Top 250, there just isn't a great need to discuss the film at length. Suffice to say that it is bloody, full of obscenities and extreme violence (though, to his credit, Tarantino did on many occasions make the actual violence occur off-camera). And, it's brilliant--with a great ending (full of vagueness and a noir-like downbeat ending) and is sure to please the right audience."
Weekend at Bernie's (1989),"Weekend at Bernie's really isn't a very good film. The premise--two wacky guys try to pretend their dead boss is not only still alive, but still the life of the party--may sound like it has potential on paper. But once the title character dies we suddenly realize that there is not much more you can do with a dead body than carry it around, move its head back and forth, wave its arms in the air, and so on. And that's exactly what happens here. For about an hour and a half.

Andrew McCarthy shows some genuine talent playing the smarmy smooth-operator Larry, and Jonathan Silverman is equally adept as Larry's straight-arrow buddy, Richard. Even Terry Kiser is about as good at playing a dead guy as anyone could hope for. But in the end, this is a physical comedy, an action-oriented film, and the only action possible is for McCarthy and Silverman to carry a limp Kiser around while attempting to make funny remarks about what they are doing. Excessive performances by other characters, particularly the party-goers and mob killer, only serve to remind us that this is the comedic equivalent of a melodrama that has no plot.

Perhaps with a more intelligent screenplay and a little less reliance on physical comedy Weekend at Bernie's could have had potential."
Basic Instinct (1992),"You know a movie achieves its objective when you think that a character is sexier than the person that plays her. That is exactly what Catherine Tremell does. She exudes sex and that is exactly her game. She knows that she can play with people's minds by using her beauty and her sex appeal. And she does it so well.

The epitome of this is the interrogation scene. Much has been made about nudity in film but this is one of those movies where every breast and every shot of someone's crotch is done so to further the plot. The famous scene that we have all witnessed now is a major part of Tremell's M.O. She knows there are a room full of men asking her questions and she uses that sexuality to play with them. And it works.

The cast and the script and the direction are top notch and the movie feels like it is one big game. And Catherine Tremell is the ultimate game master. I really loved this film and I rate it a perfect ten."
Glengarry Glen Ross (1992),"Man! What a depressing movie. The life of a salesman is tough and by the looks of it, the life of a property salesman is the absolute pits. I've never had much sympathy for the likes of salespersons; they badger you, they interrupt your day, and they lie.

I remember when I bought a Kirby vacuum from a door-to-door salesman. He sold my wife on it so I come home and I'm $1800 poorer. They gave us a contract that was 18 months 0%. Well, the bank called and said, ""So, we have a contract here for 12 months 0%.""

I said, ""No. It's 18 months 0%.""

The bank said, ""We don't do 18 month 0% contracts.""

I said, ""Then void it and come get your vacuum.""

Ricky (Al Pacino), Shelley (Jack Lemmon), George (Alan Arkin), and Dave (Ed Harris) were in the business of selling property for Premiere Properties, a hole in the wall company in New York. They would do anything to make a sell--and who wouldn't if you depended on it to eat everyday. They are good salesmen, even if they *ahem* bend the truth a little bit, but even a good salesperson needs good leads.

I think they said the word ""lead"" about 100 times in the span of an hour and 40 minutes. They wanted the good leads and didn't want the old stale leads. It was a miserable existence.

I think the cast of ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" made the matter of property sales about as interesting as could be. The topic itself is not that enthralling, so to make a movie about it in which the audience doesn't go to sleep is admirable. I think all the performances were great, with Jack Lemmon and Pacino being the best. Did I ever feel sorry for them. I'm still shutting down any salesman that tries to pitch me, but I do feel sorry for them."
On Golden Pond (1981),"A few things struck me while I was watching ""On Golden Pond"". The obvious thing was the co-starring of two generations of Fondas. I understand that Henry Fonda and Jane Fonda hadn't been on the best terms due to her political activism in the '60s, and so this movie was a sort of reconciliation for both of them.

As for the plot, the movie comes across as a ""nice movie"" that you can take the kids to see. Katharine Hepburn's ""knight in shining armor"" quote pretty much sums up the movie's feeling. I'm not saying that it's a bad movie, just a little too fluffy. It's a surprise seeing Jane Fonda and Dabney Coleman play wife and husband, since they had just played enemies in ""9 to 5"".

Basically, it's a watchable movie, but not any sort of masterpiece. Probably worth seeing once. So strange to think that Henry Fonda won an Academy Award for the role and died a few months later."
"Return of the Pink Panther, The (1974)","The Pink Panther has been stolen from a museum in Lugash despite the impenetrable security. In France, Chief Insp. Charles Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) suspends bumbling policeman Jacques Clouseau (Peter Sellers) for six months. The commissioner orders Dreyfus to reinstate Clouseau to be sent to Lugash to investigate the theft. Lady Claudine Litton claims that the Phantom is the only one capable of the crime but her husband Sir Charles Litton (Christopher Plummer) maintains his innocence. He decides to catch the thief to clear his name.

Dreyfus and Clouseau remain one of the great comedic pairing. Their early back and forth is absolutely hilarious. Dreyfus is missed as Clouseau sets off alone. They are better together. It takes too long for both Dreyfus and Cato to reunite with Clouseau. Those two have the potential to pump up the slapstick comedy. I love the smaller bits of sly humor like the local who knows the location of the hotel and simply continues to walk away. It is gloriously dead-pan. There is the iconic Clouseau falling backwards into the pool following the bikini girl. This movie is full of great physical humor. I doubt the plot actually matters."
"Abyss, The (1989)","The Abyss is one of the best sci-fi action/adventure movies ever made. Besides the ""usual"" ingredients of excitement, characterization and great narrative technique, the movie really scores on the wonder factor. The amazing, jellyfish-like aliens and their manipulation of water... A superb story incorporating the use of a then-recent SFX breakthrough to absolute perfection. A timeless story with great actors, great characters, great emotional substance.

The story is fabulous. It is about the very survival of humanity, drawing on that time-honored science fiction trope: will we be so stupid and disorganized that we cause our own destruction, or will love and reason prevail, inaugurating a great and harmonious future for our species? In thinly veiled symbol terms, this movie demonstrates how we will reach the brink of destruction due to our own folly, but can be redeemed if we rediscover the love and wonder that we once lost.

My rating: A clear 10 out of 10.

P.S. Coffey's first name is... Hiram?!?! BWAAAH-HA-HA-HA!!!!"
Jean de Florette (1986),"""Ugolin"" (Daniel Auteuil) returns from the war to his wealthy uncle ""Papet"" (Yves Montant) with some inspiration. He doesn't divulge his cunning plan until he is ready, and then presents the man with some perfectly cultivated carnations. It turns out there's money in flowers, but they also need a great deal of water. Gallons and gallons of the stuff. It occurs to ""Papet"" that their curmudgeonly neighbour might be willing to sell his land, upon which there is a clogged-up spring. No such luck there but an accident shortly afterwards fills them with hope. Sadly for them, their plans are further frustrated by the arrival of the hunch-backed and enthusiastic city boy ""Jean"" (G√©rard Depardieu) and his wife and child who move onto the farm. They are decent and hard-working relatives of the dead man and are determined to use science to make a go of things. Whilst feigning friendship with the family, ""Ugolin"" and ""Papet"" cement over their water supply and leave them at the mercy of the unpredictable weather and a rather ropey cistern system. Their farming days would appear to be doomed unless God intervenes. What now ensues sees the family ""Cadoret"" increasingly struggle to make money breeding rabbits and growing fruit and vegetables - amidst the mother of all heatwaves, as their cognisant neighbours look on unwilling to point out that their salvation is buried but yards away. Will the cynical ploy of the ""Soubeyran"" clan prevail? There's a great cast doing the work here, with Auteuil especially effective as the slightly conflicted nephew who doesn't always come across as the full shilling; Montand as the calculating, dynastically motivated, manipulator and finally a great effort from Depardieu who manages to portray a man plumbing the depths of despair - whilst always seemingly open to a degree of optimism and hope, really compellingly. The drama is peppered with loads of earthy humour and the small town setting provides for many of the usual characterisations of village life that is sceptical of, if not downright hostile to, new arrivals. It's also quite a potent look at just how crucial running water is, too. It continues through into ""Manon de Source""..."
Manon of the Spring  1986),"The full title of this film is ""Manon des Sources. Part II of Jean de Florette"". The original version of ""Manon des Sources"" in 1951 was directed by Marcel Pagnol and told the story in one four hour long marathon. Later Pagnol elaborated the story in his novel ""L'eau des Collines"". In 1986 this was made into the two-part film under the faultless direction of Claude Berri. The two films were made in succession so they can quite rightly be regarded as two parts of the same film. Unfortunately hints and clues abound in part I making part II little more than a perfunctory exercise, albeit admirably performed by masters of the art, with an inevitable unfolding of events. After the death of Jean the teenage Manon (Emannuelle Beart) tends a herd of mountain goats in the hills above C√©sar's farm whilst her absent mother is a member of an opera company in Marseilles. As she grows up Manon gradually pieces together bits of village gossip until she realises how the villagers have remained silent while C√©sar connived to get the piece of land and spring from her parents' farm. She then accidentally stumbles on a way of getting her own back but with unexpected consequences. By the end of the first hour the film drags due to the slow telling of the story and also the sparsity of characters. Suddenly it comes to life as we meet many of the other villagers including the mayor and the priest. There is so little to tell that it pales in comparison with Jean de Florette despite possessing many of the qualities of that film i.e. superb acting, direction and photography. It is little more than an ending tacked on. As even the twist at the end was signalled in Part I, I would have preferred a single but longer film telling the whole story at one viewing. I was surprised at the large number of reviewers who found the final twist unexpected; I can only conclude that today's cinema audience, having been weaned on films in which everything is explicitly stated, is unable to read messages hidden in the film.

I am glad to report that the problems with subtitling I commented on in J de F have are no longer apparent apart from the intrusion of ""orology""; also the occupation of Jean's father is now satisfactorily rendered as ""blacksmith"" in place of the previous cryptic ""farrier"".

I have not seen the 1951 version but critics consider it better than J de F and M des S. Let's not forget that Pagnol was The Master so perhaps his way was the right way? I wish they would put his version on TV one day then we can tell for ourselves."
Private Benjamin (1980),"Sigh. The innocent 80's and what used to pass for a movie way back when. I remember first seeing this movie in the theater 30 years ago and being mildly amused by Judy and Company. I should have left it at that.

While camped-out at a friend's horse ranch, I found the movie on VHS and decided for a trip down memory lane. Big mistake. How this over-rated comedy ever became nominated for THREE Oscars baffles me to no end. Guess it was a SLOW year for comedy in 1980.

The screenplay and acting is on the same level as a bad sit-com. The acting is cardboard and sophomoric. The plot? Beyond simplistic. The entire package presented couldn't suspend the disbelief of present-day 12 year old.

Just a pile of disorganized fluff that never should have made the big screen but should have been adequate for a made-for-TV-movie now long forgotten and mercifully so."
