1,Toy Story (1995),01-Jan-1995,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['Animation', ""Children's"", 'Comedy']"," With the ever increasing proximity of Toy Story 3, I decided it was about time for me to revisit the original and its first sequel to refresh my memory. Having been among the original target audience, it's a real trip back to childhood.

The longtime favourite toy of young Andy, Woody is disgruntled to be pushed aside in favour of a new space-ranger action figure in the form of Buzz Lightyear. Admired by child and fellow toys alike, Buzz threatens Woody's territory, prompting an effort to remove him which results in the two being left many miles from home, with little time to get back before the family's move.

Now regarded fondly as one of the best kids' movies of all time, Toy Story was the catalyst which allowed Pixar to rapidly ascend to the throne of animation where they dominantly remain to this day. Certainly it wowed me when I first saw it, almost fifteen years ago now. Indulging every child's fantasy that their toys come to life when they're not looking, we find ourselves instantly aligned with the host of strange characters. The quality of the animation, revolutionary for its time, is seen instantly, proudly boasted in the movements of the soldiers as they march downstairs. Everything looks completely realistic and, most importantly, believable. Whilst amusing beforehand, the laughs only really start to build up when Buzz arrives and we are treated to his interactions with Woody, the disagreements between the two and their petty arguments forming the basis of the film's funny factor. The added maturity of years affords the understanding of some of the film's more adult jokes, adding a little something extra to the experience for returning viewers. The action-adventure side of the plot keeps up the drama, tension, and sense of doom, keeping us wondering whether or not the reluctant duo will ever make it back in time. The scenes in Sid's house are the film's best, in terms of keeping up suspense. Their oddness is stand-out and ever memorable, the stranger toys therein encountered doubtlessly having haunted many little 'uns over the years. Certainly still enjoyable, Toy Story remains an inherently good film, though for me it stands less high than the likes of Wall-E, lacking the considerable emotional impact of that later Pixar effort.

Carrying a vast legacy, Toy Story stands the test of time well, still as enjoyable as ever it was. Having paved the way for films which, as you would hope, took what it did and did them better, it is enduring, endearing, and thoroughly entertaining."
2,GoldenEye (1995),01-Jan-1995,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Thriller']"," This movie fully deserves it's status as a classic in the action/thriller/spy/drama category. It's so much fun, well written, solid dialogue and yet it finds that sweet spot with just the right amount of classic Bond ridiculousness. Famke Jensenn playing Onatopp, a soviet assassin who kills men by riding them to death in bed? Yup, sounds like a Bond movie. Judi Dench absolutely kills it as M, I love the gravitas and complexity she brings to the role. Even back in 1995 calling out Bond, what some would consider to be the fictional epitome of toxic masculinity and chauvinism, and saying he's a dinosaur and that she has no problem sending him off to die if she has to. Love her so much in this. As for Bond himself, this may be because I grew up in this period but I have always loved Brosnan in the role. Yes, the later films get exponentially more absurd and the quality absolutely goes down but he is so perfectly cast as the suave, charming and devilish-at-times international man of mystery. That man wears the hell out of those suits, drinks a martini with the best of them and looks just right in that Aston Martin.

Definite recommend for people interested in a solid action flick. The plot is a little crazy, but that was perfectly in line with when it was made and the style of film it's going for. Easily worth a rent."
3,Four Rooms (1995),01-Jan-1995,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,['Thriller']," When I was in high school, anything Tarantino-related was required to be memorized. Yes, even this one was insisted upon in high school, though perhaps not as strongly as QT's first two. This portmanteau follows bellhop Tim Roth as he gets into several adventures over New Year's Eve. I remember liking this one quite a bit, but, viewing it now, it's just too uneven to be worthwhile. Anders' first segment is easily the low point, thankfully. Any film starring Madonna should be immediately suspect, and everything about this tale of witches is awful. Rockwell's segment is a bit of an improvement, but too forgettable. Rodriguez's segment is the one I remember being the best, and it thankfully does hold up okay. Antonio Banderas is hilarious in it, and most of the jokes hit. I remember QT's segment being the worst originally, but I actually thought it was by far the best this time around. It usually gets flack, I think, because it stars Tarantino, but he's comfortable here playing a pompous movie director. It's honestly his best performance (if it had been readily available, I might have suffered through Destiny Turns on the Radio again) and his direction is pretty brilliant. The one thing that really drags this whole movie down is Tim Roth. Man, I remember loving him when I was a teenager, and, though I criticized his performance in Reservoir Dogs above, he's on Olivier's level there compared to his awful mugging here. Even if QT's segment were the weakest, it would automatically be upgraded to the strongest just because he's the only one who settles Roth the crap down, a bit at least."
4,Get Shorty (1995),01-Jan-1995,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['Action', 'Comedy', 'Drama']"," The mobster flick mixes with show business in ""Get Shorty,"" the mob comedy from ""The Addams Family"" director Barry Sonnenfeld. The two (mob movies and Hollywood) have always gotten along well together from ""The Godfather"" to ""Goodfellas,"" so ""Get Shorty"" taking the humorous business angle is only a natural evolution. Starring John Travolta hot off of ""Pulp Fiction,"" it's an enjoyable film for those who love movies and those who love the mob.

""Get Shorty"" is mostly about the former. Chili Palmer (Travolta) is a loan shark/shylock who flies out to Hollywood to collect a debt and partly to avoid his new boss, Ray Bones, the perfect jerk with a foul mouth played by Dennis Farina. In LA, Palmer meets producer Harry Zimm (Gene Hackman) and becomes fond of the movie business, offering to help Zimm get some lenders who've invested in one of his films off his back.

There's some strong irony between the movie business and mob movies, e.g. Chili pitches the story of why he's out in LA as a movie idea to Zimm who thinks he's got something, but its the rock solid performances of Travolta, Hackman, Farina and Delroy Lindo that sell you on ""Get Shorty.""

Film-lovers will appreciate many references from ""Touch of Evil"" to ""Three Men and a Baby"" as the movie takes plenty of shots at the industry. Those more into the mob angle will enjoy how everyone's out to get everyone -- some for legitimate reasons, others because they want in on the movie business. It displaces the gangster movie from its cozy home in New York, Boston or Miami and drops it into the glitz of Hollywood where it fits well seeing as the industry is not exactly the cleanest.

""Get Shorty"" is not overly impressive, maintaining interest through its performances and our wondering just when one of these guys is going to up the stakes and off someone -- such are the thrills of a mob movie. Its lack of a definitive objective and therefore constant evolution into a story about something other than what it started as definitely holds it back, but not beyond of the point getting to enjoy it. ~Steven C

5,Copycat (1995),01-Jan-1995,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'Thriller']"," An interesting idea here is that we have two professional women dealing with the issue of violence against women. Sigourney Weaver plays Helen Hudson, author and expert on serial killers who becomes agoraphobic after an encounter with a killer. Holly Hunter plays M.J. Monahan, slightly nasal lead detective who smiles a lot and looks just out of high school but who can be as steely and relentless as any male cop.

Most of the plot binds Helen and M.J. in their pursuit of an intelligent serial killer who terrorizes San Francisco. It's the chemistry between the two women that make ""Copycat"" somewhat unique among the list of psychological thrillers. There's plenty of suspense, with gloved hands, shadowy figures, and silence. Long camera takes enhance creepy tension as does odd camera angles.

As with most thrillers of this kind, the killer seems to know exactly where to be and when to be there, and that's a genre problem. There are also some story clich√©s, like dependence on television news and the use of computers to convey information to the audience. I did not like the bathroom segments, and Harry Connick Jr. needs to confine his efforts to his great music. The film's climax descends into unrealistic silliness.

Production design is fine. Of note is Helen's elaborate and modern apartment, wherein almost one-third of the film takes place. The score varies appropriately from melancholy to eerie to classical. But I dislike the song ""Murder By Numbers"", mercifully played just once. Casting is credible; acting is above average. Weaver gives a convincing performance, and Holly Hunter is good in every movie I have seen her.

A lot of research went into this film on serial killers. For example, we know that most organized serial killers hide behind a mask of normalcy; and in a couple of early scenes our killer shows up as just another average Joe, undetectable in his apparent sanity.

The story here is a bit contrived. But it draws viewers in with lots of tension and suspense. And with the performances of Weaver and Hunter, the film's imperfections seem less severe."

But alas is that not what makes these once in a while films so special? Obviously director Gilliam is a rare talent, a treasure. But even for him 12 Monkeys outshines nearly everything else he's ever done. (And that says a lot. Brazil after all is another incredible film.) But this movie has two things going for it that ale it rise to the very top of the top. #1 it features a stellar cast who all equally deliver fantastic performances. This is Bruce Willis at his peak -- before he sold out and went all Die Hard, when e still cared about being taken seriously as an actor. Same with Brad Pitt. Many attribute this film as the first time Pitt showed the world that he truly was an actor and not just another pretty face. (He further proved that point in Fight Club and many others through the years -- Money Ball, Tree of Life, et al.) and then there's Madeline Stowe. Besides the stellar acting though 12 Monkeys accomplished something even more important: it gave us the opportunity for future films such as Memento and Inception. 12 Monkeys not only featured a non-linear approach to time travel, it did so erratically boldly dynamically and unapologetically so, allowing future filmmakers, like the aforementioned referenced Nolan brothers, to feel safe stepping even further out on those limbs. 12 Monkeys opened that door and so many others. This is a film you can see over and over and still see something new in it AND be moved by. A classic by all standards."
8,Babe (1995),01-Jan-1995,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[""Children's"", 'Comedy', 'Drama']"," ""Babe"" is a charming, subtle sleeper that's filled with suspense, humor, and genuinely touching drama...in other words, it has all the elements mainstream movies seldom deliver. The fact that the movie's central characters are barnyard animals makes it even more of a fascinating achievement. Examples:

An early scene in which Babe, the orphaned piglet on Hoggett's farm, cries ""I want my mom"" is more emotionally effective than all of the sappy melodrama squeezed into three hours of ""Titanic.""

The scene in which Farmer Hoggett (James Cromwell), despondent over a sick Babe, does an Irish jig to cheer the porker up, is funnier than anything I saw in ""There's Something About Mary.""

And finally, the climactic sequence, in which Babe participates in a sheep-herding competition (reserved for dogs), is more suspenseful and exciting than anything you'll find within ""The Matrix.""

And everything in between these moments is sensational, as well.

9,Dead Man Walking (1995),01-Jan-1995,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," The story of a nun who is assigned to be the spiritual advisor of a man who has only a short time to live before his execution. He has already been on death row for six years. He and another man have been convicted of the brutal murder of a couple out parking in the woods.

The dialogue is fantastic as Sister Helen has meaningful discussions with not only our 'dead man' Matthew Poncelet, but also his family and the families of the victims involved. The film builds in intensity until unleashing a stunning and gripping conclusion that left me deeply moved. It's also an educational piece on the lethal injection process, something most people would have no clue about before viewing this film. Both Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn exhibit phenomenal acting from beginning to end. You can see real emotion in their faces and movements especially towards the end. There's not one moment in the film that feels unnecessary, not one moment in the film that seems contrived. Everything feels real and the direction (from Tim Robbins, who played the main character in The Shawshank Redemption only a year earlier) attests to its greatness.

It's a bit of casting cleverness that Scott Wilson - who played one of the two killers in 1967's ""In Cold Blood"" - is playing a chaplain here.

A couple of points - Matt starts out manipulative with Prejean even trying some pedestrian jail house come on initially, but she lets him know where things stand right off the bat. I wonder if he would have ever taken responsibility for what he did and admitted his crimes to Sister Prejean if he was not about to be executed. Bravado seems to be a big part of his identity. He ultimately admits he would not have been in the woods doing what he did to get to death row if he had the courage to stand up to his crazy companion and just walk away.

And this is the thing about these kinds of cases, the individual is on trial, but often it is two people together each of whom can't back down in the presence of the other who do the most gruesome crimes. It really is the bad company they choose and poor impulse control when free to make those choices that leads to their downfall. Some call it the synergy of evil."
10,Richard III (1995),22-Jan-1996,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"['Drama', 'War']"," Ian McKellen has been one of the most versatile actors for many years. One of his most pronounced roles was in this adaptation of William Shakespeare's ""Richard III"". Taking place in a fictional version of 1930s England, it depicts Richard as a fascist wannabe dictator. His flags and rallies look like something right out of Nazi Germany.

I should admit that I've never read Shakespeare's original play or seen a production thereof - I don't even know that much about the War of the Roses - so this is my introduction to it. The movie has made me eager to see it. Fine support comes from the rest of the cast as assorted relatives, consorts and aides. The movie could be seen as a warning about autocratic leaders, especially as we currently see ascendant authoritarianism around the world. I recommend it.

PS: McKellen later played a Nazi in Bryan Singer's ""Apt Pupil"", while John Wood is best known as Prof. Falken in ""WarGames""."
11,Seven (Se7en) (1995),01-Jan-1995,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"['Crime', 'Thriller']",
12,"Usual Suspects, The (1995)",14-Aug-1995,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"['Crime', 'Thriller']"," The Usual Suspects is two movies in one. Enjoyable the first time you watch it, even more enjoyable the second time round. The first viewing asks questions that are answered in an `I could kick myself' moment in the final few minutes, and the second viewing is interesting because when you know the answers, the film becomes that much clearer. It requires a certain amount of commitment, though. Be warned, if you stop concentrating for a moment then the remaining running time of the movie will be spent trying to figure out how what you missed has lead to what you are now watching.

It concerns the story of five felons brought in by the police for a line-up and how those same felons reluctantly end up working for the mysterious and ghost-like Keyser Soze: a legend among the criminal fraternity, a man who no-one has seen and lived, a man so dangerous that he is thought to be the devil himself.you get the idea. The plot is rather intricate so I shan't bother to explain it here but it does rather make me think that Christopher McQuarrie, the writer, kept going to the office in the morning with yet another complexity to add that he thought up the night before. That's not to say it doesn't work, far from it, but it does leave you reeling from the sheer amount of information and names thrown at you from the offset.

Gabriel Byrne is good, but not flawless, as the tortured Dean Keaton who is torn between his career as a criminal and his forlorn attempt at trying to go straight, but his relationship with uptown lawyer Edie Finneran (Suzy Amis) is badly explored and I never felt it gave motive enough for his actions throughout the movie. Kevin Spacey is wonderful as the crippled Roger 'Verbal' Kint and is effective with the results both cunning and tragic. The real star of the movie, however, is a strangely accented Pete Postlethwaite as Kobayashi, supposedly Keyser Soze's right-hand man. He effortlessly plays a character of terrible coolness and poker-faced efficiency leading the dance that the rest of the characters must follow.

Director Bryan Singer has done well to bring such a momentous and involved screenplay to life and any gripes I may have cannot detract from the fact that the film, as a whole, is much better than the sum of its parts."
13,Mighty Aphrodite (1995),30-Oct-1995,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Comedy']," Sportswriter Lenny Weinrib (Allen) and his wife (Bonham-Carter) adopt a baby from an anonymous mother. After a few years pass, Lenny starts to wonder about the woman. Curiosity quickly gets the better of him, so he steals files from the adoption agency and sets out to find her. Lenny is dismayed, maybe even terrified, to find that Linda (Sorvino,) the mother, is a beautiful $200-an-hour prostitute. So that he can fashion the proper mother-son reunion and save himself from what fate seems to have in store, he determines to 'reform' Linda. Interwoven throughout the story is a Greek chorus (including F. Murray Abraham and Olympia Dukakis,) who add their own unique take on the proceedings.

I've always preferred Woody Allen's comedies over his dramas. This one is probably one of my favorites. This film is a great example of Woody Allen showing no interest in convincing his audience into swallowing down some serious morals. It's light, fluffy, shamelessly sentimental and does not suffer a bit because of it. The plot is generally an uplifting tale of changing ones life for the better, and intertwined with this is some of Woody Allen's best humor. There are many entertaining characters, especially Mira Sorvino's prostitute and Michael Rapaport's dim-witted boxer, Kevin.

The stand-out here is Mira Sorvino. She is absolutely enthralling, with her ditsy nature and confidence masking a timid vulnerability, all of which earned her a well deserved Oscar. Linda could have been an over the top, cartoonish character, Pygmalion on crack. But under the careful direction of Allen, Sorvino gives the best performance of her career so far, and one of the funniest performances ever."
14,"Postino, Il (1994)",01-Jan-1994,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"['Drama', 'Romance']"," For all intents and purposes, this is Massimo Troisi's film and it is tragic and yet, and yes, poetic, that he died a few hours after giving this memorable, multi-layered performance. The waves are welcomed on the shore of tranquil and beautiful Capri as the final scene unwinds. Then a poem simply written on the black screen closes the tale by summarizing and succinctly depicting the essence of the movie, before a dedication is made: ""To our friend Massimo"" This is Troisi's film and he also participated in the fine writing with a simple but heartfelt story and exquisite dialogue. Although Troisi is also a director, this time, it is English director Michael Radford who will put all the pieces together of this timeless story and also contribute to the writing. In a way, this is the beginning of how this project becomes international and goes beyond Italy, both outside and inside the picture (althought all the action actually takes place in Capri, Italy). Argentinian Luis Enr√≠quez Bacalov will win an Oscar for his peaceful, poignant score. I suppose that French Philippe Noiret, from Cinema Paradiso ) fame will need as little directing as Troisi in portraying real life Chilean poet and political activist Pablo Neruda. In the movie you will also hear Spanish and hear about Chile (and Sweeden, Russia, France) as if they are actual characters of the movie.

The screenplay is based on, Chilean writer, Antonio Sk√°rmeta's El cartero novel about Nobel Prize winner Pablo Neruda and a bond he forms with a postman in Isla Negra in Chile. Skarmeta had already adapted his own work for the screen (and directed it); the Spanish-language Ardiente paciencia(1983), which I would love to see eventually. Il Postino transposes the story to Italy where Neruda was given a place to stay in a villa in Capri by Edwin Cerio during his real life exile in 1952.

The tale is simple enough. A young man who does not want to become a fishermen like most men of his hometown decides to be the private postman (for pennies) of popular poet that lives in exile in a near-by villa. Intrigued by this famous figure, he starts to awkwardly ask questions about poetry and a genuine friendship develops between them.

Mario, the postman, is lovestruck by Beautiful Beatrice (Scicilian Maria Grazia Cucinotta) and runs to the man who seemingly woes hundreds of women with words, but her ultra-catholic aunt may end up being a bigger obstacle than his lack of romantic banter. Beyond the typical love story that is more of a backdrop to the tale of friendship is the appreciation for poetry and in art to express the beauty of life. In fact, in a way it is also Pablo Neruda's film. The real life poet who's poetry is used in the movie and who's life inspired the character that is so central to the story, to the small town to Mario's growth as an individual. He who can barely read and write, and says that he wants to be a poet just like his friend and idol. Very inspirational. A true work of art in every aspect. I cannot sincerely think of a bad thing to say about this one."
15,Mr. Holland's Opus (1995),29-Jan-1996,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," It's a MOVIE! I'm reading comments so vastly polarized to one extreme or another so as not to be believed.

Okay, I am a musician. I've been one on a professional level for over ten years, both as a writer and performer. And I LOVED this movie (apologies to all those pretentious 'serious' musicians out there). I enjoyed my theatrical viewing and I have watched my DVD several times.

Is MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS musically accurate? No, of course not, no more so than STAR TREK paying attention to factual science and the laws of physics. But for the most part, nobody other than most of us ego-driven, high horse bound musician types will ever know it.

Designed to have a broad appeal outside the aforementioned musically inclined crowd? Yes, but then so is nearly every movie to come out of Hollywood. It has to be palatable to a certain degree, and I believe that the much maligned ""Play the sunset"" scene is far more entertaining than having Mr. Holland give us lengthy exposition on the proper articulation and technique that goes into playing a given instrument.

And if I hear one more poster scream about Mr. Holland's 'opus' only being ten minutes long (the ""It took him a lifetime to write THIS?"" mantra) I think I'll scream. Did it ever occur to anybody that what we heard was only a small part of a much larger work? Most classical and semi-classical pieces occur in (get ready) MOVEMENTS! It's entirely possible that we only heard the prologue to a much larger piece. Think outside the box, people.

As for the quality of the piece itself, I found it to be acceptable, if not the most dynamic piece of work I've ever heard. But seeing as how we had been hearing snippets of this piece THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE, I can't say that I was so overwhelmingly let down as some of our more 'educated and refined' musician types that have posted here.

Sure, there were some flaws. Ms. Headly is not the greatest actress in the world, and beside Dreyfuss she's downright embarrassing. William Macy's character is so cliched that it warrants no further discussion. The whole subplot with Rowena and her romantic interest in Mr. Holland ran about ten minutes too long. And the ending bit where the arts funding gets cut seemed a little too political.

But overall, a great film, surely one of Dreyfuss' best, and one of my favorite films.

I'm a musician. And I liked it. So sue me...."

OTOH, this is a movie that I would certainly watch again. Partly because I like Juliette Lewis (maybe that will give you a reference point on which to compare my opinion), but also because it's a good ride while it lasts.

Don't go looking for deep meaning where there isn't one, you'll only come out feeling cheated.

19,Antonia's Line (1995),01-Jan-1995,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," ""Antonia's Line"" is one of those movies that's in love with its own quirkiness. This isn't always necessarily bad. Quirky films can be quite delightful when done well. However, in this case, the quirkiness comes at the expense of plot and logic. My sense is that this film's director intended Antonia and her line of female descendants to represent strong, fearless heroines imbued with the fighting feminist spirit. I get this sense because most of the men in this film are brutes, buffoons or a combination of the two, and the women kick butt, make love to each other and tell all of the men off at regular intervals.

This film is insulting to anyone who truly values feminist sensibilities in our movie culture. As so often happens, the makers of this movie equate ""strong"" with callous and emotionally distant. It's hard to care about Antonia and her relations because they all come across as either vacuous or heinous. Antonia's daughter casually chooses a complete stranger to impregnate her because she wants a child but doesn't want to have to deal with the father. Did she ever think that maybe the child would want a father. Is selfishness like this supposed to impress me with its strength of character?

The script meanders from one incident to the next, characters you barely learn anything about appear and drop out of the movie listlessly, and the pacing of the whole thing is limpid. The film is only about 110 minutes long but feels much longer.

I'm tired of the trend of thinking that propagates the belief that in order to be considered strong, women must prove that they can live entirely without men. That's such a juvenile attitude and serves no purpose. Callousness is callousness whether displayed by a man or a woman, and there's nothing weak about leaving yourself vulnerable to the complex relationships that spring between men and women. Of all the life lessons Antonia supposedly passes down to her ancestors, this is the one she forgot to include.

20,Angels and Insects (1995),01-Jan-1995,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"['Drama', 'Romance']"," This was thoroughly engaging and thoughtful film, with a rich and fascinating plot and characters.

The opening scene of the natives of South America dancing is a well edited opening, and the word 'Angels"" appears over it. Indeed, all the Angels in this film are not in England (where the rest of the film takes place). William Adamson (Mark Rylance), a biologist who collects rare insects (especially the butterfly), survives a shipwreck and comes under the protection of an upper class English family. That's where he falls in love with Eugenia (Patsy Kensit). But every family has it's secrets.

Someone described this as ""Merchant-Ivory meets Tennessee Williams"", which is a perfect way to describe this film.

Several have complained about the actors, saying that there is not a single stand-out performance. I disagree, as both Rylance and Kristin Scott Thomas (in a performance worthy of an oscar nomination) acquit themselves well. The script is also very well written, and the costumes deserved the Oscar nomination.

One of the ten best of 1996."

The adaption of this classic story written Robert Louis Stevenson into a Muppet world is, in my opinion, one of the best adaption ever made in the history of Muppet movies.

The movie is quite family friendly, but I can say, as an adult, that I enjoyed it immensely. The humor is never dull, and the numerous musical numbers in this movie makes it a pearl in the world of the Muppets.

I'd just like to point out Tim Curry's role in this movie. Casting him as Long John Silver just adds to the already sky-high quality. With Tim Curry you get both good acting AND good singing.

If you like pirate themed movies, and are not afraid to please your inner child, this movie is most definitely for you!"

Released in the US over a year later than it's initial Hong Kong release, Rumble is a film that Jackie made on his own terms, as compared to his earlier failed attempts at breaking into the US market (i.e. ""Battle Creek Brawl"", ""The Cannonball Run"" ""The Protector""). Those film were all made by American directors and Chan's input and control was limited (""Battle Creek Brawl"" is probably the best of the lot). With Rumble, Jackie shot the film with his Hong Kong crew and had his usual level of control, and it's his mix of a US setting (though actually shot in Vancouver, B.C. as seen by the very unNYC-like mountains in the background) and being able to deliver his amazing fight sequences and jaw-dropping stuntwork along with his endearing comedy that was finally allowed to make it's way to US theaters and won over American audiences, leading to major roles in Hollywood films where he was given more creative control, such as ""Rush Hour"" ""Shanghai Noon"" and ""The Karate Kid"" remake. Rumble sees Jackie playing the nephew of Bronx grocery store owner, Chan stock company actor Bill Tung, who is selling the business to Anita Mui (a real-life pop singer turned actress known as the ""Madonna of Hong Kong""), who's store is plagued by a local street gang. Jackie finds himself at odds with the gang after trying to protect the store as well as protecting the wheelchair bound younger brother of a pretty female gang member, who quickly becomes Jackie's love interest. It's basically ""Death Wish 3"" but with Jackie Chan.Generally speaking, it's a dumb story that's a recycle of I don't know how many 80s Charles Bronson vigilante films and even by those standards the villains are incredibly silly and a ridiculous approximations of what real street gangs are like, but that's not why you watch a Jackie Chan picture. You watch a Jackie Chan movie for the exciting, creative, and acrobatic fight sequences (the best is a knockout sequence in the gang hideout) and for Chan's insane death defying stunts (here he jumps between buildings without a harness and also gets run over by a hovercraft, though it was his leap off a bridge onto the hovercraft that broke his foot, causing him to perform a significant amount of the film in a cast!). Overall, despite some minor tampering by the US distributor, deleting some of the comedy, completely re-dubbing the film, and adding a new soundtrack, ""Rumble in the Bronx"" is one of Chan's better films and is very nearly one of his best (though his best films are ""Drunken Master II"" ""Project A"" ""Dragons Forever"" and ""Police Story"")."
25,"Birdcage, The (1996)",08-Mar-1996,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Comedy']," Not many gay-themed movies get mainstream releases (because they're generally boring and predictable) but thanks to a stellar cast and a truly funny script, 'The Birdcage' certainly got what it deserved.

I generally don't enjoy gay-themed movies for their predictability - or comedies for that matter - but I absolutely loved 'The Birdcage'. Robin Williams stars as cabaret club owner Armand, who - together with his life partner Albert (excellently portrayed by Nathan Lane) - live a flamboyant lifestyle. When Armand's son, Val (Dan Futterman) is about to get married to a conservative senator's daughter, though, their lives are about to change - with hilarious consequences!

'The Birdcage' is laugh-out-loud funny - thanks also to the brilliant cast. Nathan Lane and Hank Azaria (as their houseboy Agador) are hysterical!! And Robin Williams is a feast for the eyes with that hairy chest, which he loves flaunting to absolutely no complaints from my side!

I loved the characters, the premise, the script, the fantastic performances, and the set design. This is undoubtedly one of my favourite gay-themed movies, as well as one of my favourite comedies. It's absolutely fabulous, darling!!"
26,"Brothers McMullen, The (1995)",01-Jan-1995,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Comedy']," I don't really ask that much from a movie..just keep my interest, give me a reason to keep watching. I kept watching this but I don't know why. I was waiting for something to happen, something to show me that the TV Guide calling this 'charming' is justified.

Edward Burns must have family that work for TV Guide.

This movie is all the same thing...all just talk, talk, talk, and almost all of it is strikingly the SAME tone. Its like looking at one color for 90 minutes. Every single conversation starts out the same way and the same issues are discussed over and over and over. I was wishing for a drunk friend, a stoner down the street, SOMETHING to give this some life, because you only see the same seven people in the movie. No one seems to have any friends or do anything but examine their feelings. And no new ground in living in the world is ever covered..you've heard it all before, and by better actors, too.

This is topped by a faux-Hollywood ending, the main couple kissing in the middle of the street as cabs go by..hey, anything to get the damn thing over with, but it reeks of desparation.

27,Bad Boys (1995),01-Jan-1995,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Action']," The first instalment of the Bad Boys franchise served its purpose well, meaning it did what it was suppose to do. The score establish Michael Bay as more than a music video director, it proved black leads could spew on the fence jokes about society and still deliver at the box office and most importantly, in my opinion, catapult Will Smith into the realm of being a superstar.

In all senses of the word the movie is a Hollywood classic, with grown folks alone present it would be the perfect movie to play at a family gathering. It has action, a love interest and laughs to go around at every turn. The chemistry between Martin and Will makes this movie stand out among Hollywood's well established duo action films. Always compared to that of Rush Hour.

In terms of acting there were no horrendous performances, however, Will's portrayal of his character was not completely believable. At times it seemed a bit forced, as if attempting to be this hard stone playboy, then again it was his introduction to the big stage and with that perspective in mind, he did really well in regards to his prior experience.

The only issue with this film for me was the film editing it did not feel cohesive enough, certain shots felt out of place and therefore made the quality of the film seem cheap. It is my belief this and a few other political ambitions and perspectives at that time in the 90's prevented it from being critically acclaimed.

The crazy thing is that for me, aside from the comedy, the music and sound mixing was my favourite part of the movie. Partially biased to my Jamaican culture perhaps but the sound track and the sound editing on this film was phenomenal, then again Bay had done plenty music videos before he tried his hand in film so there is that.

I also forgot to mention Martin did really well in his roll, his character protryal was believable in the sense that he really embodied that role.

With all of this in mind I believe this film warrants a 6/10. Thank you for your time and I hope Bay's films continue to garner success."

It is difficult to see how this could have been done any better - a genuinely thrilling story that encompasses the very best in humanity.

The casting is perfect - everyone puts their heart into it (Ed Harris is especially worth a mention), and the special effects are not only an incredible achievement in themselves, but also used just the way they should be - to tell the story, not replace it. The Zero-G is brilliantly executed, and the CGI Saturn5 on the launch pad is utterly convincing.

Regardless of the fact that we all know the outcome to the story before we start viewing, this is compelling edge of the seat stuff. Howard manages to convey the desperation of the situation, while never once leaving us without hope.

This film is just sheer class from beginning to end. You will love it even if you think you aren't interested in space exploration."

This psychodrama seems a little dated viewed today, and would be an ordinary film except for the fact that it stars the legendary French beauty Catherine Deneuve and is directed by the incomparable Spaniard Luis Bu√±uel, although this is not his best work. The quasi-Freudian exploration of the character of a woman who can only be sexually aroused and satisfied by being treated as trash doesn't exactly play in today's world, nor would it appear on Ms. Magazine's most admired list.

Deneuve demands the screen and is fascinating to watch, and Bu√±uel's direction, while not flashy or completely intelligible, is intriguing and focused. Bu√±uel has done some great work including two I recall, ""The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie"" (1972) and ""That Obscure Object of Desire"" (1977). His early work goes back to the silent film era. My favorite Deneuve film is ""Mississippi Mermaid"" (1969) followed closely by ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg"" (1964).

Deneuve is your high class, slightly cool beauty, somewhat in the manner of Grace Kelly. She looks like butter wouldn't melt in her mouth and so directors have always tried to sully her up. Bu√±uel smears her both literally and figuratively here as a day-tripping prostitute addicted to debasement. I don't buy the psychology, but this sort of thing used to play well. I recall an Italian movie from the same period in which the hero couldn't perform with his sweet and beautiful wife, but had to go slumming to get it on. I think it was called ""Bell Antonio"" or something like that."

Here's my breakdown:

STORY: This is a very poor attempt to meld two very good stories: ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" (1935 and 1962)* and ""Run Silent, Run Deep"" (1958), both of which are excellent films. This is simply modern tripe (tripe can be both meat or something useless, which is why I call these types of films all meat, no nutrients).

It has scant ""character development"" and it's ""story"" is hollow ... yes, like a sub. There's endless male choral / epic-sounding music, and proficient use of the ""f"" bomb, but that's it. Endless music is a near-guarantee that a film lacks substance, even among the classics I love so much.

* Note: Both are excellent and very well acted. The question is do you prefer Gable or Brando?

ACTING: You'd expect solid acting from Washington and Hackman, and they deliver. But that's all you get.

Neither is giving us anything new in range of character quality, just the same personalities in different costumes.

ENTERTAINMENT: For males who want constant tension and testosterone, this is for you. Otherwise, value is low.

TEMPO: OK, I suppose

CINEMATOGRAPHY: It's the inside of a submarine ...

DIRECTING / WRITING: Director: Tony and brother Ridley (not on this film) churn out the same male-oriented drivel, over and over ... ad nausea. On a rare occasion one of them delivers something interesting, e.g. ""Enemy of the State"" (1998), ""Alien"" (1979), ""Black Hawk Down"" (2001). Between them, Ridley appears the far more capable. But as a whole, the cache of their work is fairly predictable and is confined to a sliver of genre.

Writers: Both writers have very small portfolios, and there's not much in those to speak of, if at all.

Is it a good film? Yes, and no

Should you watch this once? Maybe

32,Crumb (1994),01-Jan-1994,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Documentary']," Roger Ebert gave ""Crumb"" four stars, so we rented it. According to his review, the filmmaker, Terry Zwigoff, has known Robert Crumb for many years, and was as depressed and suicidal during the making of the film as Robert Crumb has been at times in his life.

Robert Crumb is a true, tortured eccentric, who found salvation in his art; the fact that he also found fame is almost secondary. By contrast, his brothers, Charles and Max, are basket cases. They were the children of an active monster (their father) and a passive, colluding monster (their mother). There were two sisters, who declined to participate in this film. As Mad Magazine was of the Fifties, so Zap Comics and Robert Crumb's cartoons and artwork were subversive, anarchic emblems of the psychedelic Sixties, although as the film abundantly details, he himself was never really of that world.

After half an hour of this film, we were saying, ""Wow, how fascinating!"" After an hour, we were saying, ""Okay, I've seen enough of Charles and Max."" After an hour and a half, we were pleading, ""Have mercy!"" By the end of this two-hour film, we were feeling as if we'd been tortured by burial under heavy rocks. We came to the end with great relief.

I instinctively understand Robert Crumb, but two hours of Crumb's profound cynicism, his indefatigable negativity, his misanthropy and misogyny, his interminable kvetching---not to mention the ramblings of his brothers and various friends, former lovers and associates---is about an hour too long. A skillful editor could take this material and cut it down to a one-hour special for cable that would be a masterpiece. As it is, it drags on and on and on and on and on and on. Too much of anything, even Robert Crumb, is too much."

It had better lighting, sound, picture, script, actors, etc. ""Desperado"" joins movies such as ""Godfather II,"" ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" ""T2,"" and ""Robocop 2"" just to name a few sequels better than their predecessors.

The no-named Mariachi player is now being played by Antonio Banderas. He is after Bucho (Joaquim de Almeida), the big boss who was pulling the strings when his old flame was killed. He will go from town to town and bar to bar leaving a trail of dead bodies in order to find Bucho.

Helping him is his friend played by Steve Buscemi. Also helping him is his new flame, Carolina (Salma Hayek). Like I said, upgrades all around.

This is a shoot 'em up action flick with a Mexican flare. It's somewhat of a throwback to Spaghetti Westerns, yet in modern day. Looking purely at body count and bullet count, this movie could be virtually indistinguishable from your typical Hollywood action movie. But, just the subtle change of location, accents, and substituting white faces for brown faces and suddenly the new packaging makes the entire product better."

I stand by this statement very strongly, for this is the third film I have watched by ""director"" Greg Araki - ""The Living End"" and ""Nowhere"" being the others. Araki has made an offensive, horrendously written (dialogue example: ""Shut up hamburger face!""), poorly directed film in ""The Doom Generation."" It's one of those pictures that knows it's trying to be cool and wants the younger, angst-ridden generation it attempts to portray to buy into such low-rate shock value(Example: Each time the characters enter a convenience store, someone is killed.). Each of the three leads in the film are completely unlikable and poorly acted and they know it - note the terrible over-acting by James Duval. The word ""subliminal"" is something Araki needs to look up as he douses his composition with such over-the-top ""symbolism"" - Every time they order something at the convenience store the price comes to $6.66. Get it? Ho-hum. It's enough to make one puke. Araki has absolutely no respect or passion for his craft and even less for his audience. In a Premiere magazine interview, when asked what advice he would give to young, aspiring filmmakers he responded, ""Don't do it."" He acts as if to offend his audience is a chore when it is obvious that he wants so desperately to get a rise out of us with such cheap shock-value. All of this is offensive, low-rate drivel. It wants the teen generation to think that they are doomed and to immerse themselves in such fake, melo-dramatic angst. This is a film that wants to give kids an excuse to shoot their classmates. It creates problems that never existed in the first place by romanticizing the alienated attitudes of many teens. This is Araki's only mission in ""The Doom Generation."" It can be seen just as clear in the aforementioned ""The Living End"" and ""Nowhere."" The film is a mess from start to finish, a total hack job. Greg Araki is the an entire level below fimmakers like Ed Wood, who at least had passion for the crap he produced. Hope Araki sleeps well at night. Or let's hope he stops making films... forever."
35,Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home (1995),01-Jan-1995,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['Adventure', ""Children's"", 'Drama']"," I didn't loved FREE WILLY but still like it very much and consider it a childhood classic thanks to the many times it was overplayed on channel 6 during my childhood. The sequels were aired often during my childhood but strictly in that period because in fact I didn't remembered them that much and last March I finally re-watched the first of these sequels. After 15 years (saw it the first time in 2009) I found it slightly inferior to the original but still not that bad as some of the reviewers say.

After Willy jumped for freedom at the end of the first one the Greenwoods (Michael Madsen and Jayne Atkinson) are planning a vacation in San Juan for camping and visiting Randolph (August Schellenberg) but before that Dwight Mercer (Mykelti Williamson) arrives with the news that Jesse's mom was found dead in New York and left another son. Jesse's step-brother Elvis (Francis Capra) is very loquacios and troublesome and grates on Jesse's nerves. Once in San Juan, Jesse reunites with Randolph and go to see Willy and his orca family.

Soon after oil tanker Dakar has an accident and loses oil thanks to a malfunction in the engine trapping Willy and his family in the process. Luna ends on the beach and the Greenwoods manage to return her to water and the Benbrook Oil CEO John Milner (Jon Tenney) promise to help the whales go in another zone. Elvis, that escaped because Annie didn't respected her promise, in a bar hears from afar a conversation between Milner and Bill Wilcox (M. Emmet Walsh) that their real plan is to sell the whales to zoos and so he rushes to the camp for warning Jesse and Glen. After throwing Milner and Wilcox in the water they manage to save the whales after also surviving a fire caused by the oil, and in this occasion Willy will take Jesse on the ground so that the parents can retrieve him. Some time later, Elvis makes amends to Jesse saying that his mum talked well about him and she was sorry for everything, and this convinces Jesse to have Elvis as his step-brother. Soon before the end credits, we see the orca family of Willy, Luna and Catspaw swimming together.

The plot doesn't look bad and I loved the settings. But what prevented me to give a higher score was the major annoyance of Elvis. He was so loquacious, so annoying and so whiny that I really couldn't stand him and if it wasn't for the other actors' performances and the happy ending I would have given this a 3 because of him. I would have preferred that when Elvis accidentally fell in the water Willy should have left him there, he was THAT annoying! I would say more but IMDB won't allow it.

As for the rest of the cast, they were all good (Madsen, Williamson, Schellenberg, Tenney, Al Sapienza, John Considine and the late Walsh) with the material given. And the moments before the end with the helicopter trying to rescue the kids looked like something picked straight from the DIE-HARDs and considering that this is a family movie, it's fitting since the first DIE-HARD is considered an unintentional Christmas movie.

Overall, not a terrible sequel nor family movie (and trust me, I have seen much MUCH worse) but one that could have been much better if it wasn't for the major annoyance of the step-brother. But if you like or love the first one, this would please you in a similar manner."
36,Mad Love (1995),01-Jan-1995,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"['Drama', 'Romance']",
37,Nadja (1994),01-Jan-1994,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," In New York City Nadja, her brother and their slave come to terms with the murder of their father by Van Helsing. Meanwhile the girlfriend of Helsing's nephew, Jim, is taken as a drone by Nadja. Jim and Van Helsing set out to stop the reign of the Dracula family and stop their blood lust.

I didn't even know this was about the Dracula legend when I sat to watch it, just the title drew me and the cast sounded quite promising. The black and white, shaky shots, post modern slant and grainy camera work were both a draw and a turn off for me. On one hand it was very arty, deliberately sticking a finger up to the mainstream. I dislike this feeling - one that the multiplex crowd are unworthy of any film and that the director wouldn't care to have their film be successful and hence uses such things with abandon. However it also made the film much more imaginative and interesting if it had all been full Technicolor with steadicam and nicely framed shots, it was pretty hip and I enjoyed it even if I felt like it was aimed at the art crowd rather than just being a film for anyone or everyone.

The story is quite good, albeit just a twist on the old story of Dracula. The script is where the main difference lies. It is quite talky a film but it is better for it. The dialogue is a little pretentious at times but it is interesting and involving. In terms of characters I'm afraid it falls down quite badly - the grainy images and dialogue that is far from `down to earth' stop the characters from ever being real people or even characters that I felt deeply involved in - but happily it wasn't to the point that I was completely disinterested in them. That's not to say it was great - but it was different enough to keep me interested, even if I wasn't gripped by it at any point. Likewise with the direction, I felt there was imagination but that it went too far to the point of just being experimental and arty for the sake of it. If you are making a film with as good a cast as this had then why on earth would you use a child's camera unless you were trying to be arty? This mindset did feel through the whole film and it was, as I've already said, a pretty big turn off for me.

The cast is great on paper but they struggle with the pretentious dialogue and the fact that the film loses them in a grainy black & white world. I will always watch Donovan but that doesn't mean he's any good. Here he is alright but has precious little to actually do! Fonda is better and plays his character with a sense of humour that the wider film could well have benefited from - I wonder if the director got annoyed by Fonda not playing it straight when he clearly had arty aspirations. Lowensohn is not only beautiful but acts well in the title role but the astonishingly named Galaxy Craze was pretty much cardboard as Lucy.

Overall this is an interesting movie but it struggles under the weight of it's own pretensions. I found it to be different enough visually and script-wise to be interesting and even I found the apparent concerted effort to alienate the mainstream to be slightly off putting. An interesting effort but one that will irritate far more viewers than it will please."
38,"Net, The (1995)",01-Jan-1995,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,"['Sci-Fi', 'Thriller']"," Floppy disks? Dial up modems? To name just a couple of things. I suppose one of the problems of making movies that in any way revolve around technology is that technology evolves, and what seems cutting edge can quickly start to seem old fashioned. That's certainly the case with ""The Net."" Sandra Bullock did a passable job as Angela Bennett - a computer analyst of some sort who basically lives on ""The Net."" She works from home; she never interacts with anyone apparently except through computers. The only exception seems to be her mother, but her mother has Alzheimer's and doesn't know who she is. In 1995 the chat rooms and ""the best pizza in cyberspace"" and sending ""electronic mail"" probably would have seemed cutting edge to a lot of people. Less than 20 years later (and actually long before this) it's just really, really dated technology with rather grainy computer graphics - along with the aforementioned floppy disks and dial up modems. At times it's hard to get around that and settle into this movie.

And yet, at the same time, there's a strangely prophetic feel to this as well. I mean, in 1995 somebody made a movie that revolved exclusively around issues of identity theft and cyberterrorism - both very real concerns 20 years later. Not a bad job of gazing into the crystal ball, I'd say.

Angela gets caught up in a conspiracy by a group that seems to be trying to crash pretty much every computer system going. I have to admit that the plot came across at times as a bit convoluted. I wasn't entirely clear on the goals of the cyberterrorists; what they were hoping to accomplish. But they certainly did a good job of messing with Angela's life. While on vacation she meets and falls for a mysterious man who's part of the conspiracy. The conspirators then stole her identity and gave it to one of their own; they replaced her identity with that of a woman wanted by the police for a series of felonies. Basically her entire life was wiped out and replaced by a life she knew nothing about and that put her on the run, with nowhere to go for help. That was well done, and pretty smart. Her goal, of course, is to reveal the plot and regain her life.

There's some good action; and some rather clich√© ""chase"" scenes involved. It stretches the bounds of credibility a bit, I think, by suggesting that there's hardly a person in the entire world who could vouch for who Angela really is. She's honestly had no contact with anyone? She spends every moment of every day in her apartment on a computer? If so, why did she go on vacation in the first place? Clearly she likes getting out. And her mother was in some sort of institution, and Angela clearly visited. Maybe her mother doesn't know her, but wouldn't some staff member of the institution know who she was? And wouldn't the company that sends her the ""best pizza in cyberspace"" have to have someone deliver it to her? There must have been someone who had seen her.

So, credibility's lacking a little bit, and this does have a bit of a quaint, old-fashioned feel to it. But Bullock is OK, and there's enough excitement in this to keep you watching. (6/10)"
39,Strange Days (1995),01-Jan-1995,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"['Action', 'Crime', 'Sci-Fi']"," I guess James Cameron made action films better for all of us. Not just for the audience, but for the actors and the people involved in the movies too. He even smashed the gender barrier in the world of action movies and gave us the toughest females ever (Sarah Connor, Ellen Ripley, Helen Tasker, and Lindsay Brigman). And in 1995 he wrote up a screenplay that had a really fascinating story about the impending millennium and he called it ""Strange Days"". But instead of directing it, he decided to hand over the directing duties to his ex-wife Katheryn Bigelow, who made ""Point Break"" a few years before. And I've gotta say, women have really earned their place in action cinema, and we owe it to good ol' James Cameron.

Strange Days tells the story taking place at the turn of the millennium from the 1000's to the 2000's and from 1999 to 2000. And due to the fact that it's a science fiction film, it features an outlawed device called SQUID that people can use with inserted discs to see, feel and experience an event that someone else already recorded. And a former cop named Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes) who is now a hustler and seller of this device frequently uses the thing that he devotes his life to in order to experience the old memories of his ex-wife. And two other sub-plots emerge when he gets a disc that reveals corruption in the LAPD and another that shows a serial killer stalking, raping and murdering women. And it all finally converges at the end.

Two years after playing the heartless Nazi Amon Goeth in ""Schindler's List"", Ralph Fiennes shows a completely different side of him in here. His character Lenny Nero is basically a vulnerable, weak guy who happens to be a lying, deceiving and vain hustler and due to his occasional silliness, it's almost impossible to see the negative aspects of his personality. He's also quite stubborn and a fool for love since his ex-wife chose fortune and fame over him. And Fiennes was perfectly cast here due to his skill of conveying several personality traits into a character. Also, his character is somewhat unique since he isn't really as macho and he seems to be more feminine due to his clothing style of silk and spandex. And we all know we can't keep ripping-off other movie characters to be make a profit, and ""Strange Days"" does the opposite. It does what it should do to get originality.

My favorite acting performance in here was, without a doubt, Angela Basset as Mace. We all know that James Cameron constantly puts tough female characters in his films, but Mace in ""Strange Days"" takes the cake! She serves as Lenny's bodyguard and provides a couple cool fight scenes. Mace used to be an average woman and then her husband got arrested and when he started doing time, Mace completely changed and became more masculine, kinda like Sarah Connor between the first two Terminator movies.

Tom Sizemore, who is a Bigelow regular, is great as Lenny's best pal and Juliette Lewis is great as Nero's ex-wife and she provides a realistic portrayal as the hot woman who wants nothing but money and could care less for morality and love. She also does some great singing in a couple scenes when she's performing with her band. And the dirty cop Steckler played by Vincent D'Onofrio before his Law and Order days, is played flawlessly and he's a pretty scary guy and he's willing to do anything to cover up what he and his partner did (although I'm not gonna tell exactly what in this review, you'll have to watch and find out).

""Strange Days"" has got it all; action, science fiction, suspense, and romance. The SQUID things were really something cool, original and creative, and it would be even better if it was really invented someday. This isn't really as action-packed as James Cameron's movies tend to be like, since it's got a different director, but the vision of Los Angeles is just remarkable, there's arson fires and riots packed in almost every scene and its just horrifying. Even though it hasn't happened yet, it makes you think and it makes you worry, especially if you're foolish enough to be living in LA.

And remember, a woman actually made one of the greatest action adventures of all time. Katheryn Bigelow, we salute you."
40,"To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar (1995)",01-Jan-1995,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Comedy']," On the plus side, this film has a wonderful cameo by Robin Williams and Patrick Swayze proves he could successfully step into the lead role of any regional production of ""Auntie Mame."" After that, one can pick this film apart piece by piece.

But here are a few of the film's major problems: 1) Drag queens do not dress in drag 24/7. And certainly they do not sleep in drag. Drag is a costume, something worn as part of a show, an alternate identity. In fact the film would have been more interesting if we had got to know the characters in their everyday life as a contrast to their drag identities. But placing the guys in drag and keeping them there keeps them safely in the realm of a sight gag. The characters are not people, they are extented jokes.

2) This is a film about how gay men make the world nice for heterosexual lovers. This would have been truly ground-breaking if it had been about the romantic lives of this trio, not just portraying them, literally, as fairy godmothers who come to work romantic magic for straights. 3) The film is sexist. The trio come to this small town and teach men how to show respect by beating them up and solve all the women's problems by giving them self-esteem inducing makeovers. Men are villains and get violence; women are victims and get pampering. And, of course, gays earn the right to be ""fabulous."" Wouldn't it be interesting if someone made a film where women are taught to respect men and men were pampered their way to self-esteem? That'll never happen.

Sadly, ""Wong Foo"" truly thinks it is being bold and original, but every step of the way it falls back on clich√©s and tiresome stereotypes."
41,Billy Madison (1995),01-Jan-1995,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Comedy']," This was on TV last night, and I watched it on the strength of the reviews here at imdb.com. I am AMAZED that so many people liked this pustulent, fetid, rancid discharge of a film. Its lack of comedy is only equalled by its immaturity and pointlessness. There is no acting, no humour, and a plot so thin I can only wonder how it survives holding the weight of its own rancid patheticness. I was literally slack jawed with shock at how bad this film is. I was frustrated with sorrow for the people who actually liked this - one reviewer says that he / she was laughing out loud. At what? How films like this ever get released? How Adam Sandler still has a career after this moronic turd of a film? Just awful. Dont say I did not warn you. By the way, this is only the 2nd review I have written on imdb.com. Generally I feel little need to, as previous posters sum up (generally) the pros and cons of a film very well, but I feel in this case, the public should be warned. I cannot BELIEVE there are so many good reviews for this film, and the truth needs to be told. I am actually offended that this rubbish got greenlighted, made and released, where actual (would be) decent films never see production.

Shocking."
42,Clerks (1994),01-Jan-1994,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Comedy']," Rarely is a script so clearly the star of a movie, but ""Clerks"" is clearly a product of the unique mind behind it, Kevin Smith. This is a filmmaking debut with a clear idea of what it wants to say and how it wants to say it, namely in the form of casual conversation that ranges from profane to profound.

The vessels by which these thoughts and ideas are delivered go by the names of Dante (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson), 22-year-old New Jersey convenience and video store clerks, respectively, who are pals despite drastically different attitudes toward their ""dead-end"" jobs. The film predominantly follows Dante over the course of a day at the Quick Stop, a day that he was never supposed to work in the first place. In addition to persistent stop- ins from Randal, he is visited by/chats with his girlfriend, Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti), grapples with the news about of a couple other ex-girlfriends and deals with a host of unusual customers, not to mention the shady characters who hang out outside the store including Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith).

""Clerks"" plays out as ""scenes at a convenience store"" for the majority of its runtime to the point that it could've been a play and almost worked just as well. Film, however, feels more fitting; there's something about the context of this actual dinky convenience store location and the way Smith carefully selects his shot angles in each scene (shot in black and white) that brings everything together. The ""theater"" would betray the down-to-earth New Jersey reality of it all, even though so much of the film centers on dialogue.

What Smith is able to convey in a series of conversations, most filmmakers have to construct elaborate scenes in order to communicate. He can take a conversation about blowjobs or something even more inane and turn it into something much bigger. That's a hell of a skill. The only pitfall is that none of the actors can reel in the cleverness and timing of Smith's words. In some scenes the acting sort of just dissipates leaving only dialogue ‚Äì these poor actors have to make these quip-filled exchanges sound like natural banter between minimally educated middle-class slackers.

Nevertheless, the script carries ""Clerks"" to the notoriety Smith has earned over the last couple decades. It's an entertaining tennis match of dialogue that's sharp, occasionally satirical and most importantly, taps into the core of what young people struggling to do something with their lives all feel. And he doesn't just go there with the conversations; he illustrates it in the various seemingly mundane dilemmas and conflicts Dante encounters through the course of his day.

Maybe most significantly of all, Smith speaks for the outcast in ""Clerks."" He speaks for the guy living in his parents' basement, the guy working a convenience store job, the guy who spends his days loitering outside convenience stores or playing street hockey and other characters society frowns upon for not ""doing anything with their lives."" He points out that despite their disregard for societal protocols, they still have smart things to say and above all, like ""the rest of us,"" still yearn for meaning in their lives.

43,Disclosure (1994),01-Jan-1994,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"['Drama', 'Thriller']"," 1994's Disclosure shows viewers to a subject and issue that is coming more and more common in the workforce and society that is sexual harassment. You have Michael Douglas as a computer executive Tom Sanders, who rejects the advanced passion of his new boss an old-flame played perfect by the hot and sexy Demi Moore. Only to find out later that his whole life and career is on the line when he's accused of sexual harassment, the tables are turned only as he later finds out this is all a game of company conspiracy and sexual politics, the Sanders character is one you cheer for to win his lawsuit and career. I'm thankful for Barry Levinson and Michael Crichton who show with this film that sexual harassment can come from a female instead of a male. Men are sometimes wrongly stereotyped as the predators instead of the prey, and that many women in the workforce have ego problems and power trips just like the Moore character. Disclosure is a good movie not a great movie that shows women can be just as guilty as men with issues like sexual harassment, and remember be careful and stay away from a female with a little bit of given power."

There is some shocking violence in this movie, but it's not the main thing. If you're looking for action look somewhere else. If you're looking for a great drama with a wonderful cast then this is your movie.

I just loved it! Stephen King is a master of story-telling as the past and present unfold in front of our eyes and we get one piece of the puzzle at the time up to the great climax at the end.

Taylor Hackford also did a great job directing this movie. There are some really cool visual effects quite similar to what Hackford did later in ""Devil's Advocate"" two years later."
45,Eat Drink Man Woman (1994),01-Jan-1994,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['Comedy', 'Drama']"," To make the long story short, in this movie is shown the cycle of life: youth, maturity, old age, and how interact between them, with its ups and downs. Family, love, agreements, disagreements, relationships, friendship, birth and death.

  Despite the generational gaps, there is a common ground: the art of cooking, which appears as the silent and dispassionate observer which brings people and families together, and around which the life cycle unfolds.

Quite apart from this, i am an Asian food lover and this movie was a torture since i saw it with my empty stomach. Cooked meals depicted in the film are the epitome of culinary delight. One can do nothing but feeling irresistibly tempted by this festival of colors and flavors.

Probably they had hired traditional Chinese/Taiwanese food professional cooks.

Having said that, I turn off my computer, and go to dinner to a Korean restaurant next door to my place. : )

46,Exotica (1994),01-Jan-1994,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," Atom Egoyan's ""Exotica"" is perhaps the most perfect and beautifully intricate film I have seen. Filmed on a $2 million Canadian budget with his mostly usual staple of actors it explores territory usually left unchartered in the film world.

Francis Brown (Bruce Greenwood) is a tax auditor for Revenue Canada who makes nightly visits to Exotica, a local gentleman's club, where he also asks for his favorite dancer, Christina (Mia Kirschner). The activity of the club is told to us by Eric, the D.J. (Elias Koteas)who makes suggestive comments about the dancers. The club is owned by the pregnant Zoe (Arsinee Khanjian; Egoyan's wife). The other main character of the story is Thomas Pinto (Don McKellar), a latently gay pet shop owner being audited by Francis.

The film is largely about replacements and rituals. Eric used to be Christina's lover and relives the relationship through MCing suggestive fantasies of her. The club used to be owned by Zoe's mother and she is taking her mother's place since it's easier than creating her own options. Francis has his niece (Sarah Polley) babysit while he's gone, even though there's no baby to sit and pays her $20 a night and pays Christina $5 a dance. Thomas goes to the opera on a regular basis and scalps tickets in order to meet up with other men. The film doesn't truly come together until the conclusion where everything makes sense.

This film features some great performances, especially Bruce Greenwood as the troubled and intense Francis. Elias Koteas is equally good as the jealous DJ. This is a sorely underrated film with the essentials of a masterpiece. The score is also excellent and I highly recommend the soundtrack as well.

Overall, one of my all-time favorite films. A must-see."

Even though branded as ""the worst director of all time,"" Wood was refreshingly passionate about what he did. Of course, I can't really judge his work, but from what I saw in this movie I'm pretty sure that the critics are right about him.

But that's not the point of Ed Wood. Not at all. My favorite scene in the whole movie is the conversation between Wood and Orson Welles. One perhaps the best filmmaker of his time, the other a young, struggling filmmaker without experience or talent, but each knows what the other is going through. They have the same problems and the same ambitions. The fact that one is a genius and the other a total failure is only secondary.

The performances are all first-rate, starting with Depp and Landau and going all the way to the supporting cast which includes a great performance by Bill Murray. Opposing Ed Wood's statement that ""filmmaking is not about the tiny details,"" Tim Burton gave us another great film filled with wonderful details.

The film does not go into detail about Wood's experiences prior to and after making his first films which is understandable when you make a little research on this very website.

This film made me curious about Ed Wood's work and maybe I'll get over myself and check out Plan 9 from Outer Space or Glen or Glenda.

48,Hoop Dreams (1994),01-Jan-1994,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Documentary']," I'll never understand the USA's obsession with high school sports. Putting this much pressure on 14-18 year old kids and calling them athletes and referring to their basketball as a 'career' is harmful. Sure, it's an entertaining game but that's all it is. Once business takes over all bets are off and lives are ruined. The promise of the American dream of wealth and success is nothing but a bald-faced lie. These topics were briefly touched on but for the most part the movie was a rather passive documentary that simply chronicled two different boys' lives in high school basketball for four years. That in itself was interesting enough for me to give this movie a good rating. The people are compelling and it was good to know that eventually at least one of the boys came to realize that his NBA dreams were unrealistic. The movie still presents a powerful portrayal of the lower-class inner city blacks in America and the desperation they have to endure. One of the only outs for their kids seems to be sports scholarships. Enter the over-zealous coach, competitive scouts and legions of fans. It's interesting to see because no one in Canada is as obsessed with high school sports. I think it's mainly because it's the only way out for poor, inner-city blacks in America. The concept makes for an entertaining, emotional documentary."

In that department I was disappointed, it's basically a narrow love story that is clich√© and very formulaic. The constant emotional or dramatic music that plays in almost every scene starts to get annoying after a while as well. The main highlight of this film is the young Brad Pitt and the makers of this movie knows this as well, and not because his character stood out or anything. But because it's the type of movie where the handsome man rides in with his horse and gets the female audiences to drool. The movie is basically about three brothers falling for the same girl and all the drama that goes with it. The story is also very slow moving and gets tedious after a while, I enjoy some romance movie but I can't really say I really enjoyed this one all that much. The pacing is awkward like some scenes were cut due to length, so I assume the book to probably be better. Some critics claim this movie is poetic, but I just found it mostly corny.

By now, most sophisticated movie-goers are aware that King George III's sickness might very well have been a result of porphyria, a hereditary disease that some doctors have traced back to Mary, Queen of Scots (i.e., George III's great-great-great-great-great grandmother). Whatever the cause, Nigel Hawthorne gives the performance of a lifetime as the tortured king. The conflict between George III and his heir, the Prince of Wales (the eventual King George IV), is brutally and unapologetically portrayed: the director does not spare us in his vivid reenactment of the combative and sour relationship that actually existed between the two men. As an American, one might suspect I'd be unsympathetic to the British monarch who presided over England's attempt to brutalize its colonies -- but George III's almost-wistful resentment of his errant ""colonists"" generates some sympathy for the man himself - a sympathy which is unexpectedly intensified by Hawthorne's sudden descent into incoherence, his dim, yet aching realization of what he has become, and his eventual recovery. George III was haunted by demons not of his own making; and no human being deserves the fate to which his disease, if such it was, eventually condemned him. ""The Madness of King George"" enlightened, entertained,and provoked: what more could one ask of a film?"

It's not that I mind extreme violence. I'm a giant fan of Tarantino, and his script on the movie is obviously intelligent and witty. When it comes to the script, this movie is absolutely fine. But when it comes to the directing...

I don't know what happened to Stone when he directed it. Maybe he was half-asleep, in a bad mood or just was tempted by the devil. But anyway, this movie has been turned by his inept direction into a juggernaut. A sinking juggernaut.

The switches of color to black and white, the insane delusions, the below average soundtrack, the twisted colors, the worst joke ever in a movie - the absolutely stupid sitcom spoof, which is dumber then ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"", which does make you crack in laughter - but because you are laughing at the director's stupidity.

Once again, Stone is a great director. But I don't know what happened to him.

P.S. If Tarantino would have directed it, it would surely be a masterpiece. I ranked it 6 because of the great script and solid performances."

My inner critic informed me that it was just more Hollywood pap purpose built for the guileless and those less discerning. I should listen to my inner critic more¬Ö Sam Daniels (Dustin Hoffman), Casey (Kevin Spacey) and Saul (Cuba Gooding Jr) are a team of highly trained (and Oscar winning) army scientists. When they identify that an extremely lethal and highly contagious virus known as the Motaba strain has somehow made it to the continental United States they immediately relay news of the threat up the line of management. Only it seems that for some reason the powers that be ‚Äì among whose numbers are Billy (Morgan Freeman) and McClintock (Donald Sutherland) ‚Äì ain't listening, despite all the evidence, scientific graphs, diagrams and powerpoint charts that practically demand to the audience that they should.

By the way all of the above have perfectly legitimate army ranks, but in a film this silly I like to refer to them as Sam, Billy and co¬Ö Sam thinks that this new virus is reeeeeelllll bad, he tells his ex Robbie (Rene Russo), who is now a civilian scientist. Robbie initially ignores him just as Billy did, but when some gooey, pus-filled evidence oozes his way into her view she becomes more sympathetic to his claims, yet even with the mounting body count Billy and his superiors stubbornly dig in their heels, place their fingers in their ears and sing ""la-la-la-la-la-laaaaaa"" to drown out the facts ‚Äì even when a small town in *gasp* heartland America becomes threatened by mass contagion.

Sam, Saul and Casey show up and start dispensing with both assistance and claims that things will only get worse to anyone who will listen ‚Äì which appears to be no-one. Billy arrives on the scene to demand no more talk about this bizarre cover-up, and a cast of mostly good (and in many cases award winning) actors wallow in this mediocrity for another 90 minutes of ennui.

As Sam and Saul go to increasingly great lengths to solve the case and find the cure things get altogether nonsensical, especially once they realise the 'carrier' is a tiny illegal immigrant monkey from Africa, lost somewhere in one of the 50 some landlocked states.

As the virus mutates, morphs and generally becomes more aggressive, the 'management' spout speeches and assorted tripe with buzzwords like 'quarantine', 'containment' and 'eradication', and even if Cuba Gooding Jr said ""Show me the monkey!"" I wouldn't have been surprised.

Alas he didn't, as it might have given me my one and only chuckle in this interminably long and exponentially sillier dross. Another clich√©d button pusher purpose built to scare the gormless and all too trusting.

I recently watched Daylight, another carefully calculated Hollywood built manipulator designed to provoke a response. But that was actually quite well done, a thousand times better than this microscopic bug driven crap. So instead of saying I'd rather watch Daylight a dozen times rather than this I'll say I'd rather watch any of Sly's crappier films a dozen times than this again¬Ö OK maybe not 'Stop! Or my Mom will Shoot'¬Ö

Final Rating ‚Äì 4.5 / 10. If you can't guess that I think this film sucks by now I don't know what to tell you. So instead of a neat summation I'll merely add this fun fact: Kevin Spacey rocks the worst dyed wig of any actor I think I have ever seen in this movie."

There is a Bollywood copy known as Bichoo (Scorpio).

57,Priest (1994),01-Jan-1994,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," Priest, by Antonia Bird, is very beautiful and also provocative film about faith, church, forgiveness and tolerance, which all have as many shapes as there are human beings. The film tells the story of a priest who arrives to new town and soon he notices some things he don't consider too acceptable, and learns also that incredible and selfish evil lives inside every human being, including himself.

The film is a powerful study about religion and many ways to interpret and obey its orders. How can a priest do his ""good"" job as he is rotten and evil inside and there is always the chance of Sin lurking somewhere? The main point is that no human is purely good and without any flaws and everyone sins, priests too. The purification can be reach only by forgiving and being tolerant and loving towards others, and thus the peace of mind and happiness may be reached: trying to be as good as human being can. Forgiveness and love are the most important things and the film ends in extremely beautiful scene at the church, as at least one little person forgives the priest for his ""crimes"" and sees into the heart and soul of the priest. We cannot judge someone for something because there are no sinless people in the world. The narrow-mindedness is one problem the film deals with, and it is sad to see that these things take place in real life, too. The film is very deep and beautiful and also funny and it unfolds more and more with each viewing time. This should be seen by persons who ""cannot forgive"" someone for something he/she has done. What is the benefit people think they get by not forgiving someone and hating someone? As I mentioned, the power of love, forgiveness, and tolerance are the main themes of the film so there are no people in the world, who this film cannot be recommended. This is like Abel Ferrara's and his screenwriter's work, but not as fierce and relentless as their work. Priest is a little more restrained and ""easier for everyone to watch"" version of the themes of Ferrara and St. John.

Remarkable, beautiful, touching and forces the viewer to think. 9/10 masterpiece."
58,Quiz Show (1994),01-Jan-1994,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," In the 1950's the law didn't protect as a good as it does today. Quiz Show movie was shown to the public in 1994. It dramatizes about the scandals in the show Twenty One because there was discrimination with Herbert Stemple who was a humble and smart person (nerd). In the Twenty One game, Herbert was playing with an opponent. In that game the host was Jack Barry who asked the questions to the contestants. They played for points, so the person who scored highest won the game. In that game Herbert won $64,000 dollars and after that he was still winning various games.

The producers, who were Dan Enright and Albert Freedman, were seeing that the program didn't show the ratings that they wanted, so they expected that was for the nerdy guy who had a poor appearance. So Dan Enright and Albert Freedman contacted Van Doren, who was handsome with a good appearance, and was a college professor in the Columbia University. The producers met with him before the show to tell him that they were going to give him the answers because they wanted him to be the protagonist for all the shows. At the same time they talked to Herbert to tell him that if he lost the game they are going to put him in another show. So they played. When Barry asked him the last question and Herbert knew it, but he missed the answer and obviously Van Doren won.

Van Doren was winning a lot of shows and making a lot of money in the easy way called FRAUD. Then appeared Dick Goodwin, who was an idealistic Congressional lawyer, and he got access to Van Doren. He was visiting him for several times and Goodwin started to suspect about why Van Doren was wining all the quiz shows. After that Barry was investigated in anywhere to try the proof that the Twenty One show was a fraud. Then Van Doren was tired about that he was doing and in the next show he told the producers that he didn't want to win with their help because it was to be a scandal for him and his family. So he lost the next game. Van Doren went to talk with his father and he was disappointment because his son was embarrassed his family with that fraud.

So, Van Doren was embarrassed and he decided to say the truth in the committee meeting in Washington because he thought that is better for the people felt that he had deceived them. Yet he felt peace inside himself, and the producers were fired for the fraud. The Twenty One show was canceled.

In my opinion, I didn't like the end of the movie because the law didn't work well because nobody went to the jail. If the people do a fraud they have to go to jail because they were wrong. In the movie Van Doren just said, ""I made a mistake and that's all"". And he walked way like he didn't do anything.

In conclusion, sometimes the people don't make the money, the money makes the people"
59,Three Colors: Red (1994),01-Jan-1994,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," British critics were always envious as to how French cinema effortlessly made intelligent films containing a lot of talking. Three Colours: Red was directed and co-written by Polish Kieslowski and is set in Swiss Geneva. Although if you have ever been to Geneva Airport, there is an exit which takes you to French soil.

The film in his heart has two stories that could be interchangeable. Is it a story about the law student Auguste or the experiences of the judge in his younger days?

Valentine is a student and part time model living in Geneva, her boyfriend is in England. She runs over a dog and goes to see the owner, a retired cynical and aloof Judge. She discovers that he uses devices to eavesdrop on his neighbours phone conversations.

One of the neighbour's Karin is the girlfriend of Auguste, the law student who lives near Valentine's house. Although horrified by the Judge's actions she gets to know the Judge and they become friends.

This film was the last of the Three Colours Trilogy and it signifies Fraternity. The characters who are disparate are connected somehow. Auguste and Valentine are neighbours and so is the Judge and Karin. Judge's relationship with a past girlfriend mirrors the unravelling of Auguste's and Karin's.

By the end the characters mingle with some of the characters from the other two films. Kieslowski brings his films full circle.

It is a thoughtful film but it also has lots and lots of talking. Red plays a strong element in the design and cinematography, although it is well made, even elegantly constructed I did find the pace leaden."

She tries to kill herself, but cannot, so she .... puts everything in trust for her mother and her husband's servants, orders the house sold and the proceeds added to the trust, has one night of passion with her husband's colleague, Beno√Æt R√©gent, then leaves. She rents a cheap apartment, spends her time watching other people, and drifts.

She tries to disappear into nothingness. However the world keeps intruding.

Since this is the first of Krzysztof Kieslowski's TROIS COULEURS trilogy, I kept looking at the colors. He's obvious in his palette, using blue for sadness, red for life, and a general sepia wash for the anomie and observational phase of the movie.

Yet to reduce a discussion of this fine movie to the technical tricks of the trade does no justice to its rich story, and the way everything in the world comes together to bring Miss Binoche to a realization of her own place in the world and her own nature. There are some startling realizations along the way, and Kieslowski and Miss Binoche are patient and deliberate in this portrait, teasing the audience into being interested in this character, who seems to be nothing without her husband and child, and desires to be nothing. In the end, I like to think, like Kieslowski and Binoche's Julie, we are all more than we seem."
61,Three Colors: White (1994),01-Jan-1994,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," White is a Polish film in Polish and French with English subtitles. The film is the second series in the Three Colours trilogy which started with the film Blue and ends with Red. The film takes place in France where a man named Karol Karol whose wife Dominique just divorced him. To make matters work Karol's bank account is frozen and he has no money and no place to go. In the subway he meets a man named Mikolaj who helps him get back to his homeland of Poland. Karol eventually gets there, but not the way he planned on. Once he gets to Poland some friends help him get back on his feet and establish himself. Soon he is doing fine, but is still upset over what Dominique did to him. So with some more help he plans a scheme of revenge to get back at her. Winner of The Silver Berlin Bear for Best Director (Krzysztof Kieslowski, who also co-wrote the film) at The Berlin International Film Festival. White has good direction, a good script, good performances by the entire cast, good original music and good cinematography. White is a very interesting film. From where it started off in the beginning I had no idea how it would end or what would happen next. It kept me following the movie eagerly waiting to see what happened next. It is a very smart and sharp story and the acting and great direction make this film really stand out as well. This film is in no ways similar to Blue, the previous film in the series and I really admire the director for making two totally different films that each work really well. I really loved White because of it's sharp script and because it kept me compelled and interested and I really did not know how it was going to turn out. After these two great films I'm looking forward to completing the series by watching Red. Judging by what I thought of Blue and White, I'm sure I'm going to like Red very much as well."

Scott is persuaded by his son to don the Santa suit but accidentally invokes the Santa Clause. Scott is obligated to become the new Santa. A strange way to choose a new Santa, if you think about it we have a chain of accidental or unwilling Santa Claus's.

Things go a little Miracle on 34th Street as his son believes his dad is the real Santa. His ex-wife and her new nerdy husband who is also a psychiatrist are sceptical and fight to end Scott's visitation rights. It does not help that Scott has now put on a lot of weight and magically sprouted long grey hair and beard.

The film was a big hit at the box office when it was released. It is a pleasant family film enjoyable by kids, slightly old fashioned but passable CGI effects. I thought the whole visitation rights subplot was rather silly and far fetched."

Dedicated to his mentally backward brother and reclusive, overweight mother, grocery worker Gilbert Grape (a nicely understated Johnny Depp) rethinks his life after meeting an attractive young woman passing through town. The film has finely-balanced little moments that spring up at you, however Mary Steenburgen's role as a cheating wife isn't really necessary (it's just there to give us some input into Gilbert's situation), but Juliette Lewis, John C. Reilly and Crispin Glover are very charming as Gilbert's friends. Leonardo DiCaprio...you gotta hand it to him, he pulls off a tricky role with amazing aplomb. Hallstrom's film doesn't always strike the chords it wants to, and occasionally it seems to intentionally wobble while juggling its emotional priorities. Some scenes that should cut deep don't (as with Gilbert shopping at the competition and getting caught by his boss, or with Gilbert letting neighborhood kids get a peek at his mother). Still, a pleasant, thought-provoking outing, one that is nonchalant about its emotions (and its brains). It isn't a heady mix of dramatic ideas, but it does leave you with something--thoughts that may return to you a day or so after seeing it. **1/2 from ****"

Compare While You Were Sleeping, for instance, with Must Like Dogs. While still hewing to the traditional rom-com plot arc, the latter has subtlety, wit, depth, and a delicate touch. While You Were Sleeping Does not.

Everything about this movie is predictable, including Bullock's performance. It's interesting to see the earlier work of someone who's been in the business for over 15 years. In her case (as is the case with the bewilderingly overrated Julia Roberts), Bullock seems to have developed a set of pat reactions early on and not strayed too far from them.

The only redeeming feature of this picture is that it's not *completely* insulting to our intelligence. Plus there are some believable, though stock, performances by supporting players. Other than that, it has nothing to offer."

Well excluding any other Jim Carrey movie of course. His manic, rubbery, over-the-top presence is really quite unique and this was the film that announced his talents to the world.

In simple terms this is a whodunnit and really the plot is quite tight and more than sufficient for the movie. The twist is that the story revolves around a stolen dolphin and now I think about it I really don't know why the villain bothered with this cetacean at all. Still they did and that act brings in Ace Ventura.

What he brings is a glorious anarchy, a character who marches to a different beat and does so successfully. Carrey commits to his role absolutely (much like, say, Robin Williams) and that's why the film works. Nothing is held back and you can't help but be swept along.

That doesn't make it a comedy classic but it's a hell of a ride and the jokes just keep on coming. Not all of them land true but by the time that you realise another three gags have been and gone. What a debut!"

What it is: a comic-genre film - and like most film versions of dark comics, it is enslaved to rain and shadows, candlelight and eyeliner aesthetics, pseudo-intellectualism and faux-poetic moments. It suffers greatly from an unbelievable premise (murderous super bad guys run wild in the streets, doing their will) and mind-numbingly dense dialog.

I watched this movie just recently for the first time - and had to check all the background material on it because I just couldn't believe it was actually shot in the nineties - it is an eighties movie in every way shape and form, hearkening back to the days of the early Cure, Bauhaus, Souxsie and the Banshees, etc.

The acting is flat all around (Brandon Lee spends the entire movie with his chin on his chest, glaring menacingly from underneath his furrowed brow) and what little there is of character is two-dimensional - a comic book view of the world, juvenile and meaningless, trying desperately to be ""deep"".

If Brandon Lee hadn't died during production, this film would be regarded as nothing more than an amusing goth fantasy - and not the goth cult classic it seems to have become. I guess I understand some people's emotional attachment to it, but back when I was being goth and under the influence of nihilist aesthetics, my friends and I read Baudelaire, Sartre and Dostoevsky. To us, a film like this would be as intellectually an emotionally fulfilling as the popcorn you might eat while watching it.

The ""best movie ever""? Sorry. No."

Romantic comedies often throw people off because they tend to be cheesy or depressingly sugar-coated. However, this is a truly wonderful movie.

First off, the cast is terrific. They play off of each other wonderfully and it makes for a delightful atmosphere. Just take the lead, Hugh Grant, whose character doesn't appear fit the stereotypical lead at all. The humor is very witty, and the jokes are guaranteed to make you laugh even after you've seen the movie a dozen times.

Situations in the movie are set up to be played out perfectly. In one scene Hugh Grant is at a wedding and is seated with all of his ex-girlfriends. The scene is set up for utter humiliation.

Even with the quick-witted characters, and all the weddings, it wouldn't be a movie without that touch of drama that for many might just get a tear out of them.

Hands down all around great movie to fit most every occasion."

The Mask is one of the most well known of these films. Carrey stars as Stanley Ipkiss, a lowly bank clerk who stumbles upon a mysterious mask that turns him into a maniacal green faced nutcase who has the ability to do anything. The first thing he uses this mask for is to rob a bank, which sets off a whole series of events involving a ruthless band of gangsters and a beautiful night club singer named Tina Carlyle, played by Cameron Diaz in her very first feature film.

Now, despite this being a well known Jim Carrey film, it's also a very bad film. This is where physical humor blows up in your face and becomes unbearably moronic and not funny in the slightest. I honestly feel sorry for the talented and actually funny Jim Carrey for being subjected to such idiocracy in this film. He can't even save the overall pathetic attempts at comedy. The jokes and physical humor in this movie range from absolutely atrocious to almost worth a chuckle, but the latter is far and few between. The majority of this film is just dull and lifeless dribble that wants to be funny but can't find the right chords to stroke. It misses the mark again and again as it becomes more ridiculous and stupid as the film goes on. Needless to say, about ten minutes into the film I couldn't wait for it to end.

The problem with a film like this is that it knows its all about the comedy. It only seeks to deliver funny jokes and entertaining gags, rather than a deep and intellectual storyline and skillfully woven character development. The Mask obviously has neither of the aforementioned things, but it doesn't have the funny to replace them. The only way to really put it is that this is just not a funny movie. It isn't even painful to watch bad, it's just so dull, so lifeless, and so sloppily made and poorly constructed that I can't think anything of it.

I don't want to give the impression that I possess a searing hatred for The Mask, I only want it to be known that it is just not a good film and not something worth watching. It's a waste of an hour and forty minutes, not because it is the worst movie ever made, but because it is so underwhelming and so forgettable that you accomplish absolutely nothing by watching it. There are plenty of other Jim Carrey movies worth checking out before you waste your time with The Mask."

I like Clint Eastwood, and I love ""Brisco County Jr."" (which this is very similar to), but I never cared for ""Bonanza"" or ""Gunsmoke"" and I don't know what Gary Cooper looks like. This movie was not a typical western, though, as it sought to make itself fun and added in so many subtle references (especially the ""Lethal Weapon"" nod) to old westerns, country music and Richard Donner films.

Hidden in the movie are Corey Feldman, Margot Kidder, Waylon Jennings, Clint Black and more. I did not recognize them. (Believe me, if I had recognized Corey Feldman I think this film would have received an 8.) Also, the film co-stars James Garner, who was the original Maverick in the TV series.

The plot: Maverick (Mel Gibson) must collect money owed to him to raise $25,000 in order to enter a high-stakes poker tournament on a steamboat. Along the way, he befriends a sheriff (James Garner) and a swindling yet beautiful woman (Jodie Foster). Also, Graham Greene appears.

Seriosuly, the film comes down to an endless series of fun events as Danny Glover parodies his ""Lethal Weapon"" role, Graham Greene plays an unusual Indian, a Russian archduke shows up for no apparent reason and many wacky card games and gun fights ensue. No excessive violence and very mild sex (this is PG, you know) make for a great time without getting too ""adult"".

If you liked the lightheartedness Richard Donner gave to ""Superman"" or ""The Goonies"" and you'd like to see more of that in the Old West, this is the film you are looking to find. Or, as I said, rent the first season of ""Brisco County Jr"" - you'll be pleasantly surprised."

Brian De Palma makes one of his best (and under-rated) films by letting the viewer be as self-aware of the on-coming chiches and pit-falls of the drama the story intones, just by the narration. The aged, contemplative voice of Carlito Brigante (Al Pacino) that chimes in more often than not, is as essential to the way the story unfolds as Henry Hill's was to GoodFellas- this guys been on the inside, he knows the ropes, he knows the stakes, he knows the nature of the beast that goes with the people he associates with, and now that he's out of prison, he doesn't want it anymore. Un-like a lesser film, we start to believe his intentions and reasonings.

Carlito's just been released, thanks in part to his counselor David Kleinfeld (Sean Penn), five years gone in a thirty year sentence, and when he returns to the street many look at him as if he's changed hearing that he's retired. Carlito just wants to get some money together, open a car dealership of sorts with a friend in the Bahamas, and works in a nightclub right smack dab in the heart of the coked up late 70's. As Carlito's tale unfolds, so does Kleinfeld's, as an inmate who's a client of his makes a demand that he can't turn down, which in turn brings a perpetually reluctant Carlito along with him.

Another wise decision on De Palma's part was the casting: Pacino's screen presence is sometimes enough to be intimidating, but his performance as Carlito is the part of the heart of the movie (the other part is with Penelope Ann Miller as his estranged girlfriend), compelling, tough, and intelligent from years of dope dealing and soaking up the gang-land atmosphere around him. Personally, I would put this over Tony Montana any day, if only because the accent rings truer as do his emotions. Then there's Sean Penn as Kleinfeld, a scheming, vain little man who starts off seemingly as legitimate as a lawyer of criminals, but as we soon learn, he has slipped into a world that he has no place to belong in. When I first saw little sections of this movie on TV, previous to recently watching it all the way through, I really didn't know who it was playing Kleinfeld, with his balding, curly hair and nervy, cranked voice appearing like it was Sean Penn, only as Woody Allen if he were ever an attorney. However, when the viewer looks into his eyes, both terrified and ravenous, one can understand the pathway to excess that most conventional crime movies take for granted.

Including supporting work by Penelope Ann Miller and John Leguizamo as the convincing critter Benny from the Bronx, and magnificent set-pieces that confirm De Palma's worth as a director of thrillers as well as dramas, this is an example of Hollywood movie-making that is waiting to be discovered over and over again, as proof of the value that can come in re-fashioning a genre piece."

Apparently, Cruise insisted only his name be at the top of the movie poster, which is unfortunate because the film works not only because of him but the rest of a stellar cast working with a fine screenplay. Along with Cruise, just about every other actor in the cast contributes to this film's success, particularly Jeanne Tripplehorn (who has just about as much screen time as Cruise), Gene Hackman, Holly Hunter, and Wilford Brimley, who plays against type as a ruthless ""Mr. Fix-it"" for the firm. Hunter was nominated for Best Supporting Actress. Honorable mention also goes to Ed Harris, David Strathairn, and Hal Holbrook.

Mitch McDeere is a stellar law student graduating from Harvard. He's being recruited by all the top law firms in the US, focusing on tax and property law. One law firm out of Memphis, TN, Bendini, Lambert & Locke, makes it clear they want him badly, and make him the biggest offer than any other firm (respective of geographic location). In other words, a $100,000/year salary in Memphis is worth about $175,000 in New York.

He and his wife Abby visit Memphis and the law firm, and find out a few strange things. Abby picks up on them but Mitch is rather oblivious. They hang out with another young couple whose husband has also just joined the firm. A couple of little items are mentioned by the other wife, that the firm encourages children and are not against a wife of an associate working. Huh? Since when does a law firm get to approve or disapprove of an associate's family situation? Mitch only sees the good and dismisses the red flags but Abby is concerned.

Despite the red flags, Mitch takes the offer, and the couple move into a nice house furnished by the firm who also puts in their telephones. They're told that the firm does all the telephone installations. Pretty quickly we learn the firm is bugging the McDeeres' household. Then two law firm associates were killed in some kind of a boating accident. Mitch and Abby meet with the young couple they had met during their exploratory visit. Both are distraught with grief.

Mitch is then paired with Avery Tolar (Gene Hackman), his assigned mentor to help with the bar exam. Mitch then learns no one at the firm ever failed the bar exam. Avery takes Mitch to the Cayman Islands to meet with one of their clients, who appears to be a bit sleazy. Who are the firm's clients? At night on the beach at the Cayman's, Mitch makes a behavioral decision which will deepen his commitment to the firm, but on their terms, not his. But that takes on more of an implication when he learns other law firm associates died under mysterious conditions which is confirmed by two FBI guys at a cafe, who inform him that no associate has ever left Bendini, Lambert & Locke alive.

The crucial scene comes when Mitch is given a message at a tax law conference in Washington DC to take a bus to a park. There he meets the agent he met in the cafe and another head agent. He is told his life as he knows it is over. Or is it? The FBI agents want him to steal files from the firm, which include illegal activity of their clients. Unfortunately, if Mitch engages in this behavior, he could jeopardize his future to practice law as this could violate the attorney-client privilege which states that a lawyer cannot reveal incriminating information about his or her client.

The whole point of the film is about how Mitch McDeere must straddle the pressure of the US government, his commitment as an attorney, and his life and relationship with his wife. A thoroughly compelling film from beginning to end. The finale of the film is quite a bit different than the novel, but I somewhat preferred the ending of the film to that of the book. Great performances by the whole cast. Cruise and Tripplehorn have great onscreen chemistry. Strathairn is also compelling as Mitch's brother to whom he reconnects. And Gene Hackman is compelling as the rogue associate at the firm who is allowed to mess around."

Today I think it has been forgotten, and in part I feel sorry for it. However, I believe that the film has already done its job: not only did it entertain those who saw it and continue to see it, but it also had a certain social role in the way it awakened in younger people (but not only them) a certain awareness of ecology, for the preservation of endangered animals and species. I also believe that the film had a certain responsibility for changing the thinking of zoos and places that keep animals in captivity: instead of being ""animal deposits"" for public entertainment, they became institutions with ever greater relevance in the preservation of animals: today, they are essential for the survival of species whose natural habitats have been destroyed and which are only perpetuated in captivity. They also take the lead in the assisted reproduction of many animals, such as the Giant Panda Bear, for example, as well as in the rescue, veterinary treatment and preparation of animals that, having been illegally hunted or lived many years in human company, need to return to wildness.

Thus, this film turns out to be more relevant for the effect it had on people than by itself. Analyzing it in a simple way, it is a rather sugary film, loaded with clich√©s and without great artistic quality. A family entertainment film, excellent to watch with the kids and which, for years, was almost institutional on television during the Christmas season. The script is quite simple, and takes a rebellious and angry teenager to regenerate when he begins to have contact with an orca that has lived in captivity for years. The friendship between them is touching and sincere, as well as the boy's efforts, and the friends he makes, to release her to the seas, in a race against time and against the action of the villains, the owners of the park where she is kept, and who don't care about her at all. It is an extremely predictable film, which excessively romanticizes the release of animals kept in captivity, making the public forget that a whole previous preparation is necessary, taking several years, and that we never know if the animal, after years depending on humans, is it really going to adapt. Keiko, the orca that the movie used (and who lived in captivity for years after the movie), would eventually be prepared and released to the sea, but as we know, she never adapted to the wild.

The film has a good cast, but a terrible conception of characters. None of the characters are really good and all are clich√©s: the heroic teenager, the Native American full of ancestral wisdom who knows animals like no one else, the arrogant capitalists with no respect for anything or anyone... Excluding the orca Keiko, it's Jason James Ritcher who will stand out as an actor, in the role of the teenager who saves the day. He does what it takes, and I think he was relatively credible in his effort. Michael Madsen also deserves praise for his work, in a film that, incidentally, will be one of the most popular of his artistic career. Lori Petty and Jayne Atkinson are pretty good, August Schellenberg does what he can with the clich√© given to him. The rest simply doesn't matter.

Technically, the film stands out for its good cinematography. A lot of '90s movies seem ancient when we see them now, but this is one of those laudable exceptions that deserves to be mentioned. The filming locations, as well as the sets, also deserve a positive note for their visual beauty. The sound effects are very good, and the visual and special effects deserve praise, in particular the animatronic whale, which is quite realistic. Finally, a note to praise the quality of the main theme of the soundtrack created for this film, which is one of the most beautiful of its time."

It's funny how your tastes change over the years: back in 1993, I thought that Hot Shots Part Deux was unrelentingly hilarious; this time around, the film had me giggling a few times, but the majority of the jokes seemed incredibly lame and puerile. I guess I'm more sophisticated than I give myself credit for.

Sheen is passable as a comic actor, Valeria Golino is ravishing as love interest Ramada, and Richard Crenna mercilessly mocks his Col. Trautman role in the Rambo movies.

Revisiting the same kind of off-the-wall comedy that they collaborated on with Sam Raimi in Crimewave, The Hudsucker Proxy, with which Raimi would share a screenwriting credit, with both, owed much to the 1950s Hollywood screwball comedies of Howard Hawks and Frank Capra.

Taking a job in the mailroom before coming to the attention of Paul Newman's slimy Sidney Musberger who seeks to exploit Barne's oblivious nature. Smelling a Rat of course is the dedicated news reporter, with Jennifer Janson Leigh's Amy Archer going undercover, and becoming the unsuspecting Noville's secretary. Yes, you are pretty much on somewhat familiar ground here, with the inevitable romantic subplot on the cards. Predictable though it may be the Coen's compensate for this with some superb stylistic touches.

From the cavernous, depths of the Mailroom, to the gleaming, marbled interiors of the executive offices, The Brother's Coen seemingly creates a world in of itself. Taking their cues from Terry Gilliam's Brazil. It's as grand and elaborate as its goofy, off-the-wall set pieces. From Charles Durning's suicidal Waring Hudsucker (the late Charles Durning) taking a swan-dive from the top floor of his overly towering skyscraper to neatly pastiching the treacly 1950s newsreels of yesteryear. They also brilliantly in a matter of minutes chronicle the growing hula-hoop craze.

The entire cast clearly seemed to be enjoying themselves here, with Robbins throwing himself into his role with considerable enthusiasm. As does Leigh who sublimely channels Katherine Hepburn, while Newman is suitably conniving and aloof, as Musbrger who is nothing more than a figurative snake-oil salesman and huckster. The movie is also well served by its wacky, offbeat characters from a fast-talking elevator operator named Buzz to Amy's crusty Editor and Chief, played by the late John Mahoney of Frasier fame. Not forgetting Sam Raimi regular, and B-movie icon Bruce Campbell as a sleazy, slick fellow journalist, Smitty. Topping them off is Moses, the time-keeper who maintains Hudsucker Industries clock tower, and not only serves as the movie's narrator but who offers some pearls of wisdom and seems to know more than a man in his lowly menial position should. And who in one of the movie's more surreal flights of fantasy freezes time, and partially plays a part in influencing the outcome of the plot.

Indeed, the Coens do let the frenetic pacing get ahead of itself at times, and its kookiness on occasion doesn't quite hit the mark, but there's still some inspired inventiveness. As well as visual and comical panache that offsets it. For whatever shortcomings it has, The Hudsucker Proxy is a charming, goofball comedy bolstered by top performances from a first-rate cast and, rights the wrongs that the filmmaking siblings made with Crimewave."

There's not much cinematic originality either, CGI notwithstanding. The primary visual element here is 'the hand' -- Spielberg's mainstay.

Everything is told through borrowings from other movies, mainly ""King Kong"" (from the first remake in '76), ""Jaws"" (the raptor pen), ""Aliens""(the kitchen evasion and the dropped ceiling escape). Heck, even ""Crocodile Dundee"" makes an appearance.

So back to the intellect - Spielberg's in way over his head when he attempts to explicate chaos theory; Crichton's parallel novel is better for this, if that interests you.

Essentially, all complex systems must eventually behave unpredictably. The thing is, Spielberg never attempts anything complex, and never lets anything out of the control of the guiding hand...he just tries to purport the illusion of complexity: the flea circus writ large.

The entire movie is mirrored by the tour's animated DNA cartoon -- all of the content is meant for the consumption of mental ten year olds.

Malcolm is presented with the proper cerebral depth in the novel; Goldblum knows this is a joke, so he plays this as the comic relief. He's the only real fun here."

The worst defect is the overacting. Emma Thompson is perfectly dreadful as she overdoes it in every scene she has; but the rest of the cast also overact, their facial expressions animated like some cartoon. They all mug to camera except Washington but his part is semi-regal. The less said about Michael Keaton's performance the better - it is comically rank. His accent is a bogus Irish stevedore stuck in Tuscany.

The other annoying feature is the glued on grins and smiles as if this is a Carry On film. If only Sid James had appeared to add some class. And finally the music is a sticky overbearing aural goop that lacks nuance. Film music and Shakespeare are not good companions and in this case, to quote, 'The Tempest', ""misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows.""

The play is one of Shakespeare's very best. It is the very first romantic comedy with ill-matched lovers who find love, but none of that brilliant sparring battle between Benedick and Beatrice is here."

Heinlein's Puppet Masters"" amazes me - because the only resemblance to Heinlein's genuinely chilling short story about Titan 'slugs' are the character names. That's it. None of the wonderfully satirical espionage group shenanigans, none of the gripping suspense, none of the character development, and none of the setting. ""Puppet Masters"" is not supposed to be set in 1994, it's supposed to be set in 1957 - but a different 1957 to the one we know. I mean, this film didn't even attempt the flying cars or the hand-held lasers. Like so many new sci-fi films made from older literature classics, the fiction has been cut out like some sort of hideous tumor and the science has been exaggerated to make sure the audience knows it's SCIENCE fiction. The fact that the science is largely irrelevant is lost on most modern screen writers - and this movie is no exception.

Another example of a perfectly good story that has been shredded to make it 'fit' Hollywood's version of science-fiction, which is largely made up of clanking robots, flashing lights and explosions.

""The Faculty"" was a good SF movie. And it was right - Body Snatchers is a rip-off from this story, but it never pretended to be anything but. Faculty had some enjoyable sequences. It wasn't perfect, and elements were laughable, but despite this, it was true to itself..._this_ film was just the massacre of a perfectly good story.

I only hope anyone else who ever tries to make a movie of a Heinlein classic will stick to the book and make a decent movie, not rehash the story until it sounds good - because they sounded good before."
85,"Ref, The (1994)",01-Jan-1994,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Comedy']," Far from typical Christmas fare, comedy or otherwise The Ref is an under rated classic that is a perfect blend of cynicism and hope, cleverness and bawdy comedy. It has a lot of shrill moments and if foul language makes you uneasy stay away but most will find the obscenities just part of the plot as the resolution of anger and bitterness in the lives of four people is what this film is about.

A sort of ""Ransom for Redchief"" style plot where a very sophisticated cat burglar takes a dysfunctional family hostage on Christmas eve much to his initial regret, this film succeeds in the main on the terrific acting by most of the cast. So much of the comedy is carried through because of small facial expressions, minute actions and razor sharp timing from the participants. The leads are priceless, Judy Davis in particular, although one finds himself quoting the two male leads perhaps more often. Christine Baranski, Glynnis Johns and Adam Le Ferve reveal their absolute mastery of the character actors craft with excellent support that shines in its own right. Phillip Nichol and Ellie Raab as the young nephew and niece provide the perfect foil of innocence for all of the ""adultness"". A great movie to watch as a relief from the typical nostalgic and kid orientated Christmas flicks. There are so many really good Christmas stories and this one numbers among them aimed squarely at grown-ups for a change.

Although Ted Demme changed the ending and is said to have regretted doing so I think it was the right decision adding one last lurch of suspense to the overall mix the first watch around. What happens?-sorry you'll have to wait to open this present yourself."
86,"Remains of the Day, The (1993)",01-Jan-1993,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," This is the Quintessential period piece! The flow of it is so seamless, that like classical music or a beautiful piece of art - you never tire of it. It marks the end of the expansion of prosperity, change and invention of the Victorian and Edwardian eras, that for the first time in history, brought into existence a large, educated middle class. It is the span of this society and it's events that were both passed on to us as a nation, and have had a greater influence on our modern day than any other period. As they were the beginning of the modern era. By the 1930's we come to the end of the rigid class system that had evolved during these periods. This story is in fact all about the servants and is seen from their perspective. Regular working class people, their lives and loves - they are it's real champions. I believe it to be the finest film ever made on the subject, and one of the finest films period.

Easy on both the eyes and the mind, it is effortless to watch. And one of only 3 films that I find myself returning to over and over again, more than any others. Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson who have so many great performances, do their best work here. Here in cinema is a display of excellence in the ordinary, and a celebration of both understatement, and unrequited love. We are only observers here in the sense that there is nothing to figure out, and what we observe is the perfect Servant. One who applies himself wholeheartedly to his craft, and finds contentment in doing his job well. A rarity in both life and cinema. I find it very telling that perhaps the finest English film was a collaboration of men from two former colonies - India and the U.S., a Japanese author, a Celt in the male lead, and a screenwriter from Germany married to an Indian, who has spent most of her life in India and America. These are the people that school us in the culture that birthed our own, and so much of modern western civilization. None of them are English.

The perfect fit that I think James Ivory often reaches for is achieved here. It is a movie without sex, violence, or bad language, which are often added from a lack of strength, not as proof of it. This movie is a tribute to everything good that is England. Merchant and Ivory couldn't have done better.

87,Searching for Bobby Fischer (1993),01-Jan-1993,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," As the father of a child talented at chess (state champion), I really enjoyed watching SFBF. Great story, and great acting by Max Pomeranc.

So naturally, I wanted to learn more about Josh Waitzkin, and much to my disappointment I found that the ending was a complete lie. Yes, Josh did play for the US championship. But in reality Josh didn't win. When Josh was 9 years old, he had a draw against a 7-year old named Jeff Sarwer. And an analysis of the game shows that Jeff was clearly winning, but a mistake cost him, ending the game in a draw.

Jeff Sarwer is an interesting story. In real life, Pandolfini said that he had never met anyone else with such a raw talent for the game. But unlike Josh who grew up in a comfortable surroundings, Jeff really did play speed chess with the drug addicts. His father was considered abusive, and Jeff and his equally talented sister Julia were taken away from his father by protective services. But the kids ran away from a foster home, back to their father, and Jeff didn't play chess again for almost 20 years. And when he did, he beat a number of grandmasters despite having no apparent practice.

So far we know that the ending was a lie (thanks to the Internet making these games from 1985 available), and that Jeff played with the drug addicts. So what is really true?

My unfortunate conclusion is that Josh's dad saw that while his child was talented, he was nowhere close to Jeff Sarwer (by the way, Josh never made GrandMaster). But with Sarwer out of the way, why not make his son look good, and make Jeff look bad. What a travesty!"

The film also has a bit of sadness in its early part, thankfully not overdone. The five lead characters and the performances by their actors (Hanks, Ryan, Malinger, Pullman and O'Donnell) are all engaging.

The primary members of the support cast are also excellent (David Pierce, Annie's brother; Garber and Wilson as Sam's brother-in-law and sister; Reiner as his colleague/friend; young Gaby Hoffman; and Barbara Garrick as Sam's brief girlfriend).

The story, juxtaposed with the classic Grant/Kerr predecessor, could have provided an excessive gimmick, but here it worked well. And I was grateful for some things I didn't find in this flick. Although I watched the program like everyone else, I found Rob Reiner's character, acting and presence in ""All in the Family"" to be obnoxious and annoying, ALL THE TIME, and watched the program in spite of his presence. And I have found Rosie O'Donnell's presence to be the epitom√© of ANNOYING in every respect, every time I've observed her, previously. But in this film, I enjoyed both of their performances completely. Children in movies can also be an irritating presence, but Malinger and Hoffman were delightful as son Jonah, and his little neighbor/friend. Barbara Garrick, with a supporting role here (as in ""The Firm"") is an appealing actress, for whom one would wish more prominent roles.

Tom Hanks is one of the foremost actors of our time, but even he can go a smidgen too far in a characterization (I thought he did so in both ""Forrest Gump"" and ""Philadelphia""). But he certainly didn't here. Watch, enjoy, and feel good."

The visuals are, to be expected, great. It's a creepy Tim Burton clay-mation movie, what do you expect? The way in which it is done screams the 90s, but despite it's age it holds up very well regardless.

The soundtrack is a lot of fun, specifically the opening song. The rest of the songs are worked into the movie very well, and I never dreaded listening to any of them when they did come up. Furthermore, they actually contributed to the story in most cases, so I had to listen anyway

However, without the visuals this would be a very poor movie. The writing is unnatural a lot of the time, and it features an incredibly forced, out-of-nowhere ending scene. On top of that, there are several points throughout the movie where certain events happen for no reason. Jack and other characters know things they never had the opportunity to learn. Sure, we as the audience can piece together that they went to some other character and figured it out, but because that is never shown and it is somewhat important that they do because of how it will affect the story, I have to assume that they didn't happen and that the writers just didn't know what to do because they were running out of time.

Despite this, I more or less enjoyed the movie. I wouldn't say it's good, but it's worth a watch. I'll probably never see it again, and in the end I wouldn't really recommend it."

Tarantino who decided to split Natural born killers and True Romance scripts (which ere basically same script ) made terrifying job at it, but real star behind film is late Tony Scott. Without a doubt, this is best film Scott has ever made, and that can be seen in whole film, from cast to score and even ending which is best thing that Scott decided to do, despite Tarantino's wishes, but even Tarantino himself was pleased at the end of it. Scott gave himself into the film and created cult masterpiece that will never be forgotten. Cast is terrifying. Cristian Slater before he become second rate actor and Patricia Arquete had believable chemistry on screen which made whole film.

Steve Rodgers is actually nice to her and she misunderstands. Brandon starts taking an even more intense interest in her.

Heather Matarazzo is amazingly awkward. It is cringe-worthy. Writer/director Todd Solondz is the king of the disturbing underbelly of society. The bullying is hard to watch. Dawn is not a nice girl but she is the clueless girl trying to find her way. She often hurts people just as others have hurt her. The movie is so uncomfortable that the audience has no choice but to laugh. And then it gets darker. Sometimes it goes over the edge like what happens to Missy.

Do I agree with that? Well, yes, in different ways then others see it. I saw this recently after many years of not seeing it with a more critical mindset. It's a decent movie, but it's not great. You see, when I say it's a ""Christmas classic"" I don't mean it's a great movie. My reason for my usage of the term ""Christmas classic"" is because there aren't many great Christmas movies out there. Besides Elf, and Christmas Story, there aren't a lot of great Christmas movies.

It certainly is a good movie to watch around Christmas, but it does have its flaws and problems. Macaulay Culkin is pretty good in this movie, as well as Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, but the rest of the actors aren't too good. The story has a lot of flaws. First of all, why doesn't Kevin go to a friends' house? Surely not everyone he knows has gone to Paris or something. He lives in a suburban neighbourhood in Chicago with a BUNCH of people, and he can't go to a friends' house? All these flaws I can kinda look past, but I can't pretend they're not there.

Like the others, Aladdin has songs, detailed animation, and a good versus evil setting. It is pretty predictable, and has a main character who usually falls in love with some pretty girl.

One of Aladdins many strong points was the talented voice acting of Robin Williams. The ability to portray so many different and silly characters that the genie does is one of the best parts in the movie. It is similar to how Eddie Murphy got to play Mushu in Mulan.

Something else remarkable about this film was the storyline. The storyline starts off with Jafar (the villain) trying to find the Magic Lamp which will give him three wishes. Jafar finds the Cave of Wonders, in which the lamp is hidden. However, the cave won't let just anybody in. The only person who can enter the cave is a ""street rat"" named Aladdin. Meanwhile, Aladdin is stealing a loaf of bread and running away from the guards. Of course, this means a song would be involved. So, while singing a-long with the guards, Aladdin is stealing a loaf of bread because he has no money. Another plot that is happening at this time, is Jasmine's story. Jasmine has to marry a prince, but doesn't seem to like any of the ones her father picked out for her. The three character's quests and stories later merge together to make the main storyline.

However, in the storyline there is one small flaw. How come Aladdin is the only person who can enter the Cave of Wonders? That's what I have been wondering. Is it just to make a storyline?

Anyways, ignoring that detail, I wanted to say that it seems like Aladdin has a little something for everyone. It has action for the little boys. Girls may like the romance. Little children will probably like the singing and the fact that it's a cartoon. Finally, dads will probably enjoy the fact that Robin Williams is doing the voice acting in this film. (My dad does anyways, and requested to put that in there.) See it.

Although much of the praise this film receives, may be due to the fact that it was it's creator's first attempt at an animated feature, I think it's obvious merits and artistic triumphs are enough to maintain it's place at the top.

First, there is the artwork, which is stunning. The color isn't at it's most vibrant, such as with, say, ""Cinderella"" (1950), but it is suitable and lovely all the same. A virtual watercolor painting come to life. The details in the animation never fail to amaze. Just look at the raindrops in the chase sequence towards the end. Look how they hit the rocks, and slip away. Such attention to detail was rarely matched in an animated feature, except maybe, in ""Pinocchio"" (1940).

The characters are of various degrees of interest, with Snow White, probably the least of these. The dwarfs are all charming, and it is they who carry the film during their screentime with the princess. However, one should not deny, that the true star of this film, is the evil queen. Both in her presence of glamour, and in her transformation as an old crone, she is fascinating to watch. I don't believe another Disney villian has ever been both frightening and enchanting, like she has.

Lastly, the music in this film is truly memorable. The ""Heigh Ho"" sequence is visually impressive, and the dwarfs song as they bathe is a great comedy bit. Not to mention Snow White's anthem ""Someday My Prince Will Come""; another gem in the Disney library.

All in all, a tremendous production. Beautiful, thrilling, and memorable."

""Fargo"" is one of the best American films of the nineties. Joel Coen working together with his brother, Ethan, have made pictures that will be viewed as classics, as time will tell. Their movies are always an excellent way to spend some time because they always manage to deliver, even in films that aren't popular with the public.

A lot of what makes this film work is the amazing casting feat the Coen brothers achieved in giving Frances McDormand and William H. Macy, two of our best film actors, prominent presence in it. The Marge Gunderson of Ms. McDormand is one of the best creations the Coen brothers have produced. The same can be said of William H. Macy's take on the pathetic Jerry Lundergaard, the idiotic man who sets things in motion in the film. Ms. McDormand and Mr. Macy have only one scene together, yet one wouldn't even think about other actors playing these roles.

The supporting cast of ""Fargo"" is a joy to watch. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare make two of the most enjoyable bad guys in memory. These two scum bags are a joke. Anyone in his right mind wouldn't entrust either Carl or Gaer for a hit job. John Carroll Lynch plays Norm, the stoic man who is married to Marge. Harve Presnell is good as Wade Gustafson.

The atmosphere created by the Coens work well. We are constantly reminded of the deep winter seasons of the area where the action takes place. They have given their characters a local flavor and even to hear them talk would take us to that region of the country.

""Fargo"" is a joy to watch thanks to Joel and Ethan Coen."

I slapped on headphones and put the DVD in the Macbook and set sail for a better time's stony realms...I read comments saying ""If only this movie were made now, it would be so much better, blah blah blah,"" and that's the biggest crock of horsesh*t I've ever heard. If it were made now, it would be slicker than slick, void of soul, with the wretched music of our age providing the soundtrack. Heavy Metal circa 1981 has the texture and imperfect beauty that sustaining, lasting art must possess; think Miles Davis' Bi*ches Brew or Sketches of Spain, or the Rolling Stones' Exile on Main Street - that's where Heavy Metal lives. It's not perfect, parts of it are quite flawed, but as a whole, even the flaws are beautiful gems to behold, and I tell you, for every voice barking on about Heavy Metal's flaws being too much to take, I say this: you take your Saw and remakes of Texas Chainsaw and The Omen and whatever else your fetid college brains latch onto as broken things that need fixing, and we'll take Heavy Metal and the original versions of the horror movies mentioned and be artistically far richer. But you're not after richness in art, are you? You're after eye-candy and digitally rendered starscapes, aren't you? Yes, you are. And you're beggars with moldy bread because of it.

I wasn't sure what to expect from this film but since Disney rarely disappoints I decided to give it a go. I'm glad that I did as it was a lot of fun. The story provided plenty of laughs cute characters, excitement that shouldn't be too scary for younger viewers, a touch of romance and a villain who is more comical than fearsome. The story moves at a good pace and at just under eighty minutes doesn't overstay its welcome. There are a few songs of which he jazz number 'Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat' was easily the most entertaining. There are plenty of amusing moments; my favourites involve Edgar and two hounds he has trouble with in the countryside. The animation is really good with beautifully detailed backgrounds and fine character designs. The voice cast do an impressive job of bringing the characters to life. Overall I'd say this is well worth watching for fans of Disney or of animated films in general."
103,All Dogs Go to Heaven 2 (1996),29-Mar-1996,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['Animation', ""Children's"", 'Musical']"," First off, I have to say, I get very irritated when people bad mouth a movie just because it happens to be a sequel. As in it's doomed to fail from the start. This couldn't be more wrong. Fievel 2 and 3 were better than 1, Terminator 2 was better than the first, and in this case, All Dogs 2 is far superior to All Dogs 1.

The first thing I love about this movie is the music. ""I will always be with you"" And ""It's too heavenly"" are some of my favorite songs from any musical ever. The songs are there just enough to be a great accompaniment without being too intrusive. And on top of that, they're good.

When it comes to Don Bluth films, he always has this incredibly dark, gritty tone for the film, and with ADGTH 1, it really made it unenjoyable. It was dark, depressing, and it wasn't for me. I could see why other people might enjoy it, but I was not on board with the feeling or the style. The sequel has far brighter colors and leaves you feeling with more of a happy feeling, which I enjoy far more than being depressed.

I loved the voice cast with them bringing back Dom and introducing Charlie Sheen as Charlie Barkin. I think this casting was great for Charlie. I think the addition of Bebe Neuwirth and Sheena Easton for Annabelle and Sasha were spot on, and I didn't even mind the kid actor as David. I think he was a realistic fun character and I normally don't say that about children characters.

People criticize this film for being peppier and losing the ""idea"" behind the original. In my humble opinion, it was improved with this film. I loved the comedy, the message, the music, and everything about it. It is my favorite sequel ever and in my mind far superior than the original. There are some animation goofs here and there, but it doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment of the film.

When it is all said and done, it is in my top five favorite movies. And i've seen a LOT of movies so that's an accomplishment. If you enjoy happy movies that leave you with a good feeling, regardless of whether it's a sequel or not, I would say give it a watch. It deserves a lot more accolades than it gets.

9.5/10. Since I can't give it a 1/2, i'll round it up to a 10. It deserves it."
104,Theodore Rex (1995),29-Mar-1996,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Comedy']," I saw this only today, and I do agree with the other reviews, it really is that bad. So much so, I am seriously considering putting it on my bottom 20. Before I begin criticising this abominable film, I have to give some credit to Whoopi Goldberg for trying so hard to give her character some credibility if not entirely succeeding for understandable reasons.

The special effects are just woeful, very rushed and lacking any clarity or sharpness. Theodore Rex as a character looks grotesque and horrible as well, and cinematography and editing-wise the film looks cheap. The story is woefully predictable and misconceived, the dialogue is sloppy with any sense of comedy being flushed down the toilet and the direction is wretched. Also, Theodore Rex is too violent for kids and adults I agree will find it a chore to watch due to its own stupidity.

The acting is also dire. Goldberg tries hard, but Armin Muellen-Stahl overdoes it badly in a very clich√©d role as a mad scientist and lacks any menace. Overall, a really bad movie that as far as I'm concerned deserves its dubious reputation. 1/10 Bethany Cox"
105,Sgt. Bilko (1996),29-Mar-1996,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Comedy']," Directed by Jonathan Lynn. Starring Steve Martin, Phil Hartman, Dan Aykroyd, Glenne Headly, Daryl Mitchell, Austin Pendleton, John Marshall Jones, Pamela Adlon, Max Casella, Eric Edwards, Brian Leckner, Chris Rock, Cathy Silvers, Richard Herd. (PG)

The lovable army base grifter from ""The Phil Silvers Show"" is given a 1990s revamp, now played by Steve Martin; no character assassination here, as Martin forgoes mimicry and plays it in a fashion suited to his devilishly charming ways (they share a character name and a few traits, but that's about it). SNL alums Aykroyd and Hartman have their moments, but their talents are often under-utilized; Martin, however, is an energetically slippery force to be reckoned with (he already played an eccentric scam artist in ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,"" so this is old hat for him), milking laughs that wouldn't be there for almost any other comic actor. Rarely a comedy riot, and most of the satirical jabs it takes at ineffective military brass are soft and obvious, but the movie is peppered with enough guffaws to hold one's interest throughout. A lot of the most inspired bits are actually tossed off haphazardly by Martin's quick silver-tongue, requiring more attention from the audience than usual for an ""amiably amusing"" comedy of modest rewards. Phil Silvers' daughter, Cathy, plays one of the officers investigating Bilko's shenanigans.

So bloody awful that not for the first time do I wish there was a minus rating on IMDb. Picked this up in a remainder bin for a couple of dollars and figured I had loved the French original from the fifties so how bad could the remake be? Might be a curiosity item and the cast was pretty stellar - for one the magnificent and rarely misplaced Kathy Bates was in it.

Was I in for a shock. Nothing, absolutely nothing, worked in this movie. The plot, the minescule amount that was there of it, was drivel. There was no character development AT ALL.

Some awful special effects (get those white eyes on the corpse, folks)and a supposedly creepy atmosphere that makes one chortle every time the usually lovely Isabelle gapes in a mirror at herself. Doesn't everyone look in a mirror when they're frightened? I know it's the first thing I think of, as I climb out of bed after a nightmare - I look in a mirror to make myself feel better.

More threads going nowhere than you could count in a ragged old sweater. The lesbian sub-plot that never quite makes it. And it should. It is a key element in this woeful adaptation. Sharon Stone mincing around in an oddly wired looking walk with trampy tight clothes and really high heels and the strangest lipstick that doesn't leave a mark on her frequently lit cigarettes (she's a school teacher in a private school, Catholic, yeah that's believable). And on and on. How does one get funding for such a travesty, thirty million dollars, I believe??? And the overacting of Chazz and Isabelle... I could write a book on that alone. There should be a law against this kind of thing. 1 out of 10 for what I don't know, only that there isn't a zero rating on IMDb. And as I said, we need these movies, just to make us appreciate even the mediocre ones."
107,Moll Flanders (1996),14-Jun-1996,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," Defoe's original novel, even after all these years, is funny, sad, entertaining and fast-moving. The film is basically only sad, with little resemblance to the novel. It is also dreadfully slow in parts. Some of the acting is good- Stockard Channing makes an excellent Madam, and Aisling Corcoran as the little girl is splendid, producing the few flashes of humour, and there are some very nice cameo parts from well-known British and Irish actors. However, Morgan Freeman (normally a very good actor) seems to have a rather variable accent and to be wondering how he got into this film (not quite Dick van Dyke in Mary Poppins, but...), and Robin Wright doesn't really convince me as a lower-class London girl. The costumes and settings give a good impression of what must have been a much less colourful world- particularly effective are the candle-lit indoor scenes. We get an interesting glimpse of the life and customs of late 17th-century/early 18th century England. However, there are some strange anachronisms- for instance, according to the novel, Moll was born in about 1614, but the clients at Mrs Allworthy's house seem to pay with bank-notes, which would have been extremely unusual at that time. Also I doubt that any little girl (even a feisty one like this) brought up in a Catholic orphanage would have used such strong language. This is nit-picking, I know, and it's only a film, but it's a pity that, with a bit more attention to the story-line and the script, the film could have been so much better."

This is a film only truly appriciated if you love little Bruce, and have a healthy respect for Mark's amazing command of fake accents. And if you can't stop staring at Kevin's hair, because it never ceases to amaze.

Besides... they're Canadian. Who doesn't like Canadians?

The short version: if you watch this, you will laugh. If you're a fan of KITH, you will laugh even harder. I can't get ""Happiness Pie"" out of my head, and you won't be able to either, because it's an ingenious song, (and no, I'm not high.)

Bruce is short and moody. We all love Bruce. Mark can make funny faces. We all love Mark. Kevin does that little high-pitched squealing thing. We all love Kevin. Dave is obviously addicted to caffiene and other mood-altering chemicals. We all love Dave. And Scott is very, very gay. So, of course, we love Scott.

Have you ever watched a lousy flick with friends and improvised dialogue for the actors or make remarks in jest about how stupid the film is? Have you ever wondered what happens to the other sock? If you answered yes, you will enjoy ""Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie"".

The premise is that the evil Dr. Forrester is subjecting Mike Nelson and his robot companions Tom Servo and Crow to some of the worst films of all time, as part of a plot to beat the world into submission. Yeah, this premise is pretty weak in itself, but the commentary from these three is what you'll be hooked by.

What this intrepid trio does best is make fun of stinky celluloid for the audience's amusement. They do the unimaginable; they make an utter piece of trash not only watchable, but hilarious. It's open season on ridiculous movies, and the film is merely a showcase of their regular television program of the same name. The film has been my first exposure to the show, which has selected episodes available on tape. Sadly, the show is not broadcast in my area, and sadder still is the news that the series will conclude this year. The unfortunate aspect of this is that I do have a sense of what I'm missing. It's a great concept, and has proven to be popular with many viewers.

The film for the mocking is ""This Island Earth"". A particularly cheesy selection that can actually be found on DVD in its original format without the hilarious commentary. Some people regard it as a sci-fi classic, but it's essentially been brought to better light with the help of the MST3K team. No one is safe. They even mock their own credits. Watch this one with friends if you can; it's really well done."

She has also said on her radio show she hates making ""romantic comedies"" because she doesn't believe in them. I wholeheartedly agree with Janeane here. This film is a trifle at best. She does her best, but overall, it was just another boring, unbelievable ""romantic comedy"" that has no basis in the real world. Whereas there will be some who will say ""suspend your disbelief"", one grows tired of having to suspend it nearly every time you get a romantic film from Hollywood. Janeane's character, for some reason, is usually filmed in shadows and darkness, which makes her look unattractive, while Uma's character is filmed in lighter tones (which probably displeased Janeane and is probably one of the reasons she detests this film). That really hurts the film if we are to buy the premise that Janeane is supposed to be the better looking of the two. As many have said here and on other comment threads, Janeane is not ugly, but in fact, quite beautiful. I haven't read one review where someone said Uma was better looking. Having said that though, I believe that Ben Chaplin's character would more than likely stay with Uma, not Janeane. Many men don't like really intelligent women (and many women don't like really intelligent men), and sadly, Ben probably would have stayed with Uma. And despite the director's attempt to make Janeane unattractive, it doesn't work. Her natural beauty comes through anyway.

I think a lot of Janeane's male fans who are obsessed with her like this film because they like to think of themselves in the Ben Chaplin character, and actually scoring with Janeane. Janeane is a lot more complicated than the character she plays here (real life is always much more complex than Hollywood can imagine), so take a cold shower gentlemen. This is the role that Janeane is best known for, and that's a shame, as this really isn't that good of a film."

And on top of that, it tries to cash in on the reputation of the various TV series' versions of 'Flipper'. And the big problem is with this movie is that nothing really works; it all seems to cancel each other out.

(Spoiler Warning)

Paul Hogan is still quite adept at light knockabout comedy - such as the much-promoted toasting bread with a blowtorch bit - but this is mainly smothered by Elijah Wood's mod grunge moody contemporary teenager thang - which doesn't play to comedy very well.

There's a romantic angle thrown in with one of the local girls; but this is smothered by the attempt at character comedy with the showmanship entrepreneur angle, and the light adventure with the marauding shark bit.

Overall the film is too dull and downbeat to be really fun, and yet too light-hearted to really work as a serious contemporary story.

One bit I really liked however, was in the climactic scene when Elijah moved his eyes rapidly back and forth to show the character contemplating an emotional crunch-point. Elijah is naturally very expressive with his eyes, and he starts to show it off to good use in this movie. (PS: He's also got way hot legs as well - but that's totally beside the point!)"

Con Air is his first favorite film of mine The Rock is his second favorite film of mine. I love this film to death and I can watch it over and over again! This is Nicholas Cage's best performance ever, I love his character FBI Special Agent Dr. Stanley Goodspeed who did saved over 1000 human lives in San Francisco while he raced against time to disarm the bombs! Seriously it is one of my favorite action films and Nicolas Cage's favorite film. This film has everything, it has solid cast, entertaining thrill, Die Hard in a prison a lot of action and it is not boring. The practical effects of the film are well done and are realistic, it has a lot of explosions, car chases and so on. There are no CGI in this film, mostly Nicholas Cage is more interesting in here than Sean Connery is.

""Welcome to the Rock.""

Plot: Nicolas Cage is Stanley Goodspeed, an FBI chemical weapons specialist who is brought into a hostage situation involving a crew of former US Marines, led by a rogue US Marine general (Ed Harris), who have taken over the former prison on Alcatraz Island and are threatening the city of San Francisco with a launch of missiles filled with deadly VX poison gas. Goodspeed finds himself going along on the mission to retake the prison with a squad of US Navy SEALS and John Mason (Sean Connery), a former SAS operative who has been imprisoned illegally for the past two decades, and the only man to have escaped the prison and can use his knowledge infiltrate ""The Rock"".

So that is basically the plot of the film. Stanley Goodspeed, an FBI chemical weapons specialist has to take on a group of Former US Marines who took over the prison Alcatraz with 80 tourists who took them as hostages and they are extortion their government for $100 million or they will launch the rockets on San Francisco. Everyone in this film does a great job. Sean Connery former James Bond, Indy's father from Indiana Jones and the last Crusade (1989) is brilliant in his performance as Captain John Patrick Mason, Special Air Service and Ed Harris as Brigadier General Francis X. ""Frank"" Hummel, USMC Force Recon is brilliant and great villain.

The script was great and the screen writers did a solid job and Michael Bay beside Bad Boys I and II did a really good solid job ever directing it! Con Air was the action film that really introduced me in to Nicolas Cage films so my beautiful mom bought me on my request Con Air, Face/Off and The Rock (1996) on VHS, which I still have all those films on tapes and I own them on Blu-ray and I still keep the old VHS tapes of those films. I love Con Air and The Rock but I hate Face/off which I think it is one of the worst boring lame action films from John Woo and Nicolas Cage ever! But Con Air and The Rock kicks ass I love these two films I love watching them. It is been 20 years anniversary since The Rock 1996 come out, it is my childhood film and I always cherish my childhood movies to death!

Things: I love about this film: Nicolas Cage's character was so caring and awesome, when on the island in prison General Francis X. Hummel's men kill all NAVY Seals team except John Patrick Mason and Stanley Goodspeed, Cage want's to disarme the bombs while Connery want's to get off the island, Cage want's to convince Connery to helps him, which he does on the end. The two fight each other against a team rogue former US Marines to stop them, by killing innocent people. General Francis X. Hummel is not a monster like he was showing in the beginning of the film, he only wanted that government pays the money to the family's for loosing their sons and fathers. I also love the scene in which Sean Connery throws a knife in to one of the marines guarding the rocket, and killing the other marine while firing a machine gun on him awesome!

Overall: I love this flick to death I am giving 10 out of 10 for one of my favorite Nicolas Cage action films.

That's common sense; anyone who does, well, I feel sorry for them. In ""Twister,"" Nature is given a frightening new dimension courtesy of breathtaking Hollywood CGI effects but it's dumbed down by a questionable script and dialogue (thanks to none other than novelist Michael Crichton himself as a co-author, along with wife Anne-Marie Martin) and sub-par acting. Sure, a number of liberties are also taken with tornadoes (""fingers of God"" - one character calls them), but what do you expect from a film directed by ""Speed"" Jan de Bont?

And lastly, who goes to see movies like this for scientific accuracy? I remember watching it with a friend and giving him a nasty tongue-lashing afterwards for his redundant pointing out of the various scientific and factual inaccuracies that abound in it (which he told me had each been identified by his science teacher - go figure). I snapped back, ""Dude, chill out. It's just a movie. Who cares if this does or doesn't happen, or tornadoes don't suck like that."" I basically told him to get a grip.

Nature is unrepentant in its desire to test human will to withstand her destructive forces. I showered praise on ""Twister"" for capturing that and making sure its human characters realize it. I make these statements because ""Twister"" is quite terrifying in its scenes of tornadoes blazing paths of destruction, and this is what people tend to miss when watching it. I know I'm sure to run into flak because of it but, what am I going to do {*shrugs shoulders*}?

As the film opens on the plains of Oklahoma's Tornado Alley, the National Weather Service is tracking several storm systems that if they were to merge any time soon, they could see a record outbreak of violent, tornado-producing severe weather. Next, we're introduced to meteorologist and recent divorc√©e Bill (Bill Paxton) and fianc√©e Melissa (Jami Gertz) - ""She's a reproductive therapist,"" he reassures us, after Bill is asked if she is HIS therapist. Melissa isn't too keen on the idea of storm chasing, which poses a problem for them both, but for Bill it was always the thrill of the hunt, and we know he's not going to pass the opportunity to get back in the mode of things.

We then arrive at a field where we meet the storm chasers, led by Bill's tough ex and fellow meteorologist Jo (Helen Hunt), who has somehow mysteriously forgotten to sign her name to the last page of the divorce papers (she still loves him). When asked if he's back by the various supporting players, he emphatically denies he has returned to his field of expertise. But it turns out, however, that before their marriage went to hell, they had been busy developing a revolutionary storm system-tracking device that could give them the inside knowledge of how tornadoes work.

""DOROTHY"" (real original), the miracle device, a package that contains hundreds of little sensors, could be placed in the damage path and each sensor could provide a detailed map of a tornado's inner-workings and with such knowledge now available, they could design an advanced warning system. The trick is, however, they have to wait until a twister spawns, place Dorothy in its damage path (or ""Suck Zone""), and then run like hell. The action begins when they're forced to take off to chase after the storm, and it's about here the film abandons logic and plot for nonstop special effects, peril, and destruction.

Saying the acting here sucks and is uninspired is like saying we went to see ""Jurassic Park"" (1993) for the performances - understatement - get real. It's easy for any casual movie-goer to pick apart bad acting and lousy story, but come on, it's a roller coaster film. I'm not sure I could put it in clearer writing for you about how we don't go to see movies like this for Oscar-winning actors or plot. I've always liked Bill Paxton (who I personally see as probably being the next Clint Eastwood), and I find it difficult about how he has somehow managed to avoid stardom. Here, his character seems to know how the storm functions and what it ""thinks,"" and in essence he's a human barometer (even his wild days as a radical storm chaser do deserve some laughs).

The writing is substandard, including Jo's barely-hinted upon obsession with chasing the storm (as a child, she saw her dad killed by a monster F5), Lois Smith as Jo's Aunt Meg (who supplies our famished heroes with platters of beef and eggs between effects scenes), the underdeveloped storm chasing team (some of whom are more colorful than others, including Philip Seymour Hoffman as Dusty), and the unnecessary subplot involving stiff competition from Cary Elwes as a corporate-sponsored rival who stole Bill's invention. But this isn't too glaring a problem, if you're a hard-a** for art in cinema and came to ""Twister"" expecting it. You'll see plenty scenes of destruction (just wait for the drive-in showing ""The Shining""), and the music that swells up when tornadoes appear.

Lastly, I can see how anyone who has experienced a twister in their lives could probably want to possibly stay from ""Twister."" I've never seen one and I don't want to. I do know people who have experienced tornadoes; in northern Virginia, where I live, we rarely see the kind of severe weather that produces twisters, but my grandparents, who live close to me, were once in an F1 and thankfully it caused minimal damage to their property and neighbors.

""Twister"" isn't a failure; it's a simple realization of the popcorn blockbuster. Put aside the hard-pressing of art, turn off your brain, and enjoy (but you should still watch out for those flying cows, tanker trucks, and other debris that can become a hostile projectile if picked up by a tornado's winds); it's that simple.

Unfortunately, these are Razzie Awards---awards given for god-awful films and performances. It received an amazing seven nominations and took home six awards--including Worst Movie and Worst Actress! This puts the film is a very unique league...as few films have been nominated or won like ""Striptease"". This alone is the reason I watched the film...I was curious how bad this bad movie could be.

The film is about Erin, a divorced mother whose husband is a trashy criminal...yet we are to believe the judge game HIM custody. Regardless, this ex- made sure she lost her job and now she has been 'forced' to become a stripper. With no experience, she instantly becomes a star attraction and the men in the club go positively insane when she dances. During one of these times, a crazy congressman (Burt Reynolds) gets out of control and soon all sorts of unforeseen situations result.

So is this really a bad film? But what's surprising is that it's basically an ultra-low budget trash film...or that's what it looks like. Yet, inexplicably, the movie had a HUGE budget--including $12,000,000 for its star, Demi Moore!! Why they chose her, I have no idea as her appearing semi-naked didn't help the film to become a success. Instead, they could have easily gotten a cut-rate stripper and saved a LOT of money. And I think this huge budget and big studio treatment for essentially a trash film is why it got so many Razzies. If it was just some cut-rate trash film, no one would have noticed it and the film would have quickly disappeared.

The film suffers because it's a bizarro script that seldom makes sense, has characters who simply are caricatures instead of believable members of the human race and because the film cannot decide what it wants to be. Is it a comedy? Is it a raunchy film? Is it a drama about a mother trying to regain custody of her kid? Is it a murder mystery? Is it a film about politics and the abuse of power? Is it an episode of ""The Jerry Springer Show""? Any one of these might have worked...but together the film is just brain-achingingly weird and nonsensical--especially by the very end. Not bad enough to have earned 6 Razzies...but pretty bad."

Personally, I don't consider The Cable Guy a comedy at all. Sure, there are some side splitting moments - Carrey is hilarious alongside Matthew Broderick's by the numbers 'average Joe', but id suggest that anyone who was not taken in by this film to look at it a little differently...

This is a horror film. I swear!

For me, Chip Douglas does not come across to me as a harmless lisping clingy chump - HELL NO! The guy is a maniac. An obsessive, intelligent, controlling, stalking ""Fatal Attraction"" styled nutter!

For me, this is Jim Carrey's career launching performance. He has a lisp right? after a while, you don't really notice it do you? Right. This is an incredibly difficult task for an actor - maintaining a speech impediment for an entire film, keeping it level, and not exaggerating it, its really something to take a look at. Carrey's character is sick, and very very creepy. With Broderick et al giving relatively standard performances, Carrey's performance is a stand out, and Ben Stiller should be proud of this film and what it lead to in terms of Jim Carrey's career.

Trust me, if you didn't like this, take another look, and prepare to be freaked out by a very not funny, very creepy Carrey performance...

It has an pleasing mix of stars who hit their stride in the 80s (Fox,Wallace, and Ermey) and others who count this as among their first works (Alvarado, Busey, McBride). It is an odd mix of horror and humor from Peter Jackson and had state-of-the-art special effects for the time.

The Frighteners, filmed and produced in New Zealand, was the biggest special effects movie made at that time outside the Hollywood movie base. It made extensive use of blue screens and had over 400 computer-enhanced special effects. Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh wrote the script and Jackson directed and produced the film.

The Frighteners has an overall tone of whimsy but also has some impressive horror movie moments. The Danny Elfman score fits the movie perfectly. Frank Bannister, played by Fox, is a widowed psychic investigator exploring supernatural goings on in a placid rural town. Newcomer Alvarado plays his romantic interest. Veteran actor John Astin plays a ghost called The Judge who has seen his better days. Ermey plays drill instructor (go figure), Sgt Hiles, who is in charge of the local cemetery. He has several lines and a general demeanor that pays homage or satirizes (depending on your viewpoint) his character in 1987's Full Metal Jacket. Jake Busey plays a good bad man, and McBride plays a funny role as Bannister's ghostly aide.

The Frighteners is amusing, frightening, entertaining, and a bit exhausting. It is a great Fall or Halloween movie."

In my opinion, John Travolta deserved at least a nomination for an Oscar here, if not the award itself. The story was decent, but the performances of Travolta, Forest Whitaker, Robert Duvall, and Kyra Sedgwick made me care about what was happening on the screen. By no means is this a romantic comedy. It's romantic, probably the most romantic film I have seen in a long time. The reason for that is simple...it's real. In most movies you see the main characters sleep together within a day at the most, which rarely happens with two people who are really in love. True love has to take time and effort, which is exactly what you see here. Travolta's George is patient, but not because he wants to be. If you're a romantic at heart you will understand and relate to him, and you will hope for his success as you would for your own. Without giving anything away, I will tell you that the ending is sad, but also heartwarming. George has his ""experience"" for no other reason than to suggest what we as humans can become. Phenomenon is a story about our potential, the good and bad things that can happen to us if we achieve it. We could only be so lucky, and watching the movie is a good start.

Roger Ebert wrote, ""Watching this plot unfold, I was remembering last week's 'Heavy,' which also premiered at Sundance; its cafe was run by an older woman (Shelley Winters), and had a veteran waitress (Deborah Harry) and a young waitress (Liv Tyler), and had a regular customer whose name was Leo, not Joe, although he was played by Joe Grifasi. Also echoing in the caverns of my memory were several other movies about stalwart women running cafes and striding above the local gossip: The Ballad of the Sad Cafe, Fried Green Tomatoes, Staying Together and of course Bagdad Cafe."" Indeed, something about this film felt derivative or cheap, like it belonged on the Lifetime network and not as a film championed by the fine folks at Sundance.

I also heard it has some scenes taken out and what not. A little disappointed by this copy, but oh well.)

Police Story 3 (Or Supercop) is certainly an entertaining film. Where it lacks in story, it certainly makes up for it in stunt work. Your jaw will constantly be on the floor during the action sequences.

The story here is... pretty weak. Jackie Chan goes undercover to stop... a bad guy who sells drugs? Or buys them? It can be quite unclear and confusing. So if anything brings this movie down, it would be the story.

Luckily, the film is jammed full of some amazing stunts. Chinese/Hong Kong action films almost always impress, and this film is no exception. The last 15 minutes of so has some really crazy stunt work. I have no idea how they allowed the actors and stunt men to do the things they do, because they are risking their lives by doing them. There's a fight on a moving train where they have no safety harnesses or anything. Jackie Chan hangs from a ladder on a helicopter that is flying extremely high above the city. Michelle Yeoh jumps onto a moving train on a dirt bike. It's crazy but makes the film exhilarating to watch. You feel the danger within the scene, and it's a thrill.

There's also a fair amount of comedy in this film, which is something that I can be a little weary about in action, but it works in this film. It surprisingly doesn't take away from the intensity, and it just works to make the film more entertaining and fun to watch.

This is a film that needs to be seen by action fans. It could have been stronger story wise, but it contains some stunts that many would consider among the best. Check it out if you wanna have some mindless, cheesy fun."

I don't feel that the relationship between Corky and Violet is something that you should have to ""get past"" being that the tone of the film is that of escape (hence the title ""Bound"") and the very nature of their relationship upholds that idea. However if you are less open-minded regarding your own sexuality or completely homophobic, the scattered and brief exchanges between the two leading characters may not settle well with you. One of the best things about the film is the cinematic detail, all the little disturbing and intriguing things that the Wachowskis chose to hone in on...If you are a fan of The Matrix films, you'll really get to see where it all started with Bound.

I could rattle on forever about the pure genius of the film and that of the Wachowski Brothers but I won't. Just see the film for yourself, you'll either hate it or love it."
130,Kansas City (1996),16-Aug-1996,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Crime']," The music is superb. The movie is so-so. The period sets are perfect and its just like being back in KC during the infamous Pendergast era. Altman made this movie as a paean to his hometown and the music that came out of it. One cannot divorce the music from the movie. Either you are a jazz fan or you're not. If you're not, you won't like this movie. Its that simple. If you are, you are really in for a treat. The film features all of the ""new"" stars in jazz from the mid-90's (James Carter and Craig Handy on saxes, Mark Whitfield on guitar, Geri Allen and Cyrus Chestnut on piano....the list goes on and on. They all play the legends of jazz that came out of Kansas City-people like Count Basie, Joe Williams, Lester Young and Coleman Hawkins. A veritable treat for the in-the-know jazz fan but probably a bore for anyone else. Altman stays on the music longer than most directors would because this is a film about the music as much as it is about the plot.

And here's the real irony. Movie buffs will say they wished Altman wouldn't have devoted so much time to the music and jazz buffs will say they wished Altman would have done away with the ridiculous, annoying plot and grating performance by Jennifer Jason Leigh and focused entirely on the music. How to please everyone? The end result is uneven but there's enough here to keep all parties interested.

If any actor should be singled out, it should be Harry Belafonte. His turn as the underworld kingpin, Seldom Seen, is fantastic. He speaks in a low, gruff rasp but his dialogue is truly worth the effort to understand. When he goes off on the Marcus Garvey speech, its worth the price of admission. Of course, it helps to know who Marcus Garvey was. Jazz fans (and reggae fans, too) will get it. After all, this is a movie for them/us."

Before Roman Holiday, I had never seen an Audrey Hepburn film, and I have to say that I am becoming more and more of a fan of her's. She was so beautiful and very talented, not to mention she seemed like a very classy and elegant lady. But the film itself was a pretty good one, this was the movie that made romantic comedy clich√©s, so that's why I let it go so easily. It seemed like this film had what a lot of romantic comedy films steal now a days.

Holly is a huge socialite in her grand world, she finds happiness and joy in the jewelery store, Tiffany's. She is also being paid 100 dollars to visit a drug Mafia leader in prison to make his day. But things begin to change when a very handsome man moves in down stairs from her, Paul, but she calls him Fred since he looks like her brother. He's also in a similar situation where his ""Decorator"" is paying him for a good time. But together they find themselves helping one another and realizing they may need each other.

Breakfast at Tiffany's is an elegant classic that I would rate up with Seven Year Itch starring Marilyn Monroe. It has great humor and sizzling romance that anyone could fall in love with. Audrey Hepburn took on a role which the character could have been neuritic and annoying, but she made Holly into someone every woman would like to be. Her and George were great together, I would highly recommend Breakfast at Tiffany's, it's a great classic.

To this day it still has many fans, which is a surprise for a movie this old.

The sceneries/backgrounds and special effects don't impress by today's standards, but they must have caused great impact back in 1939. Plus, some of the special effects are astonishing for the time. Look at that tornado, for example! It just seems so real! Amazing that they could do something like that in such primitive times.

Speaking of the sceneries, they are full of creative and details which create this childish world of fantasy (the land of Oz). Looking at all those sceneries and to what people dress, it almost reminds me about those childish theater plays I used to see during my childhood. The yellow brick road and the Emerald City are just two among many creative and imaginative details of this movie.

The characters are as original as much as they are odd and unusual. The most bizarre characters are the army of flying monkeys, the Winkie Guards, the Wicked Witch of the East, the Munchkins, the talking trees and the Gatekeeper. The Scarecrow, the Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion are less weird, but still unusual. Dorothy and her cute dog Toto, Professor Marvel, Hunk, Zeke, Hickory, Auntie Em, Uncle Henry and the Wizard of Oz are normal characters.

Of all the 3 strange friends of Dorothy, the Scarecrow is my favorite. He is the funniest of them, even though the silly Cowardly Lion is hilarious.

To a degree, I can see why this movie is considered a classic. It consistently appears in the lists of the greatest movies ever. It is much praised and regarded by many people. It gets generally high ratings. Does it really deserve to be as venerated as it is? Well, it's all a matter of tastes. But despite its charm and magic, there are things of discussable taste in this movie, such as the bizarre characters which become tiring after many viewings. Certain scenes are also somewhat dark and sinister for a kids's movie.

The songs are simple but jolly and charming, such as ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"", ""We're Off to See the Wizard"", ""If I Only Had a Brain"" (in this last case, including its related songs) and my favorite: the wonderful opening music. I don't like the songs sung by the Munchkins because of their weird voices.

Although the movie is beyond dated and obsolete nowadays, it was nevertheless advanced for its time, thanks to the special effects and the fact that it is a sepia-toned black-and-white film in the Kansas sequences and a fully colored one (Technicolor) in the Oz sequences.

The actors are generally good in their roles. The best are Frank Morgan (who portrays a total of 5 roles in the film), Ray Bolger (as the Scarecrow and Hunk) and Judy Garland (as Dorothy Gale).

Filming was a nightmare. And yet the movie would become a lasting legacy, even though that was uncertain at the time."

134,Citizen Kane (1941),01-Jan-1941,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," Okay. First of all, I DO like many old movies. 12 angry men, Casablanca, Where Eagles Dare, Psycho, The Treasure of Sierra Madre, The Great Dictator, Some Like it Hot and more. They're all brilliant and I enjoyed them throughout.

But Citizen Kane...I just can't see what's so great about it. It made no impression on me whatsoever. When it comes to plot, camera-angles, themes, characters, acting and such, it seems like few movies are as praised as this. Still, when I read reviews on other classics, for example Casablanca, it feels like they say many of the same things.

I'm not an expert on what makes some films objectively better than others, but if the other classics with most of the other ""greatnesses"" actually ARE interesting and fun to watch, then Citizen Kane should also be able to entertain as well as just being ""great"".

You can say what you want about movies, but no matter how well they're made, they should also entertain in some way or another to be classified as great. And I'm not one of those guys who only like action movies. An example of a great movie is Requiem for a Dream. It's disturbing, repulsive and scary as h*ll, but I couldn't keep my eyes from it, and it made a brutal impression. Other examples of movies that are deep, makes an impression AND are entertaining could be One flew over the Cuckoos Nest, The Visitor, American Beauty and Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind.

But entertainment isn't all. I see that. If Citizen Kane had made an impression it wouldn't fail no matter how uninteresting. Taxi Driver is another movie I bored me through, and don't want to see again, but still I find it good because I couldn't stop thinking about it afterwards. It made an impression. Citizen Kane doesn't do that either.

And to all you die-hard-fans who hate me, wants to disgrace me, and finds it horrendous to call a classic ""not entertaining"" I'll just quote the great Ingmar Bergman: ""Citizen Kane is a total bore!"" To call me retarded or something like that would be to call one of the greatest directors of all time the same. In addition it's clear that many more agree as well. It's not long since the feature was in the top 3 on IMDb. Today it's number 29.

So all in all, I may not know how to judge objective qualities of movies, but I'm certain that movies that doesn't leave any impression whatsoever AND isn't entertaining at all aren't great no matter what. And that's why ""the greatest movie ever made"" fails for me. 3/10"
135,2001: A Space Odyssey (1968),01-Jan-1968,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,"['Drama', 'Mystery', 'Sci-Fi', 'Thriller']",
136,Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939),01-Jan-1939,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," Critics of ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" will call it cheesy, saccharine, and over-the-top in its character portrayals. Truth be told, I really can't call those critiques ""wrong"". But the thing is, this is such an endearing, aspirational film that I'm always able to look past the cheese-factor and enjoy the performances and overall message.

For a very basic overview, 'Mr. Smith Goes To Washington"" tells the story of Jefferson Smith (James Stewart), a wide-eyed, aww-shucks, country boy rube who gets nominated for a U. S. Senate seat in large part to be a straight-ticket voter for the political machine of Senator Joseph Paine (Claude Rains). Once in Washington, however, both get a rude awakening: Smith discovers the graft in politics, while Paine begins to realize--to his horror--that Smith isn't just going to ""tow the party line"".

This movie remains an all-time classic for me because of the earnestness of its message. It isn't quite as perfect as Capra's more famous ""It's A Wonderful Life"", but I do see similarities between the two pictures. Here, the story strikes such a simple--yet highly emotional--chord. Though deep down I think we all realize that corruption and compromise are likely unavoidable aspects of politics, we like to cling to ideals of honesty and supreme integrity. That is precisely the journey that Smith takes viewers on. This isn't ""politics as it is"", but rather ""politics as we want it to be"", and I think there is equal room for both in politically-minded films.

Of course, casting Stewart is the cherry on top of all this. I'm not sure there has been a better individual born to play the Jefferson Smith role. His stuttering, stammering, ""golly gee whiz"" routine is perfect, yet when the chips are down he delivers a filibuster monologue almost guaranteed to have you in tears. Rains is fine as the corrupt Senator and Jean Arthur has a nice sidekick supporting role, but ""Mr. Smith Goes To Washington"" is memorable because of Stewart. I very much liken his performance here to that of Henry Fonda's in ""12 Angry Men"". It's what we all wish we could be like--but know we'll probably never quite get there.

The only reason I can't give this a full 10 stars? It was made in 1939--or back when Hollywood didn't really know how to properly end movies other than an emotional flourish and a fade to black. With a less-rushed, more nuanced endgame, this one could have ascended even higher.

Overall, though, I consider this to be one of my favorite political films of all time. Make all the gritty, tough governmental thrillers you want (I love some of those too!), but I hold steady that a more aspirational, positive-minded effort like this isn't out-of-date or irrelevant simply because of that nature."
137,Big Night (1996),20-Sep-1996,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," When the British film magazine Sight & Sound had one of their periodic times of asking critics to list what they thought were the best films ever made, there was a book which collected articles by several of them, one of whom said that if you were the type of person who didn't tear up at THE BELLS OF ST. MARY'S, he didn't want to know you. I try to avoid that philosophy, but if I endorsed it, BIG NIGHT would be that type of film for me, a litmus test. This is a wonderful movie, and I usually am not a big fan of food movies. I thought BABETTE'S FEAST was too full of whimsy, and whimsy also bogged down the often good TAMPOPO(EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN, it could be argued, was a relationship movie which happened to be set in the world of food, where the others are inextricably food movies). But this was wonderful.

Tucci and Scott said they studied a lot of film masters, and it shows here; there's nothing that screams ""first film."" Instead, they take their time telling the story, and setting up characters we care about, even Pascal, the rival restaurant owner. And a lesser movie wouldn't have had the scene between Isabella Rosellini and Minnie Driver which is quiet yet moving, like the rest of the movie. The food scenes live up to the hype, and that final scene is moving."

There are too many things in this one to comment on, but I'd like to go through a couple. First of all, weren't they the Junior National Team in the second one? And didn't they win the Junior Olympics? They weren't even one of those regional JO teams people play on, they were supposedly the entire U.S. So how come only one of them plays varsity? It's like, ""you may have been in the olympics, but this is high school hockey, and we're varsity, we're better than olympics"". If the varsity guys are so good, why weren't they olympics? Secondly, are they really freshmen? If I remember correctly, at the end one of them is kissing an upperclassman cheerleader. And there's no one some of them are freshmen. Third, high schools don't recruit entire teams, and close tryouts to no other freshmen than those on that team. It's against the rules. The only people that tried out were the Ducks and ""varsity"". Another thing, where's the Junior Varsity team? Schools don't do just Freshman and Varsity. Fourth, so many people are missing from the first movie. Danny Tamberelli's character and his sister were only in one movie. The brothers are gone, Jesse in the first two and Terry only in the first. The chunky kid and his dark-haired friend who always wore a hat were only in the first.

He only deals in the luxury end of the market, so ""Jim"" (Dean Jones) is a bit surprised to find a dilapidated old VW Beetle in his yard. There's something very special about this little car, and soon the down-on-his-luck driver and his mate ""Tennessee"" (Buddy Hackett) have bought him, repaired him and named him ""Herbie"".

It's interesting that this was released one year after ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" (1968) - so clearly the theme of magical cars was popular. ""Herbie"" is mischievous and not averse too the odd tantrum which gives him just enough of a personality, coupled with an on form Jones - to create an enjoyable tale of friendship and inter-reliance as well as one of fast-paced antics and even the slightest hint of romance as we tumble down mountains, slide in and out of mud and generally have our own sort of ""Whacky Race"". It's a bit over-scripted and probably twenty minutes too long - I think we all get the gist and could be getting on with the action a bit more quickly, but it's still a decent watch that reminds us of what was hugely popular in the late sixties."

Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey, the 1993 feature by director Duwayne Dunham was not plagued by some of the common problems in talking animal movies. The two dogs and a cat who make the incredible journey to find the owners they think have abandoned them, are well-written and given interesting enough personalities for the audience to get engaged in their stories and sit at attention with them until the very end. Setting out to find their owners and the only home they've ever known, the animals learn a lot about love and comradery along the way.

Life is good for Shadow (Don Ameche), Chance (Michael J. Fox), and Sassy (Sally Field). Both dogs and the cat are cared for and loved incessantly by their wonderful attentive owners. After their owners marry and their family grows, something unusual happens. They notice a lot of suitcases and they go to a strange place. Unbeknownst to them, Bob Seaver (Robert Hays) has gotten a researching job in San Francisco and will be temporarily locating the family there until his project is done. Leaving the animals at a friend of their female owner's, the family leaves with promises misunderstood by the animals of returning for visits. Perplexed at their loving owner's abandonment, Shadow is convinced a mistake has been made and encourages the dogs to follow him in an attempt to find their owners. Traversing the rough and wild terrain proves more than the animals anticipated, and soon wonder if they will be safe and loved ever again.

The visuals in Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey were strikingly captivating, much grander and more beautiful than I expected from a children's movie. The establishment shots in the beginning especially, were breathtaking capturing the true wilderness the animals would have to endure. Watching a family movie, one expects a decent amount of clean packaging, which did occur in Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey, it is easily forgiven however because the creatures were so well-written. It was fun to follow along with the main characters despite them not being human. Talking animal films are usually in a class by themselves as far as cheesiness. Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey doesn't suffer from such cheese, however. I believe, a large reason why Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey is so tolerable is because the animals mouths don't move in sync with their dialogue. I always thought that the synced mouth movements and dialogue was a peculiar choice for filmmakers of talking animal movies. The decision makes it no more believable that animals are actually talking simply because their mouths move like human's when they speak. A few brilliant filmmaking decisions, a beautifully shot film, and a perfect ending scene make Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey the perfect film from one's childhood with their own blossoming families."

True, James Mason was the man fate intended for the role of Nemo, and the Nautilus was design perfection.

However, I would like to point out one thing. Once again, Hollywood pisses on literature by tearing away the subtlety of the book and changing all the things that fascinate about the story. Jules Verne's Nemo was a mystery - nothing is ever found out by Aronnax or his associates about this enigmatic figure. Yet Disney goes further than to even suggest his past, it becomes integral to the plot.

The beauty of Verne's work is that it is scientific intrigue set against human struggle, yet this version does not do the novel the justice of presenting this as an important side. Not to mention that the emphasis is shifted from Aronnax to the questionable comic duo of Conseil (about as different from Verne's character as it is possible to be) and Land.

Rawlins siblings Charlie, Carrie, and Paul join the mass evacuation of London children to the countryside. Miss Eglantine Price (Angela Lansbury) reluctantly agrees to take in the kids temporarily. She lives in a remote farm. She's overjoyed to receive a broom and become an apprentice witch from the Emelius Browne Correspondence College of Witchcraft. She casts a spell on a bedknob for Paul to make the bed transport vast distances. The school announces its closure and Miss Price takes the kids to London to find Emelius (David Tomlinson). He's surprised that his adaptation of an old spell book actually worked for her. It's high adventure to the animated animal island of Naboombu and then a fight against the Nazis.

This is sorta like Mary Poppins but not quite as good. Angela Lansbury is good but she's no Julie Andrews. The songs are not quite as catchy. It's even got the similar animated world for the actors to play with. I can do without the Nazis in a kids movie. This is certainly not too soon but it's still questionable to have a Nazi battle, no matter how comedic, in a family film."

Second, the acting is absolutely horrid across the board (Alan Rickman excepted). Willis and Bedelia are bland and listless, and have zero chemistry. Also why are American and British actors cast to play Germans? Their accents are hilarious. The only real German here is Andreas Wisniewski, who is completely wasted in a bit part; a far cry from his memorable turn in ""Living Daylights"" (a film that easily blows this one out of the water).

And finally the slew of plot holes and contrivances which require the hero not to be extremely smart but the villians to be extremely dumb.

Some of the writing is pretty good. The direction was hammy, but at least the tone is managed well, over-all. Dr. Angelo's character is given a little berth to pass off as a realistic character; this invites us to identify with him as a ""voice of reason"" in a cartoonish sci-fi universe.

Of course, the whole thing uses the misunderstood tech trope of the year, ""virtual reality"", boosted by mind-altering drugs, as a hook for yet-another story about man's effort to cosmically transcend. This is a strained notion, as any technically savvy dude or dudette knows. So the whole thing rides on a willing suspension of disbelief. The question remains whether this act of suspension rewards us with a sustainable, ennobling myth.

Well, my attempt to give the flick a slight jolt by voting it a '7' is an indicator. The flick is surely dated, but not bad for its time. Where the story fails to fully ennoble, it at least maintains a sense of momentum; I found it quite watchable.

At the very least, it worth watching as a heroic effort by the producers to mythically bend new (at the time) tech toward a moral fable about humankind's perennial tech hubris expressed as yet-another effort to bite off more than can reasonably be chewed.

I was particularly struck by an interesting form taken by the usual story-management effort to keep Dr. Angelo's karma clean: That the dosing of his human subject with the ""next-stage"" experimental drugs was effected without his knowledge, via subterfuge by admins; not by the researcher (Angelo) himself. Very clever plot point, that!

Anyway. It's not a great flick, but may be worth watching as a kind of worthy period piece. It's a bit of an aesthetic casualty of the 'B'-flick hewings of production folks of the time: If you factor that out, you can see the glimmerings of decent sci-fi."

They're all excellent actors with tremendous talent - they all shine in this spectacular comedy. One of the most memorable scenes is when Monica (Marisa Tomei) swears openly to her ""date"" on the phone with her son J.J. (Jake Lloyd) a few feet away at the dinner table during Thanksgiving (check out the dinner). I mean, what would a movie starring Marisa Tomei be like without having her saying ""f***"" in it? Honestly. And what about Gerard....how can you not get hungry watching his movies - the man and food, I don't know. He did, of course, a great job as a French-Canadian truck driver. Then there's Jake Lloyd. Does this kid ever not give an excellent performance? I mean really. He shines as sweet little J.J. Also look for other great performances by Moira Kelly, David Thornton, and Bridgette Wilson. Great cast overall. This film was well worth the purchase and just cries out for multiple viewings. However Cyndi Lauper's theme song is terrible. But of course R.E.M.'s ""Country Feedback"" is always welcome. Terrific film."

Lots of action, lots of great dialogue (e.g. fun to quote), a little intrigue, and stuff blowing up all over the place. Samuel L Jackson and Geena Davis had great chemistry. Violent, but not gory. The fact that the female part was the competent action lead is a pleasant turn-about.

Have seen the movie more than a dozen times and still enjoy it enough to put it back in my favorite films rotation every 3 or 4 months.

Stan Winston, one of the best special-effects men in the business, lent his talents to this film while Val Kilmer and Michael Douglas are more than adequate in the starring roles and the African with the freckles (sorry, I don't have his name) is really a likeble fellow.

Except for the first one, the lion attack scenes are not gruesome and the filmmakers did a nice job a having just the right amount of action and lulls. Neither is overdone. This film has never been given much due but I've never shown it to anyone who didn't thoroughly enjoy it.

149,Jude (1996),01-Nov-1996,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," Thomas Hardy's Jude the Obscure is a very complicated and ambitious book, and while heavy-reading it is a fine piece of literature. This 1996 film adaptation is a rock-solid adaptation, that is ambitious and realistic. I will admit some parts like the killing of the pig is anything but tender, but none of the scenes are over-sensationalised.

As an adaptation of the book, it works very well. If I had a quibble, the secondary characters could have been developed more than they were depicted. The screenplay is well crafted; the writers and the director have at least some idea how Hardy's work should work on film and stay relatively true to the book. The music both haunting and beautiful at the same time was absolutely outstanding.

The direction is very fine, never sluggish and never overdone. It was about right. The cinematography is superb, dark, fluid and sensitive. And the period detail was just as good. It was this element alone that contributed to the mood of the adaptation. The love story here which is dirty and tragic was beautifully realised, and very rarely struck a false note.

The performances were just brilliant, no overplaying or underplaying as far as I could see. Special mention must go to the two lead performances. Christopher Ecceleston is a very talented and I think under-appreciated actor, and in the title role he was perfectly cast and showed real versatility. As Sue Brideshead, the beautiful Kate Winslet is positively luminous and is true to her character. Out of the supporting performances, the best is Rachel Griffiths as Arabella, a very modest performance I must say.

Overall, has its minor flaws but a very well done adaptation of a complicated book. Always realistic and never overly-sentimental as I feared. Though the ending is heart-rending. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

This is exactly what a guy like my age should see. This is a great guys movie. Swingers is a label which you can call bunch of guys hanging out and flirting with chicks. They have a very high self-esteem and big mouths. And they look stylish. And they are. They're swinging.

The story here concentrates on Mikey (Jon Favreau) who's having a difficulties to get over with a broken relationship. His friends try to help him. And there comes a lesson. It shows how important is to have a real friends around you. It's great to see that. The bunch of comedians (Jon Favreau, Vince Vaughn, Ron Livingston) are young here. And they offer more than one or two humorous scene.

So if you're a guy over 20, you should see that movie. According to Trent (Vince Vaughn) 'you are so money that you don't know that'. He keeps telling that to Mikey (Jon Favreau) all the time and probably he has right. Well, I say that the film is money and I have probably right too."

Forget the images that come with the movie, your imagination conjures up visions way beyond the limits of any special effects!

But still, not a bad version of the book. The actors are all adequate, but Gene Wilder is fantastic, the best thing about the movie - he was the only aspect in the movie which was at least as good as what I envisioned while reading the book, if not better. And watch out for the twinkle in his his eyes! :)

This is also one of those movies where knowing the story beforehand doesn't really do much damage when you actually watch it, if anything you anticipate what happens.

Really the only thing to criticize - is that the movie isn't as good as our own imaginations. The other criticisms just make me laugh. Granted the special effects aren't that cutting-edge, but hey, this was made years ago and it's OK considering! Also I don't really feel it's too 'scary' for kids... I know lots of children who think that Roald Dahl's stuff are cool, and no, they don't grow up to become mass murderers. And true, there is a dark side to it, but it's got a good message to send. If anyone got traumatized, they probably grew up like a glass bubble. I'm not a kid anymore and I do still know how to enjoy it, perhaps it's even more amusing because you really get to appreciate the intelligence of the absurdity and the fun of the exaggerations that Dahl inevitably dishes out. It's silly, but perhaps that's why you love it.

Another thing ... really interesting to watch out for if you're familiar with the great works of Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde etc ... I haven't read all, but enough to catch some of the quotes from their works deliciously sneaked into the dialogue here. For example, ""Parting is such a sweet sorrow"" from Romeo and Juliet by Shakespeare, and ""The suspense is terrible. I hope it lasts"" from The Importance of Being Earnest by Wilde, among others.

I especially love one of the last lines in the movie where Dahl shows his total ability for sweet innocence (and Wilder delivers it to perfection) when Wonka tells Charlie, ""And Charlie: don't forget what happened to the man who suddenly got everything he'd ever wished for."" and Charlie asks, ""What happened?"" and this is when you're sure that he's gonna give you one of those righteous, cautionary, adult message of the preachy kind when he says, magically, ""He lived happily ever after."" *sigh* ..."

Already with this one, he began his vast exploration of movie techniques and devices that would last 25 years or so.

The idea is simple in this one: he wanted to use film slapstick from a bygone era. How better to situate that than to move the whole picture into a future era?

We have some truly classic stuff here. The banana joke, The mirror joke. The robot pantomime. The acting out of the Jewish dinner (done in later movies too). The inflated man joke. You can find all these in any number of Keaton. Marx, Laurel & Hardy movies.

The unifying string of time travel, a romance, the leader and his nose is too weak to make this a solidly recommended outing. And it wouldn't be for a couple years until Woody cared about the cinematography at all.

Sexually absurd, yet attractive and stimulating. Jamie Lee Curtis' vulgar femme fatale has done the job. Charles Crichton's heist comedy is not a pure family film; rather, it's vulgar and sexually absurd. The maverick and no-limit femme character of Jamie will stimulate you as a viewer, especially male audiences. There are some loopholes in the script that need a little attention, but that's alright as long as the gags keep coming. Nevertheless, there are a few issues with the film that I'll disclose in brief. A Fish Called Wanda revolves around a robbery, and there is a girl as the central character who traps three men in her sexual desires for the diamonds. Her lover is arrested after being tipped off by her brother (and her), but he was smart enough to hide the treasure before going behind bars. Well, the girl also has a sexual relationship with her brother, who speaks Italian and stimulates her. ""Even if you are my brother, I still want to F you,"" she says (that's absurd and rubbish, though). Then she traps a married barrister so that she can get him to talk about the treasure once her lover is sentenced to jail. This part is damn funny and sexually attractive, but seriously, how can you have a well-educated barrister with an IQ level of a KG student? Her ideas are simple yet are never challenged by any male characters-that's what hurts the most about the script. In one scene, the barrister is caught nude by tenants, who apparently know him already, but did that cause any alarm about his identity and personal life? No. That's childish. And wait a second, why didn't they catch the girl who was right there, upside the stairs? Jamie's sex appeal has covered many loopholes, and this fishing tale manages to trap the audience. Overall, a fantastic sex comedy with an outdated femme fatale touch.

RATING - 7/10*

This lamebrained, terribly scripted, terribly constructed, terribly acted movie is your ""Favorite Movie of All Time?""

This is the movie that made me avoid ""Ghost"" for over a year (definitely a mistake), because after seeing this, I incorrectly assumed that anything with Patrick Swayze in it was just going to be BAD.

The story's been told before (repeatedly, I might add). Even if the story hadn't been told before, every aspect of the movie is completely predictable. Most of the dialogue is more laughable than most spoofs of ""Star Trek"" (at least when those people are spoofing Shatner as Kirk, they're ""trying"" to be funny). And the acting--ugh, even if the dialogue wasn't so bad, most of the principals are so wooden you could use them as surfboards.

The dancing scenes--okay, they were pretty good. But unless you're Kelly, Astaire, or Rogers, dance scenes do not a good movie make.

I can see people being entertained by this movie. I really can (just not me). But to call it your favorite movie of all time? AAAARRRRGGGHHHH!"

I am not kidding...think twice before you decide to watch it and for heaven's sake, DON'T LET KIDS SEE THIS FILM.

Now, despite this intense warning, I greatly respect the film--especially since it was made for next to nothing and without the big studio money. Despite its violence, the film is very smartly written, directed and acted. Quentin Tarantino was able to assemble a rather amazing cast of bad-boy actors--and in many, many ways is a modern version of film noir. And, to give the film that cache, he managed to get a great noir character actor, Lawrence Tierney (in real life a total nut) to give the film an air of menace and class.

Because so much on IMDb has already been written about this film and because it's in the IMDb Top 250, there just isn't a great need to discuss the film at length. Suffice to say that it is bloody, full of obscenities and extreme violence (though, to his credit, Tarantino did on many occasions make the actual violence occur off-camera). And, it's brilliant--with a great ending (full of vagueness and a noir-like downbeat ending) and is sure to please the right audience."

The premise--two wacky guys try to pretend their dead boss is not only still alive, but still the life of the party--may sound like it has potential on paper. But once the title character dies we suddenly realize that there is not much more you can do with a dead body than carry it around, move its head back and forth, wave its arms in the air, and so on. And that's exactly what happens here. For about an hour and a half.

Andrew McCarthy shows some genuine talent playing the smarmy smooth-operator Larry, and Jonathan Silverman is equally adept as Larry's straight-arrow buddy, Richard. Even Terry Kiser is about as good at playing a dead guy as anyone could hope for. But in the end, this is a physical comedy, an action-oriented film, and the only action possible is for McCarthy and Silverman to carry a limp Kiser around while attempting to make funny remarks about what they are doing. Excessive performances by other characters, particularly the party-goers and mob killer, only serve to remind us that this is the comedic equivalent of a melodrama that has no plot.

Perhaps with a more intelligent screenplay and a little less reliance on physical comedy Weekend at Bernie's could have had potential."

That is exactly what Catherine Tremell does. She exudes sex and that is exactly her game. She knows that she can play with people's minds by using her beauty and her sex appeal. And she does it so well.

The epitome of this is the interrogation scene. Much has been made about nudity in film but this is one of those movies where every breast and every shot of someone's crotch is done so to further the plot. The famous scene that we have all witnessed now is a major part of Tremell's M.O. She knows there are a room full of men asking her questions and she uses that sexuality to play with them. And it works.

The cast and the script and the direction are top notch and the movie feels like it is one big game. And Catherine Tremell is the ultimate game master. I really loved this film and I rate it a perfect ten."

The life of a salesman is tough and by the looks of it, the life of a property salesman is the absolute pits. I've never had much sympathy for the likes of salespersons; they badger you, they interrupt your day, and they lie.

I remember when I bought a Kirby vacuum from a door-to-door salesman. He sold my wife on it so I come home and I'm $1800 poorer. They gave us a contract that was 18 months 0%. Well, the bank called and said, ""So, we have a contract here for 12 months 0%.""

I said, ""No. It's 18 months 0%.""

The bank said, ""We don't do 18 month 0% contracts.""

I said, ""Then void it and come get your vacuum.""

Ricky (Al Pacino), Shelley (Jack Lemmon), George (Alan Arkin), and Dave (Ed Harris) were in the business of selling property for Premiere Properties, a hole in the wall company in New York. They would do anything to make a sell--and who wouldn't if you depended on it to eat everyday. They are good salesmen, even if they *ahem* bend the truth a little bit, but even a good salesperson needs good leads.

I think they said the word ""lead"" about 100 times in the span of an hour and 40 minutes. They wanted the good leads and didn't want the old stale leads. It was a miserable existence.

I think the cast of ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" made the matter of property sales about as interesting as could be. The topic itself is not that enthralling, so to make a movie about it in which the audience doesn't go to sleep is admirable. I think all the performances were great, with Jack Lemmon and Pacino being the best. Did I ever feel sorry for them. I'm still shutting down any salesman that tries to pitch me, but I do feel sorry for them."

The obvious thing was the co-starring of two generations of Fondas. I understand that Henry Fonda and Jane Fonda hadn't been on the best terms due to her political activism in the '60s, and so this movie was a sort of reconciliation for both of them.

As for the plot, the movie comes across as a ""nice movie"" that you can take the kids to see. Katharine Hepburn's ""knight in shining armor"" quote pretty much sums up the movie's feeling. I'm not saying that it's a bad movie, just a little too fluffy. It's a surprise seeing Jane Fonda and Dabney Coleman play wife and husband, since they had just played enemies in ""9 to 5"".

Basically, it's a watchable movie, but not any sort of masterpiece. Probably worth seeing once. So strange to think that Henry Fonda won an Academy Award for the role and died a few months later."

In France, Chief Insp. Charles Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) suspends bumbling policeman Jacques Clouseau (Peter Sellers) for six months. The commissioner orders Dreyfus to reinstate Clouseau to be sent to Lugash to investigate the theft. Lady Claudine Litton claims that the Phantom is the only one capable of the crime but her husband Sir Charles Litton (Christopher Plummer) maintains his innocence. He decides to catch the thief to clear his name.

Dreyfus and Clouseau remain one of the great comedic pairing. Their early back and forth is absolutely hilarious. Dreyfus is missed as Clouseau sets off alone. They are better together. It takes too long for both Dreyfus and Cato to reunite with Clouseau. Those two have the potential to pump up the slapstick comedy. I love the smaller bits of sly humor like the local who knows the location of the hotel and simply continues to walk away. It is gloriously dead-pan. There is the iconic Clouseau falling backwards into the pool following the bikini girl. This movie is full of great physical humor. I doubt the plot actually matters."

Besides the ""usual"" ingredients of excitement, characterization and great narrative technique, the movie really scores on the wonder factor. The amazing, jellyfish-like aliens and their manipulation of water... A superb story incorporating the use of a then-recent SFX breakthrough to absolute perfection. A timeless story with great actors, great characters, great emotional substance.

The story is fabulous. It is about the very survival of humanity, drawing on that time-honored science fiction trope: will we be so stupid and disorganized that we cause our own destruction, or will love and reason prevail, inaugurating a great and harmonious future for our species? In thinly veiled symbol terms, this movie demonstrates how we will reach the brink of destruction due to our own folly, but can be redeemed if we rediscover the love and wonder that we once lost.

He doesn't divulge his cunning plan until he is ready, and then presents the man with some perfectly cultivated carnations. It turns out there's money in flowers, but they also need a great deal of water. Gallons and gallons of the stuff. It occurs to ""Papet"" that their curmudgeonly neighbour might be willing to sell his land, upon which there is a clogged-up spring. No such luck there but an accident shortly afterwards fills them with hope. Sadly for them, their plans are further frustrated by the arrival of the hunch-backed and enthusiastic city boy ""Jean"" (G√©rard Depardieu) and his wife and child who move onto the farm. They are decent and hard-working relatives of the dead man and are determined to use science to make a go of things. Whilst feigning friendship with the family, ""Ugolin"" and ""Papet"" cement over their water supply and leave them at the mercy of the unpredictable weather and a rather ropey cistern system. Their farming days would appear to be doomed unless God intervenes. What now ensues sees the family ""Cadoret"" increasingly struggle to make money breeding rabbits and growing fruit and vegetables - amidst the mother of all heatwaves, as their cognisant neighbours look on unwilling to point out that their salvation is buried but yards away. Will the cynical ploy of the ""Soubeyran"" clan prevail? There's a great cast doing the work here, with Auteuil especially effective as the slightly conflicted nephew who doesn't always come across as the full shilling; Montand as the calculating, dynastically motivated, manipulator and finally a great effort from Depardieu who manages to portray a man plumbing the depths of despair - whilst always seemingly open to a degree of optimism and hope, really compellingly. The drama is peppered with loads of earthy humour and the small town setting provides for many of the usual characterisations of village life that is sceptical of, if not downright hostile to, new arrivals.

I remember first seeing this movie in the theater 30 years ago and being mildly amused by Judy and Company. I should have left it at that.

While camped-out at a friend's horse ranch, I found the movie on VHS and decided for a trip down memory lane. Big mistake. How this over-rated comedy ever became nominated for THREE Oscars baffles me to no end. Guess it was a SLOW year for comedy in 1980.

The screenplay and acting is on the same level as a bad sit-com. The acting is cardboard and sophomoric. The plot? Beyond simplistic. The entire package presented couldn't suspend the disbelief of present-day 12 year old.

Just a pile of disorganized fluff that never should have made the big screen but should have been adequate for a made-for-TV-movie now long forgotten and mercifully so."

You understand where Travolta is coming from, and the whole debacle really intensifies after what is really an accident...he's trying to get his old boss (who had to pay him off) to listen to him, and while waving his shotgun about (only to emphasis his point), he acccidentaly shoots the remaining guard in the chest!

I don't really care for Hoffman and actually frowned on his flirting with his young assistant, nothing sinister - I just don't think he's attractive enough to carry it off - sorry.

Good film though, and a reasonably unexpected ending......

Above average 6 out of 10."
340,Boogie Nights (1997),01-Jan-1997,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," The three names that mean the most to this film are Burt Reynolds, Mark Wahlberg, and Julianne Moore. These three deliver the strongest performances, but the entire cast does a wonderful job. The film although about the porn industry does not let itself get out of hand with it's own sexual premise. On the other hand there were many scenes that involved drug use and although important to understanding the characters lifestyle, I think there was some overkill in this department. Paul Thomas Anderson has not done a great deal of directing, but he may have been picked for this film based on his 1988 work ""The Dirk Diggler Story."" One thing that was brilliantly portrayed is the family like atmosphere between the characters as they work, live, and party together. Although not a typical family they certainly seem to care for each other. The wonderful soundtrack really helps give you a feel for the period during a time when disco was the rage. There are many disco favorites on it and some other wonderful songs as well.

The story is about a gifted young man named Eddie Adams (Wahlberg) that gets invited into the porn industry. He changes his name to Dirk Diggler and becomes and adult film star almost overnight. Jack Horner (Reynolds) is the director that takes his films very seriously as he believes his work is more than just pornography, but that they are true art. However Dirk becomes overly dependent on drugs and soon heads down a dangerous road where he stands to loose everything. Although a greater focus is placed on the character Dirk there are subplots for the other characters and their trials in life. You will find yourself wishing for and hoping their situations improve. All-in-all a well done film."
341,Critical Care (1997),01-Jan-1997,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Comedy']," Sidney Lumet shows why he is a unique voice in the American cinema with his take on the state of medicine in this country. Mr. Lumet, working on the screen play by Steven Schwartz, based on Richard Dooling's excellent book, presents us a story about what's wrong with our health care system. His acerbic take on the way some physicians conduct themselves goes underneath the surface as he explores what happens when there's a complication as a young doctor is drawn into a family drama that involves the hospital where he is an intern.

If you haven't seen the film, maybe you would like to stop reading.

We are taken to an new intensive care unit of a big hospital. Everything is so impersonal that one doesn't get any feeling of warmth in the way the people are seen in their beds, as they are being treated from different ailments. Young doctor Ernst is an intern assigned to that area. He shows signs of fatigue because of his long hours on duty.

Our attention is directed to the patient on Bed 5, an older man who is comatose. His younger daughter, dressed to the nines, comes to pay a visit that seems more of an excuse to flirt with the doctor, rather than her concern about the state of her own father who doesn't show any signs of life. Dr. Ernst is dazzled by the beautiful Felicia. When he asks her to go to dinner, she accepts all too readily.

At the same time we are introduced to the head nurse of that area, Stella, a woman who has seen suffering and death frequently. She goes to assist Bed 2, a young black man who has a kidney problem. All this patient wants is to die. Who can blame him? His parents, on the other hand, have a different idea. This man is visited by a sinister figure who stands, as a devil figure. Stella wants to help, but she her hands are tied.

Young Dr. Ernst has his own troubles. He works for a doctor that keeps paging him, but when he goes to his office, the man, doesn't even remember calling him. This man is suffering from a loss of memory caused by his heavy drinking. Dr. Butz is the worst nightmare as the head of the department. All he cares is about if the patient has an insurance policy that will pay whatever he, and the hospital will demand. Bed 5, alone, has been billed for more than a hundred thousand dollars!

Dr. Werner Ernst in a moment of carelessness falls for Felicia's charms. Little does he knows that she is using him for her own greedy purposes. Felicia, and her sister Connie, are battling because of the clause in their Bed 5 father's will. A lot of money is at stake; each woman is fighting for it in their own dirty way. Dr. Ernst has an epiphany when the nun-like figure comes into Bed 5's room and confronts the doctor with some facts that resonate in the young doctor.

Finally, everything comes to a head as the two sisters bring law suits against the hospital. This is when the legal system comes into play. We see the ugly faces of all the different factions. In a great confrontation at the end of the film, we see all different lawyers and doctors as they prepare to fight. Dr. Ernst, in a daring moment gets the warring parties together.

James Spader, as Dr. Ernst, is nothing short of perfection. His take on this young intern, in the middle of the mess that has been created around him, is amazing. Helen Mirren, as Stella, the kind nurse makes another invaluable contribution to the film. Kyra Sedgwick, is Felicia, the pretty young daughter who doesn't care about the dying father. Margot Martindale plays Connie, the other sister. Jeffrey Wright is the patient Bed 2 in a great performance. The surprise of the film though, is Albert Brooks, whose Dr. Butz is one of the best characters of his career. The rest of the cast is first rate.

Sidney Lumet is to the congratulated for tackling this thorny issue about what's wrong in the country in the fields of medicine, law, and insurance."

343,Alien: Resurrection (1997),01-Jan-1997,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"['Action', 'Horror', 'Sci-Fi']"," Alien Resurrection was released about six months after I graduated from high school, and at the time I wasn't very familiar with the series. I took my first film class about six months later, at which point I learned to really appreciate the great films and filmmakers, and one of the first things I learned was that the first three Alien films are spectacular achievements of science fiction cinema and the third sequel is a sad, ridiculous mess. This happens all too often with sequels and yes, part four is not yet another amazingly impressive Alien film, but come on, it's not THAT bad.

I watched it last night for the first time in almost ten years, and was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. It's strange that I liked it so much, because it shows all the signs of a botched, modernized sequel of a series that should have been left alone long ago. The characters, most of all, are almost all goofy caricatures with preposterous dialogue and routine motivations, and some just don't belong at all. Personally I am a pretty big fan of Winona Ryder, but only in roles that suit her, and she has had a lengthy list of roles that suit her, but Annallee Call in Alien Resurrection is just not one of them. Too often she comes off as a tough talking teenager in this movie and it just gets hard to take her character seriously. She's like Ja Rule in Half Past Dead, but less ridiculous.

Then again, this could just have been a result of her starring alongside Sigourney Weaver, and that woman is just awesome. Dan Hedaya is suitably over-the-top in his role as the gleefully neurotic General Perez, and I have to admit that I was curious to see the performance of Gary Dourdan as Christie. Lately I've been watching countless hours of CSI on DVD, and it's amazing to see how different his role is in this movie from the most serious role he would play later in that show. I prefer the later performance, myself.

The resurrection implied in the title refers to Ripley being borough back to life 200 years after her death for the purpose of creating one of the alien queens, and then breeding the animals for twisted scientific purposes. They decide to keep Ripley alive for observation after surgically removing the alien from her chest, only to discover that she and the aliens are clearly more than they are prepared to handle. There is a negligible subplot involving a group of shady characters headed by the wonderfully sinister Michael Wincott as a Frank Elgyn, who promises his men won't start trouble or get into any fights if they are allowed to stay on board for a few days and nights.

I also have to mention Ron Perlman, who just has a face for this kind of movie. Probably most recognizable lately as Hellboy, this has to be one of the least appreciated actors of the last few decades. In just over 20 years he has acted in more than 150 films and TV shows, and at the time of this writing he has 18 projects in the works. Unbelievable! He also has one of the best lines in the movie (""Why the waste of ammo?! Must be a chick thing¬Ö"").

The aliens are probably the thing that will make or break this movie, and in my opinion they were impressive enough. The occasional CGI effects are never convincing, but then again they never are, so luckily they didn't overdo them. Even the aliens swimming underwater was not too much for me to accept, perhaps given the automatic tension that is immediately generated in almost any movie where someone has to hold their breath for a long time. This went on far too long to be anything remotely realistic in this movie, but it was a good scene nonetheless.

I would also argue that this is the goriest of all of the four alien movies, particularly at the end, but also contains some of the best comic relief. This combination makes the movie highly entertaining, even following in the long shadows of its spectacular predecessors. There is a high energy scene in the third act of the film where Perlman's character performs a daredevil stunt to shoot one of the pursuing aliens dead which is followed by what has to be the funniest spider killing in film history. I haven't laughed out loud like that at a movie in a long, long time.

In browsing through the posts on the message board for Resurrection I have been inspired to raise my rating for the movie from a 7 to an 8, if only because it is so obvious that everyone is jumping on the bandwagon about bashing this movie. I see nothing but whiny, pouting little brats whimpering and griping about little nitpicky details in the movie, condemning the third sequel in the Alien quadrilogy as a travesty and an embarrassment and a pathetic way to end the series.

Stupid people in large numbers, man. It's sad to see such a clear mob mentality slamming a movie that is about 100 times better than most people say. No, it's not up to the same level as the first two films and it definitely has its drawbacks, but it is definitely a good installment in the series, and you could certainly do a lot worse for some fun popcorn sci-fi on a Friday night. I'll admit that my judgment might be a little skewed because I watched the staggeringly awful Eaten Alive just before seeing this, but it is clear to me that Alien: Resurrection has yet to receive the respect it deserves."
344,"Apostle, The (1997)",18-Dec-1997,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," Written and directed by Roberty Duvall, I saw on entertainment T.V. in an interview that Robert even put millions of his own dollars into the 'making' of this. Propelling, is just the intro to this superbly crafted, story of doing the 'Gospel' your way. This shows me, many with good intentions can go almost terminally wrong.

I was sitting watching this on cable at the hotel, when my wife at that time, would not let me go out with her that morning on her route in Sierra Vista. It wasn't that I would get in the way of her talking to the doctors on her pharmaceutical rounds, due to the fact that she had already ask me to go with her a couple times before and I knew how things shake out with it, it was that she was having an affair with a co-worker and needed to give him a private long distance call, from a pay phone. At any rate, this was probably one of the most upending and unsettling and touching films I had seen in years. It was good that I stayed and watch Duvall's story of betrayal and violence. I came to a better grip with the circumstances that I was in, believe it or not. When he becomes E.F. the Apostle, you can see he seems starting to come apart, just before it happens. There is a much mis-gilded thought life that he has when he boldly steps up and decides that it's better to blame God than to 'take responsibility' for his very own misconduct and rage trouble. Farrah Fawcett provides an aging but provocative ex-wife that can't take the 'jambing' effect that Sonny seems to boldly posses. I.e. the baseball field assault on his ex's new man. It seems that at the end of the assault he just disconnected and said ""let's go home now."" As if whatever he does, even when totally wrong, he can justify to himself despite the damaged inflicted on anything, or anyone else that is around him then.

Then there is the scene at the church with Billy bob's character and they quickly end up in a brawl on the side of the church, while the deacons look on. But that was, what that character of Billy-Bob's needed to respect a man of God. A strong man. A wimp couldn't have probably reached him in the condition he was in right there.

I have a lot of respect for Robert Duvall for taking and making something that wouldn't get muddled by Hollywood and it's sense of God. It was different. I got quite a large helping of calm and understanding after my wife had departed our life together. I think I learned even more about human nature and intentions, motives etc. It shows that even when people mess it up, there is always something on a sub-textual level, it's not always just 'Face value'. I am not a Billy Bob fan by the way, but even his character, that came to destroy Sonny's church, and ended up changing his own life in that process. Remember as well, even if he can 'justify' his own bad behavior, God did not let him go on and on, he had to be brought to 'Justice' himself. You can mock God but only for a little while. This film, definitely touched me and caused me to think deeper.

345,Deconstructing Harry (1997),01-Jan-1997,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['Comedy', 'Drama']"," I think it's funny (but natural in a way) that people insist on reading Woody Allen films as autobiographical even when he insists they are not. I think it's especially funny with this film since Harry isn't really much like Allen at all.

This is kind of my problem with the film.

It's clear that Allen often comes up with ideas for films that loosely relate to his own life. This film deals with, among other things, the fact that being good at creating art that speaks to the human condition doesn't easily translate to being good at living among actual humans. I'm quite sure that resonates strongly with Allen.

But to turn this into a story, Allen creates this exaggerated Philip Roth-style novelist who drinks excessively, is extremely vulgar, and is a compulsive womanizer ... and since Allen plays this role people call the film ""extremely self-critical"". This character isn't Allen.

It's so much Allen that I just don't buy him in the role. Allen is a very self-consciously cerebral actor, and whenever he tries playing anything earthy, I completely reject him. I just do ... so very little of this film works for me. It's not a bad film ... in fact it's probably one of his better films of the 90's (which is not a very strong decade for him).

The weird staccato editing trick is a complete failure. Every time it happened I wanted to shout ""STOP!"" at the screen."

""Wag the Dog"" has a great premise that was prescient; before the film was released, President Clinton was involved in the sex scandal with Monica Lewinsky, and he threatened military action in Iraq. The really frightening thing is that in one of the clips shown in the film, a young woman wearing Monica's beret can be seen. It reminded me a little of the situation when Alfred Hitchcock was filming ""Notorious,"" and his Mcguffin was the uranium to make an atom bomb being hidden in wine bottles. It was entirely innocent on his part, but the FBI had him under surveillance for months wondering what he knew about the uranium stores in South America that actually existed..

Dustin Hoffman is Stanley Motss, the producer brought in by political adviser Conrad Bean (Robert DeNiro) to produce the war. Anne Heche plays a presidential aide, and the film also includes William H. Macy, Kirsten Dunst, Andrea Martin, Denis Leary, and Willie Nelson.

The sad thing is that I suppose all this is possible, despite some obvious holes in the David Mamet-Hilary Henkin script. The media can certainly manipulate, and why wouldn't gullible people believe what they are being shown? Maybe it's based on the premise that the American people are fairly dumb, and if you don't agree with that, you probably won't like it.

Nevertheless, ""Wag the Dog"" puts forth a provocative idea and gets you thinking, and it's great to see Hoffman and DeNiro as two clever albeit sleazy people who believe the end justifies the means."

It's an intriguing story rooted in Aramaic mythology but applied to 20th century Philadelphia. ""Hobbes"" (Denzel Washington) is a detective who worked on the case of serial killer ""Edgar Reese"" that saw him captured and executed. Not long after this supposed closure, however, other - very similar - crimes start to occur and he and his partner ""Jonesy"" (John Goodman) are perplexed. He keeps hearing a song - the same song the deceased sang as he died, but the people singing it are different. There is something mysterious afoot that can inhabit a body, move effortlessly and invisibly from one to another - and it seems to have ""Hobbes"" in it's sights. Desperate to shield his family from this evil, he must try to find a way to destroy it before it destroys him. It all takes too long to get going, and Goodman is not particularly well cast, but once we have the gist of the plot then Washington and director Gregory Hoblit turn in quite a well put together story, using the photography well to give us a perspective from our menace whilst effectively conveying the sense of nimble mobility this creature possesses as the resourceful ""Hobbes"" tries to combat it. Donald Sutherland pops up now and again, to no real purpose, indeed much of the supporting cast sort of blend into the wallpaper of this exercise that really plays to the strengths of an on-form Washington delivering a solid and interesting theme. It's too long, but still worth watching."

From the biggest hater of the film to the biggest fan of the girls, everyone might as well admit from the very beginning: this film was primarily (and, in the opinion of many, purely) made to promote the Spice Girls as well as their then-new album. The moment you realize/accept that fact is the moment that this film gets easier to sit through. However, it still is very, very hard to sit through, and the majority of the people I know wouldn't be able to sit through the entirety of this mess of a film, not even to satisfy the most basic human instincts of curiosity by finding out what happens in the end. The film pretty much plays like a 90-minute promotional video, or a compilation of music videos with pointless plot in-between each performance to keep the music from getting to be too much. Newsflash: the people who would willingly watch this would most likely be just as happy with a 90-minute compilation of music videos or live performances; they don't care about the film itself. I'm not saying that every single Spice Girls fan hated, or even disliked the film itself(I'm not even claiming that one single fan didn't enjoy seeing the girls being ""themselves""); what I am saying is that they wouldn't have cared if this feature was a 90-minute long music video, instead of the barely coherent mess that the movie is. But, back to the point I was trying to make; the film is a Spice Girls movie. Not a comedy, or a music movie, but a Spice Girls movie. Made entirely for the fans. This, of course, means that the movie is exclusively enjoyable for the fans... and now that the girl-band is no longer a hot subject, and it's no longer ""in"" to like them, their fan-base has been reduced to a minimum. Therefore, now, only seven years after the film was made(or a few years ago, for that matter; ever since they stopped being popular) the film will only appeal to those who are still fans. As you have probably figured out by everything I've written up to this point, I am not, nor have I ever been a fan of the girls. They are charming, sure, their songs are catchy(admit it, even you've hummed along one or two of their singles when it came on the radio), and they are, undeniably, quite attractive, but that's all there is to it... and that's certainly not enough to carry a feature film, once they're no longer famous. Of course, the director probably didn't think about that, and merely made the film to capitalize on their popularity. Oh well. The film now belongs in the same category as one of those films made about some famous guy/girl/group of people that people no longer care about... probably all inspired by The Beatles(unless someone came before them... I'm not sure if they were the first bands to do feature films). The thing is, The Beatles not only were popular back when they made their films, some 30-40 years ago; they still are popular. The Spice Girls aren't. They were merely the newest of the popular teen-bands... and they didn't last much longer than most others. Now, that's enough for the analyzing, on to the review. The plot is barely coherent and poorly paced, constantly throwing new characters into the story, that appear for a few minutes only to disappear again, as well as introducing subplots that are never used to full advantage. The acting is atrocious. The characters are tired stereotypes. The cinematography is forgettable and unimaginative. The humor is British humor at its worst(I think, at least; I haven't seen enough British comedies to determine if there is a lower level than this). All in all, the film have little to offer(apart from one or two clever references and some good self-parodying in one or two places) to anyone but Spice Girls fans. I recommend this exclusively to Spice Girls fans. It's to painful to sit through for virtually anyone else, even if it's just to laugh at the pure stupidity of it. Everyone but Spice Girls fans: Avoid at all costs. 1/10"

I am not sure if this was some kind of weird Titanic tie in where the studio thought anything with a big boat was a sure fire hit? This is one of the better attempts. Its a non-stop action movie which has some real gore, frights, surprises and humour thrown in. Its simply impossible not to be entertained by this. The story is a basic monster hunting down the crew scenario but its done well enough that you have no idea who is next on the menu and it also holds back on the reveal of whats attacking the crew, till well around the halfway of the movie. There are a couple of well know B movie actors in this and its very much B movie fodder, some of the FX in terms of CGI look dated now but some of the models look fantastic. The movie borrows heavily from a number of major action franchises but it doesn't detract from the fun. There are plenty of entertaining death scenes and some which were quite unique and effective. Not sure how I missed this in the past but its highly recommended for a fun action flick. Just be kind on on CGI it was 1998."
354,"Wedding Singer, The (1998)",13-Feb-1998,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"['Comedy', 'Romance']"," I am not a fan of Adam Sandler. His comedy is usually crude and panders to the lowest common denominator of cinema-goer. So why do I tolerate, nay enjoy his performance in this movie?

I think it's because this was one of his earlier efforts and as such he didn't have as much creative control as he does over the tripe he makes now. The comedy is family friendly but actually genuinely good for the most part, the romance is just about on the scale of believable, and the soundtrack is upbeat and fits the tone.

Part of the success of this movie for me is the fact that it's a 90s movie about the 80s, which we don't see very often. The result is the innocent naivet√© of the 90s mixed with the elaborate, flamboyant extravagance of the preceding decade and it's a winning combination. It culminates in just a general 'feel-good' vibe that thrives in the midst of safe but quality comedy and a cheesy, predictable yet satisfying narrative.

Billy Idol's cameo is a highlight and fairly veteran actors such as Steve Buscemi turn in surprisingly adept comic performances alongside Sandler and Drew Barrymore as the romantic leads. The shame, of course, is that people will form an opinion of this move when they see Sandler's face on the front and it may well turn them away from a corny yet very good comedy worth seeing. 7/10."

Unfortunately, the film goes from being interesting to becoming one big letdown as things are revealed and much discussions abound. The film stars Dustin Hoffman, Samuel Jackson and Sharon Stone...three fine actors who add to this film. However, the film features just about no one else after a certain point in the movie and that is the beginning of the big letdown. The story has a discovery of a ship of some sort down rather far underwater. Well a team of scientist and that sort are sent to investigate. Well they board the ship at some point and discover the sphere of the title and soon after many strange things begin to happen and at times it seems like a horror movie, or a less horror filled movie than ""Event Horizon"" though I am not sure which of the two films was released first. Some good effects here and there as well as some bad ones. Good dialog here and there, but a lot of lame stuff as well. I am guessing the book had a bit more depth than this film, but I would have hated to read the book if it kind of became a bore near the end like this film became."

A young boy and his even younger brother slip off from school to indulge in youthful frivolities, and end up as witnesses to a Mob lawyer's suicide. The legal authorities are able to place the youth at the scene of the death, and they suspect the lawyer may have revealed some evidence about a murder that has gone unsolved. The mobsters in the city suspect this too, and the boy is caught between a rock and a hard place, wondering where to go to get help, and to stay ahead of the criminal elements stalking him and his family.

Enter in the scene of total chaos two folks who are attempting to help the boy with his problem. Susan Sarandon has the role of a lawyer willing to risk her career for Ricky, the youth, and Tommy Lee Jones plays an ambitious federal prosecutor anxious to use Ricky's testimony to further his own career. Susan's character takes Ricky under her legal protective wing, as it were, and the two square off in an effort to make the young client, Ricky, turn evidence over to them. Ricky is determined to protect his family before doing anything to help the authorities.

It's a superb suspense thriller, based on the John Grisham novel of the same name, and both Jones and Sarandon turn in great performances. The movie also benefits from support cast members such as Ossie Davis, Anthony LaPaglia, and as ""The Client"", Brad Renfro. Renfro shows some talent, and one hopes that he hasn't wasted the chance to have a good career. I gave the film a rating of 8/10, and would encourage viewers to keep one eye on the screen at all times."

My favorite was Ghost Rider, but after watching Spawn, I couldn't decide over who was better overall. Spawn is an anti-hero comic book character created from the mind of Todd McFarlane. As for the movie, I was hoping for it to be a little more than just satisfactory. And the only thing I can really say that doesn't negatively criticize it, are its visuals.

Spawn is the story of an ex-assassin, Al Simmons, who was left for dead after his evil boss, Jason Wynn, burned him in an explosion. Its not until he is brought to hell and made a deal with Malebolgia to become the leader of Hell's army. Simmons is portrayed by Michael Jai White, and Wynn by Martin Sheen. White was a good choice for Spawn but there were some times where he sounded like he was growling more than talking and it just became tiresome after a while. Sheen was an interesting choice as the villain because of his acting style. Sheen is very smooth and it never seems like he's out of step with his character.

One character that is less tolerable than the others, is The Violator, played by John Leguizamo. It's understandable that Leguizamo was only acting out the personality of The Violator, but it felt like every time he was on screen, it was just another drawback. Almost like Leguizamo's character was supposed to be stealing the spotlight. Not to mention that The Violator wasn't even that funny to begin with; just a nuisance. The action was good in this film. Of course, that's when Spawn was busy trying to get vengeance, which wasn't all too often. Half the time, Simmons was trying to get in touch with his past, which wasn't ever successful.

The other issue was that Spawn didn't learn know how to really control his powers until the very end of the film. And as all origin comic book adaptations go, the superhero figures out how to control their superpowers quickly, but for Spawn, it takes an awful long time. But despite all these flaws, the visuals and special effects are the greatest things about this movie. The costume of Spawn is spectacular. Bright lime green colored eyes, a black suite of armor and a cloak that can be used as camouflage or to enhance anything he wields makes Spawn an awesome superhero. Another plus is how Spawn can form metal objects from his body. Even his costume has a mind of its own! It's a neat trick.

The sounds are cool listening to as well. Hearing how Spawn morphs his skin can get the skin crawling. Also the Violator in his true form was cool to see in the real world as well. What I couldn't understand was the transition between the real world and hell. Whenever the screen is focused on hell, I felt like a video game simulation and not a movie. Another thing I would've like to see was Spawn being a rated ""R"" film; PG-13 just didn't seem like the right tone for this kind of story. The musical score was produced by Graeme Revell and sadly I didn't feel much from it either. There was music but no emotional connection.

Todd McFarlane's comic book adaptation has ensnaring visuals and some decent action sequences but is weighed down by an unsupported soundtrack and a slow moving script. Viewers may also be turned off by Leguizamo's obnoxious character role."

I've known people who are not big fans of Jim Carey's style of comedy and I can see their point. He's just outrageous and rarely witty. But this movie has a bit of everything: clever dialogues, beautiful locations, and of course Jim Carey at his very best.

I find it much funnier than any of his other works. The Mask had too few of the 'mask' scenes, Pet Detective was just about OK, nothing great. This movie though is better because the story flows freely(unlike P.D) and it has a lot of Jim Carey (unlike The Mask). The scene at the monastery is actually brilliantly shot and to have such OTT comedy at what otherwise seems so mystical a location, I've never seen something like that. And lastly, yes it may seem a bit absurd, it's Ace's love for animals that comes out quite well. To have gone to a seclusion for losing a racoon(he was not paid to find anyways) is both hilarious and heart warming.

The rhino scene alone would've made this one of my favorite comedies, but there's so much more on offer.

365,Powder (1995),01-Jan-1995,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," Knocking off another film on a list recommended by PW, this time it's Victor Salva's Powder. This is the second Salva film to appear in this thread, the first was the co called return to B-Horror Jeepers Creepers. One film is about style, one is about substance. Guess which one is which.

A lot of people hate Salva's film simply because of his criminal record, which is weird because I don't usually hear the same mud flinging when people review a Roman Polanksi film. He hasn't done much work in his career, which pretty much consists of Jeepers Creepers I & II and Powder, then there are a bunch of other films that not a lot of people have seen. To say this is his best isn't really saying much, so I'll just say it's his bravest, as well as those involved.

Sean Patrick Flanery gives a wonderful performance here, you feel his heartache from just his eyes. His dedication to the role is admirable. There are certain actors that when you cast them, you know exactly what your getting, case in point: Jeff Golblum. The guy has the exact same style in everyone one of his movies, yet he still remains likable, at least to me.

The film has some bits that really bring it down, but it also has some really powerful scenes. The ""bald as a baby"" bit where they disrobe him is the most powerful scene in my opinion. Here is a guy who just wants to be normal, who longs for something insignificant to us, but near and dear to him. He is then humiliated for this.

I wasn't too big a fan of the climax ending, when he becomes raw energy or something. It was interesting, but just didn't really sit well with me. The film dipped into science fiction, then it went full throttle at the end there.

On a side note: If he can't grow hair, why does he have eyelashes?"

Michelle Pfeiffer is at her best. She is absolutely fantastic in this movie. The actors in the classroom hold their own against her as well.

Basically, the plot is as follows: White teacher enters a mostly-minority ""alternative"" (read: group of kids that act out) classroom and commands respect. In turn, she changes their lives as they change hers. It's basically the story of Raul, Emilio, and Carrie, and how they cope with life as a result of Ms. Johnson.

The movie has some really good lines (my favorite: ""You asked me how I was gonna save your life. This is it. This moment."") and really good drama. Sure, some of it is hokey-it-only-happens-in-the-movies, but the majority of it is good. I'm a guy, and I shed a few tears.

Does this sound the obvious kind of movie gimmick that everyone uses nowadays? Perhaps, but it's an inspired idea all the same. Jane Austen's characters, and her readers, and the society in which her novels are set, like Jane Austen herself, are HEAVILY conscious of class and social standing. No atmosphere quite so snobbish exists in the modern world. EXCEPT, that is, in the corridors and courtyards of the right kind of high school. And where else in the modern world would you find so many people who seem to spend all their time calling on one another?

I was reminded of how well Heckerling moulded ""Emma"" to fit a modern setting when I saw the idiotic 1998 version of ""Great Expectations"", adapted by someone who somehow failed to notice how important all the stuff about class and snobbishness was. It's clear that Heckerling understood her source. She isn't afraid to make changes - even radical changes, if the modern setting requires as much - and no character exists MERELY because they have an analogue in Austen's novel. (The most crucial thing is that the Emma-equivalent be sufficiently charming; and so she is.) The result is a film which is winning and satisfying, whether or not you know anything about the source material."

Bio Dome is not the absolute worst movie I have ever seen, and by no means deserves to be on the bottom 100 list, but it's pretty darn close. I have braved worse before, such as some of the other Paul Shore movies out there. If you can sit through Jury Duty, you'll have no problem watching this. Not that I would recommend putting yourself through such an unnecessary hell.

Bio Dome was absolutely torturous. It's not meant to be taken seriously, but I'm convinced that you would either have to be retarded, or have recently had a lobotomy to enjoy this movie. Movies that have plots that can be summed up in one sentence usually aren't that great to begin with. Here's the whole synopsis: Two stoners go into a bio dome and then come out some time later. Nothing else worthy of mentioning happens, believe me.

There have to be better forms of entertainment than this. Go outside and run yourself into exhaustion. I admit, embarrassed enough, that I did sit through this entire movie, and probably lost precious IQ points as a result. I am now mentally retarded. Don't take the route I did kids.

A true love would not make you break your vows to your husband and take advantage of you in your own home like that. I didn't buy the ""love"" story at all.

This movie is about LUST. Plain and simple. No love. If she would've gotten out of that truck it would've been for lust, not love. And then what? Would it have been forever?

Turns out I was completely wrong and this was indeed a very funny movie.

Steven Weber stars as the titular Jeffrey - an unemployed actor who vows never to have sex again ""because it is too dangerous"". With temptation around every corner, it is proving to be a very difficult task. And then he meets gorgeous hunk Steve (Michael T. Weiss), who happens to be HIV positive.

The film follows Jeffrey and Steve as they enter into a relationship. Off course they encounter obstacles - especially on an intimate level. There are hilarious moments through their adventures and misadventures, and friends they meet along the way. There's eye candy galore!!

Although essentially a comedy, the film also has a fair share of drama, but it never becomes depressing. The dialogue is really funny, and I loved the satire. The film is very well acted. Patrick Stewart, especially was just fabulous! He stole the show in every scene he was in. This man should be gay! Also look out for Nathan Lane as a priest. He is a comedy legend!

The film has a touching, beautiful ending. 'Jeffrey' definitely is a thought-provoking film, told in a funny, lighthearted manner. I've said this before; gay-themed movies are not generally my genre of choice, as I generally found it too clich√©d and predictable, but 'Jeffrey' was an absolute delight to watch. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie."

I really liked the style, the colours, the energy, the basic concept, the action, the comedy, etc. Much of that still holds up today although it's very flimsy - not much is to be found in deeper meaning or originality.

Ebert is right that the characters don't have much individual personality, but that hardly matters. Their teamwork and positive attitudes shine through. Even though it's cliched, at least it's a good message for kids. They do fun things like skydive and roller blade (something I've recently been learning in my mid-30s), all while being safe and wearing their assigned colours. I don't see why they need issues to be more interesting. Nor do I think they need majorly different roles to play. As it is, we at least get Tommy who is a leader and Kimberly who is more sentimental.

The action is enjoyable, especially with some good music to go with it. It's harmless fun with many ridiculous physics-defying moves - a lot of flying kicks and spinning.

Visually, the movie holds up well. The costumes are cool - all different and shiny, including the goodies and the baddies. The special effects are dated but the designs of the zords and robots are cool, all of them newly introduced in this movie.

The music is surprisingly good and underused if anything. The action songs are decent, fit the choreography and don't disrupt the flow, but the orchestral score is even better.

The plot is very thin and full of holes. Apparently the Rangers can casually teleport to other planets and Ivan Ooze's bird monsters can also fly through space with ease. And I didn't know that comets were fireballs which you could throw enemies at. At least the movie hits the right beats and we don't get buried in melodrama or exposition - the story just keeps moving and focuses on the action, comedy and excitement.

Paul Freeman is clearly having fun as the main villain. He gets many funny lines including one he apparently ad-libbed - that he was disappointed to have missed The Brady Bunch Reunion (he likes being around for disasters). As an adult, his performance is the main highlight although the action and some of the comedy is also sincerely entertaining.

I can see that the movie isn't quite as flawless as it felt when I was 10 years old, but it was good enough to engage me and still generate some laughs and smiles. It embraces its goofy, safe, feel-good action and does it well."
375,Showgirls (1995),01-Jan-1995,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," This film is so bad you must see it.

It was supposed to be a star-making vehicle for Elizabeth Berkley of ""saved by the bell"" which was actually a pretty good show.

I suppose they thought they could cash in by taking a semi-attractive star from a tame kids show and showing her in a lot of nakedness and sexual stupidity. Instead it was just plain embarrassing.

By the end of the movie you end up hating her so much that you're glad the movie trashed her 'career'.

Probably the best scene is her sex scene in the pool. It is so poorly acted and shot it is painful to watch. You can tell they thought they were creating some kind of ground-breaking sexual energy, but it just failed miserably.

A couple years ago they brought out a Showgirls boxed special with a shot glass and poster. I don't know how it sold, but I would love to have been a fly on the wall in the pitch meeting.

I saw this movie once a decade ago, yet I find myself compelled to spend 4 minutes of my life berating it.

Anyway, enjoy."

379,Tales From the Crypt Presents: Demon Knight (1995),01-Jan-1995,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Horror']," I didn't have very high expectations for this movie, which was supposed to be, more or less, a kind of light horror for young adults and teenagers. The film was made as a follow-up to a television series, as well as two older films that I've covered before. Unlike the previous films, which have about five short horror stories, this film sought to develop just one and make a feature film out of that. It didn't work out: despite the technical merits and a good cast and crew, the feeling that remains is that the plot has been stretched to the maximum.

In this film, we follow a single night in a decaying roadside motel where, by chance, seven people are gathered when a mysterious traveler arrives. He is Brayker, and he will try to keep a low profile until another character arrives, threatening him and unleashing a chaos that leaves everyone confined to the house. This figure, whose name we never got to know, is willing to do anything to obtain the Key, an ancient and powerful relic that Brayker carries.

As I said, the film has its merits, and it's a lot better than a lot of the crap out there... but needs a more juicy story that can sustain the length without making us feel that all could be solved in the 45 minutes of a TV episode. Another problem I felt is the religious issue: the film wants to follow a fight between good and evil, God vs. Devil etc. And assumes that Brayker's relic is indirectly linked to Jesus and the Collector is, in fact, a ""high-ranking"" demon. However, the name of Jesus is never mentioned, being treated simply as Carpenter, and this association is somewhat putted aside. Respect? An attempt to avoid shoving religion into the film? Maybe, but I don't think it worked out. Also, a final note to the poor use of the love subplot involving the characters Cordelia, Roach and Wally, which could have helped to offset the weakness of the main plot.

The cast is truly lavish for the kind of film it is: William Sadler was very good and competently secures the main character, but it's Billy Zane who steals all the attention with an excellent performance, full of dark humor. You can see how much he is enjoying doing his job. Jada Pinkett Smith, still far from the big hits, has also done an impeccable job here. The film also has the exquisite additions of CCH Pounder and Thomas Haden Church.

On a technical level, the film bets heavily on creating a gloomy atmosphere, wisely taking advantage of a good setting and a suitably dark cinematography, which seeks to make the best use of the light points and the framing. This works really well, but the main dish, as far as horror is concerned, is the special effects and visuals, quite gore and full of artificial blood and slime. Some scenes are explicit enough to make you forget about popcorn for a while, and the malevolent and hideous creatures that appear around here are pretty good. However, it lacks a good soundtrack that helps to wrap everything up and there are too many scenes that are too long or absolutely unnecessary, but that have passed quietly on the editing table to lengthen the film, which drags on like fresh molasses from a moment on."

Here are the good things about this movie. 1) The ribbon looks pretty impressive. 2) Data swears a bit and sings a little ditty while scanning for life forms. 3) It ends. Nothing else is really worth seeing. Kirk seems to be saying, ""Get me out of this franchise!"" with each passing line, while Captain Picard's constant attempts at pathos are nowhere near as convincing as they proved in the series and the other movies.

Additionally, the naval holodeck scene at the beginning is nowhere near as funny as it was meant to be and the rest of the film is populated with new characters who are either dangerously gutless (the captain of the Enterprise-B) or disturbingly one-dimensional (Soran). Whoopi Goldberg gives an interesting performance, but, even coupled with the list of three that I gave above, it's still not enough to salvage this movie.

This is the only Star Trek movie I dislike, let alone hate."
381,Muriel's Wedding (1994),01-Jan-1994,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"['Comedy', 'Romance']"," I haven't seen many Australian films, but I have always been struck by their proclivity to grotesque characterization. This film was no exception. From her careless and unfeeling father to her deliciously shallow and beautiful, popular friends, Muriel is surrounded by the ugliest of humanity. Even our heroine has elements of the grotesque about her until her eventual awakening late in the film. Muriel's friend Rhonda is the only character who lacks the touches of grotesquely, and it's no mistake that she is the character to whom Muriel learns that she can turn.

Muriel's wedding tells the story of a girl who was brought up to believe in her worthlessness. She wants nothing more than to be married to prove herself a success at life and get away from the life she's known. In the midst of all her bad decisions (and in the light of one of the most moving tragedies I've seen in a comedy or drama in a great while), Muriel comes to realize that she is going about success all wrong.

This film is wonderful and charming, a true comedy, but without the saccharin Halmark ending and obligatory romance so prominent in American movies. This is the story of a real hopeless case, who realizes she's not hopeless and has had everything she needed all along."
382,"Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, The (1994)",01-Jan-1994,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['Comedy', 'Drama']"," Most people use the word ""unique"" in an off-handed and lazy manner, applying the word to anything that is a little bit unusual but not downright original. Well, The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert is truly unique in every sense of the word.

What is more unique, I ask, than two drag performers and a transgender woman journeying through the Australian Outback in a camper van during the mid 90s? I've never seen anything similar. Not even remotely.

Priscilla is a journey into the lives of drag performers at a time when being such was a risky pursuit. It is a dangerous job that could mean serious injury if one is not careful. There was a lot of stigma attached to being a drag queen, let alone a transgendered woman in that era. One had to be careful about where and when they held shows and who they allowed in their viscinity.

This movie's greatest gift is that it shines a light on drag and transgenderism, bringing a humanity to these stigmatized identities at a time when it was sorely needed. There are tons of heartfelt moments here, such as when they are inducted into the tribe of natives and put on a show that lasts through the night. It is such a display of warmth and acceptance that was truly beautiful and moving. Another powerful moment is when they enter a bar and are immediately told to leave, only to change everyone's mind and create a more fun and lively atmosphere than probably existed ever before.

It's not just a film about increasing LGBTQ+ visibility though. It's downright fun and we are witness to all of the crazy antics that go on in such a troupe. Bernadette is a master at disarming ill-intentioned people who wish to bring harm to her and her allies. She is like the matriach of the troupe.

Each character feels fully fleshed out and deeply human. We come to feel deep care for each of their journeys to where they are now through flashbacks to pivotal moments in their lives.

The use of colourful costumes amongst the sparse, desolation of the Australian Outback was a very good choice. The juxtaposition of these elements creates vivid and impactful visuals. Indeed, those barren lands seem like an ideal place to live out one's deepest drag fantasies.

The Australian banter was difficult for me to completely integrate into my own cultural understanding (Canadian) but it doesn't really matter because the underlying message came through quite clearly: that the LGBTQ movement is not just a bunch of clowns to jeer at from the sidelines, but people that are fully human and deserve just as much love and acceptance as anyone else.

It's truly a gem of a movie and surely a required viewing for the LGBTQ community. It can teach us a lot about not only performers, but about ourselves and it can powerfully alter our perceptions in a more inclusive direction."

It's definitely got the lowest gag ratio of the three films but there's still enough here to warrant the return. The shorter run time really helps with the lower gag ratio and the jokes that do land still have that same gleeful stupidity.

Leslie Nielsen's gifts are needed more than ever before. Even if the film around him is faltering he never is as he really carries this. Frank briefly becoming the stay at home wife then going undercover gives him plenty of new material to work with and the reaction shots of Nielsen looking baffled will never get old.

Peter Segal's direction doesn't falter straight away as it opens with the funniest opening of the three and the strongest credits sequence. For better and worse, this one's humour feels broader compared to the others as it adds a lot of references to other films in between the slapstick and visual gags. There's still a lot of memorable stuff here, it just luls occasionally."

Hollywood's realisation that Arnie could work in comedy, as long as he's in on the gag and the audience is in on the gag, was probably obvious to scriptwriters and producer's but surely necessary to keep Arnie's career going on for another couple of decades after his 80's action films.

'True Lies' is a straight up comedy that rips off Arnie, Hollywood actioners, and 'James Bond' with 90's style and James Cameron slick.

Bill Paxton is another member of the Cameron ""company"" of actors, reminiscent of John Ford's stable of faves from the 40's and 50's who gets to play his role as a fake secret agent for laughs.

This set up could easily be from a whacky comedy of the 30's or 40's, or even a silent comedy of the 20's with physical japes and jeopardy mashed together for tickles.

All of this silliness is put forth with aplomb due to the production scale and values of a James Cameron film and Arnie vehicle from the prime of both their careers in the 90's.

I rate at 6.5/10 (which I have rounded up on IMDb to a 7.) because this film is a better version of a Johnny English film and better than some of the James Bond action adventure comedies that it plays off of.

The acting is solid throughout and the action is well paced and performed. Editing and sound design aid the overall effect with good stunt work and military equipment thrown liberally into the mix. Comedy comes from one liners and physical mishaps, and, frankly 'home alone' style, or even Laurel and Hardy style, slapstick routines with a mixed up identities silliness of a 'pink panther' skit."

So if you enjoyed the 1991 ""The Addams Family"" movie then you will certainly also enjoy ""Addams Family Values"".

Personally, while the storyline in ""Addams Family Values"" was good, then it wasn't as great as the previous movie. Lots of great elements to be enjoyed in the 1993 movie from writer Paul Rudnick, for sure, but it just was lacking something that was in the first movie. Now, don't get me wrong here, because I am not saying that ""Addams Family Values"" is a bad movie, not at all. For me it was the atmosphere that was lacking from ""Addams Family Values"", as a good part of the movie took place at a cheery camp. Sure, the contrast of the camp in comparison to Wednesday and Pugsley was intentional, but it just took away some of the dark, gothic feel from the first movie.

It was certainly great to have Anjelica Houston, Raul Julia, Christopher Lloyd and the rest return to reprise their roles from the first movie, that is definitely something that made the movie all the more enjoyable. And ""Addams Family Values"" definitely added a bunch of new faces to the franchise, with the likes of Joan Cusack, Peter MacNicol, Christine Baranski, Sam McMurray and Harriet Sansom Harris in smaller roles throughout the movie.

I did enjoy ""Addams Family Values"", no doubt about it, and it is a wholesome movie for the entire family.

My rating of ""Addams Family Values"" lands on a six out of ten stars."

He is treat well by stable master John Manly (Jim Carter) and his incompetent nephew Joe. He is taken with spirited mare Ginger and befriends the smart pony Merrylegs. After Lady Gordon's death, Beauty and Ginger are sold to the cruel, pompous Lady of Wexmire at Earlshall Park. They are painful-bounded to pull her carriage. Ginger struggles with the pain and bolts. This leaves Beauty damaged. The bad treatment continues until Lord Wexmire sells him to become a rent horse under even worst conditions. He is sold once more to London taxi driver Jerry Barker (David Thewlis). It's tough work but Jerry treats him well. He sees Ginger again but she's little more than skin and bones before her death. Jerry gets sick from a freezing night and can no longer work. Beauty is sold again and forced to spend the last of his energy hauling grain. Beauty has nothing left and is on the auction blocks again but this time, he is rescued by Joe.

The narration is weird. It gives the horse Black Beauty humanity but none of the other animals have their voices. It's feels like an old-time Disney movie gone amok. What does interest me is to treat this story almost like a slave who gets sold over and over again. The ups and downs of the various cruel and humane owners are intriguing. This ends up being a tear-jerker if you're an animal lover although it could annoy the hell out of you."

Basically, the white folks were AFRAID to laugh or laughed nervously at the funny bits --and there are many! -- because they'd be ""laughting at Blacks"", while the Blacks also stayed pretty silent because many couldn't laugh at themselves in front of the whites.

I, on the other hand, being Asian (and thus belonging to neither group), had a great time viewing this satire of rap culture and its egos/trappings/values/pseudo-philosophies. The cast is talented and does at great job becoming the characters portrayed. The songs are too funny to be believed.

This enough, should have been in line for a great film and it would have been if one key factor would have been left out. The main character, Danny, is so incredibly annoying that one gets worn out of his constant blabbering to convince Jack Slater that he's not real, everything around him is a movie, and that in real life, he's Arnold Schwarzenegger. Seriously though, if ANYONE, especially a kid that's a fan of the film, was able to go into their favorite movie of all time, they would be living it up and enjoying it!! But in this film, they had him irritated the whole time because no one would believe him that none of it was real and that it was just some movie.

Some would say that it is 'cowardly' to make the main character more sympathetic. I, however, call the screenwriter bold for having taken such a strong direction away from the author's apparent original intention, and furthermore to pull it off so well.

Not only is the script exceptional, not only is the directing exceptional, but the casting is perfect and the acting is right on the mark in every scene and every respect. This is well-balanced and appealing entertainment. A poignant and moving film which will make any open-minded person examine their own looks-based prejudices. I think the film does Isabelle Holland's story more justice than did the work of her own hands. I also find the character of Justin more fleshed out in the movie, with the performance of Mel Gibson, whose face is only half-seen throughout. He does a better job with half his face than your average actor today could do with a hundred faces."

Starring: Robin Williams, Sally Field, Mara Wilson, and Pierce Brosnan

Directed by Chris Columbus. Written by Leslie Dixon and Randi Mayem Singer. Running time: 125 minutes. Rated PG-13 (for sexual references and some language)

By Blake French:

""Mrs. Doubtfire"" is one of the most invigorating, vivid character studies to be produced on the big screen this decade. Most of the characters are strongly executed with decisive dialogue. They are also beautifully written with tainted personalities and uncompromising wit. Chris Columbus has assembled a stellar dramatic comedy with excellent screen writing, giving audiences one of the most punctually artful films I have ever witnessed.

The opening scene is as brilliantly structured as screen writing otherwise comes. It has a middle-aged man named Daniel, whom we learn about as he quits his job as a vocal performer for a children's cartoon after he realizes his employers are immoral. This sequence provides us with a development of the character's inner personality, strong morals and consciences. The audience also leans that he is a silly, easy going person. We soon find out it is these characteristics that propel the movie into the first plot point.

Daniel's wife, Miranda, wishes to divorce him because he is too goofy and immature. We are propelled quickly into the firm second act after the divorce. Before this point, we have witnessed both actions and dialogue reallocating Daniel's love and compassion for his family, especially his children. The film sets up the for following events using Robin Williams character as the plot advancer.

Daniel lusts for time with his children so much, he confidentially disguises himself as a sixty year old woman then applies for a day-care job for his ex-wife--this would allow him to be around his children more often. Miranda falls for it, and the master of disguise gets his opportunity. The film then takes us through a hilarious and emotional journey into the lives of a typical American divorced family.

The internal problem becomes more complex when Daniel's ex wife shows romantic interest in a new boyfriend, underplayed by Pierce Brosnan. The filmmakers could have done more with the Brosnan character. Here, he seems developed with repetition and dialogue. Although his purpose is to accommodate romantic competition, we don't know enough about him to care that much.

""Mrs. Doubtfire"" contains some material that fairs as overly blunt and outwardly apprehensive. Although the overall presentation is understandable and relative, I still think the picture could have been better with more careful script writing. Even such, we are able to witness a powerful, touching film with a conclusion that is so settling, you will cry with joy.

OK... So this isn't young Frankenstein or Blazing Saddles, but overall, it's a pretty funny Mel Brooks Movie. It is a send up of Robin Hood movies in general, but specifically ""Robin Hood Prince of Thieves"" in the same way that ""Spaceballs"" was a sendup of the Star Wars movies.

We get the usual Brooks schtick here.... Jewish jokes, (Brooks doing a cameo as ""Rabbi Tuchman"", Richard Lewis muttering ""Trafe"" when Robin drops a pig on the table)(""Trafe"" is a yiddish word for something that is non-kosher) , references to (then) current events and movies, (Dave Chappelle in his movie debut, being roughed up by the royal guard, and saying... ""I hope someone is making a video of this"", and the archer aiming at Robin from ""Ye olde folio depository.) There's even a tribute to ""Blazing Saddles"", but I won't give that one away. (One other thing..... Only Mel Brooks could find a way to fit a ""Malcom X"" reference into a Robin Hood Movie.)

There's Brooks standard breaking of the ""4th wall"", (cameramen and crew obviously visible and part of the movie), and Robin announcing.... ""Prepare for the fight scene."" AND, there's even a big slap in the puss to Kevin Costner when Elwes says.... ""Unlike other Robin Hoods, *I* can speak with an English accent."" (Trivia note: Out of all the actors who have played Robin Hood, Elwes is the only British actor to do so.)

The musical numbers are fun, (We're men, (MANLY MEN!), we're men in tights....... We roam around theforest looking for fights.......) and even though the movie is a bit dated now, (it came out in 1993), it still has enough humor to hold one's interest. Sure, some of the jokes are going to be clinkers, (lend me your ears!!!) but overall, the movie holds up well. The movie recently came out in DVD as a Mel Brooks box set. One can only hope that it will come out as a single DVD soon, hopefully with some great extras. It's not a Brooks classic, but it's one that I really enjoy."

Waters has been dubbed 'The Pope of Trash' by various news outlets and magazines throughout his career, a title that he seems to cherish. From what I've heard, some of his other films feature absolutely disgusting imagery, but somehow his earlier, more crass films still received moderately good reviews. I was intrigued enough to check out his work, but not so intrigued that I wanted to jump right into ""Pink Flamingos"", so I settled on this movie, one that Waters had called his favorite of his own films on a number of occasions. Unsure of what I'd experience, and, I admit, a touch nervous, I sat down and started my first John Waters film, only to begin laughing almost immediately. If I'm being honest, I really enjoyed this film, far more than I'd imagined I would. In fact, I've already started narrowing down the next Waters' film I want to tackle (not ""Pink Flamingos""- I don't know if I'll ever be ready for that). This film, while certainly not for everyone, is a hilarious satirical look at what the tiny things can do to drive one mad."

Basically everyone from the '70's , 80's and 90's generation grew up with playing Nintendo games and the Super Mario games in particular. However when one sees this movie, it becomes pretty obvious early on that this movie has almost nothing to do with the Super Mario video games. The atmosphere, settings and characters are totally different, which is probably the main and also only reason why this movie was and still is hated among so many all over the world.

However, when one has to look at this movie with a fair and unbiased view, one has to come to the conclusion that this movie is good decent entertainment. No, it's not a GREAT movie but it does serve its purpose and that is to provide the viewer with 104 minutes of mindless, simple entertainment.

Kids will most likely like this movie best. The story is wonderfully adventurous and it all is very childishly simple constructed. I mean, the story and setting all basically have very little to do with the games but when you just have to judge the story, it's a pretty good and well thought out one. If the main characters were, let's say, some average Manhattan plumbers named the William's brothers and the entire movie wasn't based on a series of video games, than perhaps the movie would had received a far better reception and would had entertained and reached a wider audience.

All of the characters are pretty entertaining and work out well in the movie. This is probably mainly due to the well known cast. Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo are the Mario brothers and they form a pretty good main duo. Dennis Hopper also is in his element as the ruthless, over-the-top, stereotyped villain King Koopa. He gives the movie a certain extra fun and flair. Other well known actors in the movie are Fiona Shaw, Gianni Russo (Carlo Rizzi from the first two The Godfather movies) and Lance Henriksen in a very small cameo role.

Unlike the games, the movie is a dark one. All of the sets are dark which was perhaps not the greatest atmospheric mood for the story and the entire movie in general. All of the sets are disappointing, small and unimaginative looking. Same goes for the costumes and most of the make-up effects. The movie however has some good and convincing looking early special effects. Remember folks, that it was 1993 when this movie was released.

The movie however is most of the time a bit too childishly told and the dialogs are below par and too simple.

The pace and editing is good but the movie severely lacks some action and real interesting moments. At moments it takes too long before something good or interesting happens again, which makes this movie perhaps a bit boring and uninteresting to watch at certain points.

All in all it's a not very successful- but still yet entertaining first attempt at making a movie based on a video game. Certainly better than some of those movies based on video games, released this present day!

The two headed up a cast that really satirized the famous sugary sitcom that Paramount television brought us from 1969 to 1974, The Brady Bunch.

Time has stood still for the family in The Brady Bunch Movie. Gary Cole and Shelley Long have raised their blended family right from the Seventies. The parents and kids listen to the music, dress in the fashion and behave otherwise as if the Eighties and Nineties just never took place. The kids stand out quite a bit from their peers in their suburban school.

The main plot such as it is has the Bradys being under siege by their neighbors, the Dittmyers, Michael McKean and Jean Smart who need the Brady home in order to complete a big real estate deal. They'll get it by fair means or foul. The Dittmyers are best described as poor relations of that other TV family, the Bundys.

A big part of the problem with this film is that you would have to have been a fan of the show and presumably have seen it in reruns a gazillion times on the TVLand channel in order to appreciate it. About 15 of the various episodes are used in creating the plot. That's a component that someone who never saw the show couldn't possibly get.

Still some of the sly innuendo also comes from the Nineties culture with RuPaul as the school guidance counselor eying Christopher Daniel Barnes as Greg and a young lesbian girl carrying a big old torch for Marcia played by Christine Taylor. Jennifer Elise Cox has taken over nicely the role of the ever dissatisfied middle sister Jan who the real and original Carol Brady as the grandmother finally deals with in the appropriate manner.

As in any of the television Brady episodes goodness and vacuity ultimately triumph and to find out how and which episode plot lines are used to bring that about, you'll have to sit back and enjoy the big screen version of America's most famous blended family."

But in fact, the screenplay should have propelled the Academy to create a separate category alongside Best Original Screenplay and Best Adapted Screenplay. Yes, Smart Ass Screenplay of the year or Most Commercial Screenplay. Jerry Zucker does a masterful job allowing Rubin's stroke of genius to unfold without major interference. Demi Moore is scrumptious and what Maurice Jarre does with her tears deserves an award of its own. Patrick Swayze suffers with a certain amount of dignity, his anger is very virile but his expressions of longing are pure Lana Turner. What makes the whole calculated enterprise worth every bit of its hype is Whoopi Goldberg. She brings the tale where it really belongs. A comedy. A ghostly comedy about enduring love."

These artists were the core of Disney's animation studio for many years, turning out what are now revered as the classics from Disney.

What sets Pinocchio apart from every other Disney feature is the sheer depth of care those nine old men (and their assistants) put on the screen. No other Disney feature looks this tremendous, only Snow White comes close. Every, and I mean every, background painting is superb. The medium used for the backgrounds was a water-based paint called gouache. No other animated film looks like this. To think that the entire film was done by hand is amazing, the spectacle of Pleasure Island and the last underwater segment are brilliant compositions by illustrative geniuses. As the darkest fable Disney would bring to the screen, each of the nine old men brought their A game to their characters. Bill Tytla, the studio's ""villain master"" (he was responsible for the unforgettable Chernobog in Fantasia's ""Night on Bald Mountain"" sequence) brings Stromboli to energetic life here. Watch carefully for the table sequence in which Stromboli is eating. He has swallowed part of an onion before berating Pinocchio and shaking the puppet. His breath brings tears to Pinocchio's eyes...this goes by very quickly, but shows the attention to detail crafted in every frame of this terrific film.

Many reviews here seem to dwell on the voice acting and the use of ""nobodies"" to speak the lines. One review casually suggests that the actors were simply picked off the street. Nothing could be further from the truth. Even though the actors are uncredited here, the roster of talent was very top-notch for 1940. Comedian Walter Catlett voices the Fox, Catlett was extremely popular at the time and known for his signature round spectacles. The Fox wears these same specs for a brief moment, a nod given to Catlett by the artists. Frankie Darrow was a well known juvenile actor, most famous for his leading role in 1933's ""Wild Boys of the Road"". He voices Lampwick, which is a thinly veiled caricature of the real actor. Dickie Jones, the voice of Pinocchio was another child star who kept a remarkable career alive for many decades. Mel Blanc, the ""man of 1000 voices"" lends his talent to the hiccups of Giddy the Cat, Evelyn Venable is the warm and lovely voice of the Blue Fairy, Clarence Nash, the voice of Donald Duck for years, supplies both Figaro and the donkey brays by the doomed boys of Pleasure Island. Last but not least is Cliff ""Ukelele Ike"" Edwards, the voice of Jiminy Cricket. Edwards will always be known as the man who sang ""When You Wish Upon a Star"" so brilliantly. He owns that song as surely as Judy Garland owns ""Over the Rainbow"". No real voice talent in Pinocchio? Not true. These actors were as famous in their day as the current crop of voices used for animated features. Their work brings the heart to the skill of the animator's art.

Still a thrilling experience for fans of the nine old men. In this day of computer technology, it's worth remembering that a computer can't bring the same humanity and love delivered by these great artists."
405,Mission: Impossible (1996),22-May-1996,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Mystery']"," When I first saw this movie in the movie theaters in 1996, I remember it received mixed reviews from critics, as well as the general audience. It wasn't universally well received. Although, director Brian De Palma, star Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt and a handful of cool action scenes, kept this film a strong effort, it unfortunately, contained a script, that was too tortuous and bogged down the pacing of the film. It was somewhat dull. The big payoff at the end of the film contained a ridiculous finale in the shape of a helicopter in a tunnel. When I left the theater that day I wrote this.

""Let me see if I got this right. Tom Cruise's secret agent character, Ethan Hunt, makes his theatrical film debut. His IMF team is ambushed in Europe and his boss accuses him of being a spy. Hunt than has to figure out, who ambushed his team, killed his boss, Jim Phelps (John Voight) and figure out, who tagged him as an enemy agent. He also needs to steal a list of spy codes, for a woman with no name, maybe Max and keep himself from getting killed. As the plot thickens, dead people start to pop up all over the place, as he fights to clear his name. There is plenty of suspense in this film. There are some great moments of De Palma directorial magic, especially with the excellent cinematography. He also did some clever things with the use of audio (or absence of sound). The special effects are very good and every action scene is a thrill ride.

The acting of Cruise and the rest of the cast is done well. The plot of Mission Impossible (1996), is what is wrong with this film. There is too much second-guessing seen from the characters and it is especially taxing on the audience. The plot was confusing, with too many questions at the end. The plot has a pace, that moves like hills and valleys, between action and non-action. I had fun watching Mission Impossible (1996), but when the film took me to the edge of my seat, it then dropped me like a ton of bricks and I sat there looking for more. This is not the best of Brian DePalma's film work. He has an incredible resume of films actually. He is one of my favorite film directors. His best film being, the Untouchables (1987), blows this film out of the water. I understand De Palma may have had some conflicts with Tom Cruise and maybe that threw his pacing off. I'm not sure. However, the film is still fun to watch, and if you figure out, what the heck is going on, you will have fun with it too"".

I still feel the same about this movie, here in the 21st century. It is a good movie, but not a great movie. It launched a film franchise, which I think improved with age. If I remember correctly, the reviews were mixed for MI #2 and #3. It wasn't until the fourth film, Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol (2011), was released, that the franchise started to take off. Anyway, De Palma fans can enjoy this entry on his film list, Cruise fans can see how his character has evolved (Cruise himself was only 34 when he did this film), since he first did this film, almost 30 years ago. I also still think it was interesting, that Emilio Estevez and the other spy characters, seen in the beginning of the film, all had uncredited roles in this film. I always wondered if that was a gimmick, used to help emphasize the covert guise of Hunt's spy team.

It's not a masterpiece. It's a simple story, simple characters... but why would you expect anything else? Just look at the DVD cover for f***'s sake. I'm baffled by the people who come on this movie's forum and are surprised by what a bad movie it was. Uh yeah, don't get me wrong, it's a RIDICULOUSLY stupid movie, but that's pretty much what I was looking for when I rented it.

Had I gone into this movie without any former expectations, I would have given it 5 stars overall. The acting was way over the top, the directing not so great, and the writing wasn't spectacular either. However, the story was moderately clever, and it gets points for keeping a fairly tongue-in-cheek humor about it; at no point did I feel like it was trying to take itself seriously. I give it another star based entirely off the strength of it's makeup effects (yes, they're that good, considering it was made in a time before digital makeup).

Finally, I give it 7 stars, simply because it met my expectations as a cheesy, over-the-top, horror romp, and I would've expected nothing less from ""Stephen King's Thinner""."

It's shining light without doubt is Robin Williams. I can't imagine anyone else playing the role really. He manages to capture the childish side of Jack perfectly,while also portraying the inner struggle well too. Sadly the film never seems to know what it wants to be (Comedy? Drama?)and a fine performance gets lost in the middle.

My big flaw with the film apart from the tone is the length. It does go on a bit. There's a whole 20 minute section in which nothing really happens to drive the plot.

But then, just as you're about to give up on it, the ending is great. Funny, moving, not overly sentimental,it's a lovely moment.

With sharper editing and a sense of focus 'Jack' could be up there with Robin Williams' best work but sadly it never quite lives up to potential."

The hardest part of blending families is when two kids have the same name.

Fortunately, none of the step-siblings in this comedy share a moniker.

When Carol's (Shelley Long) long thought dead first husband (Tim Matheson) turns out to be very much alive, her marriage to Mike Brady (Gary Cole) and the home they've built with their six children, Greg (Christopher Daniel Barnes), Marcia (Christine Taylor), Jan (Jennifer Elise Cox), Bobby (Jesse Lee Soffer) Cindy (Olivia Hack), and housekeeper (Henriette Mantel) is jeopardized.

But their bond is tightened when their mom is kidnapped and the gang must head to Hawaii to rescue her.

One of the few sequels - especially a comedy - to equal its original, this lampoon of the beloved 1970s sit-com plays on familiar themes from the show but with tongue-in-cheek and incestual innuendo.

Besides, you're not genetically related, so why can't you French kiss your step-pet?

Set in 1954, Baker plays a young NBC writer for a live TV show starring a Sid Caesar type (Bologna). He is put in charge of a drunken film swashbuckler named Alan Swann (O'Toole) to keep him sober and make sure he shows up for the rehearsals and the performance. This includes bringing Swann (totally based on Errol Flynn) to his family's home in Brooklyn for dinner, riding on a stolen policeman's horse through Central Park, and witnessing Swann going over a rooftop with a fireman's hose tied around him. That's actually the good news. All goes well until Swann realizes it's going to be a live show. ""I played before an audience once!"" he screams. ""I was a butler. I had one line. I forgot it."" One of my favorite lines was made all the more hysterical by O'Toole throwing it away - when he's questioned about going to the Stork Club, he says, ""Why not? It's been a year. Surely they've fixed the wall and replaced the bandstand."" The film captures the egomania of the TV star with Bologna's fabulous portrayal of King Kaiser, who is being threatened by a mobster (Cameron Mitchell) due to his weekly impersonation of the man; their scene together is a riot. Mark Linn-Baker is delightful. The other actors fit their roles to a T. As far as O'Toole, what can be said? As Alan Swann, he is sheer perfection - dissipated but handsome, drunken but charming, frustrating but lovable - a man who hides his sorrows, fear and loneliness in drink and debauchery. A truly great portrayal that doesn't simply rely on the surface comedy but lets you see the man beneath.

Director Richard Benjamin gives us the feel of '50s New York and live TV in all of its excitement and keeps the pace going beautifully. A real treasure you won't mind seeing more than once."

Simple, episodic frontier tale given the Walt Disney touch: lots of cute, heart-tugging sentiment, plus a prescient 'circle of life' message at the end. Tommy Kirk gives arguably his best juvenile performance here, and mom Dorothy McGuire beams commendably without lapsing into syrupy goodness. The gorgeous color photography, the warm family narrative, and a jaunty title song all conspired to make the picture a box-office winner, but the main reason it's called a Disney Classic today is because of that dog.

But, there is a catch here, in order to pull off the identical twins separated at birth premise, a logical reason behind their parents' seemingly cruel decision of keeping a lid on the truth as if they never give a toss about another half of the twins, must be propounded, only the result is not quite satisfactory, temperamental incongruity is a way-too-facile occasion of their failed marriage, especially both parents lead a well-to-do and respectable life, respectively, severing their consanguineous tie is not something of their ilk's disposition.

Anyway, enough of this reviewer's caviling about the set-up, 14-year-old twins Sharon McKendrick and Susan Evers (Mills, with the help of Susan Henning as her body double), meet for the first time in the summer camp, after latching onto the fact (in a cabin named Serendipity!), they decide to switch places, Sharon visits California to stay with her father Mitch Evers (Keith), while Susan is hot to trot to meet her mother Maggie McKendrick (O'Hara) in Boston, by impersonating each other.

Their tricks work wonderfully to warm the cockle of one's heart, belated union larded with heartfelt embraces and affections, only Mitch's housekeeper Verbena (Merkel, having a ball with her hilarious tight-lipped loquaciousness, but not without astuteness) senses something iffy when Susan's dog refuses to approach Sharon. But time is running out for the twins who are spoiling for getting their parents back together, as Mitch is bewitched by a sultry gold digger Vicky Robinson (Barnes), and soon they will tie the knot. The hurdle is inevitably, stemmed from a man's inanity, it doesn't need a keen eye to discern the motive of Vicky and her mother (Watkins, sporting a perfect hag voice), and truth to be told, a magnificent Maureen O'Hara is simply out of the league of a bungling David Keith (although he has a terrific comic bent to make Mitch somewhat more than tolerable, bar an incredulous pratfall that is too slapdash for Disney's standard).

After Susan letting on the whole switch scheme, she and Maggie blow in at Mitch's domicile, and the girls will do anything to sabotage their father's pending wedding, but it is Maggie's guile that does the trick, and the rest is par for the course. But as soon as the girls' appearances are unified (by way of a simple haircut in the camp), their disparate personalities built ebulliently in the first half-hour (Mills proffers a convincing yet very subtle dual personae indeed) also harmonize into a sameness, for shizzle their parents cannot tell them apart, so does the audience, quite a misstep to erase their individuality and the zippy city-versus-ranch upbringing clash at that stage, plus, encouraging playing elaborate-looking pranks might partially and insidiously incubate the heinous bully culture which would have been rampant for decades and then some.

In a nutshell, from Richard and Robert Sherman's chirpy titular song accompanied by its dainty opening credits and title cards scenes (two chubby Cupids sharing a kiss steals my heart), to its seamless construction of two Mills in the same frame, THE PARENT TRAP proves to be a delightful confection when Disney is very much in its winsome wheelhouse."

If you add the crazy king father, the ugly bad characters (why this link?), the sadistic cat and helpful dog (why this discrimination), the abusive stepmother and stupid henchman, you find finally a universe in which I don't feel happy, in which family love is nonexistent and that's a bit hard!

At last, we have those chipmunks-like mice that bring fun and lightness! For me, they are essential to this movie because without them, it would have been simply unwatchable. It's not the speedy, delirious, crazy and funny Sylvester & Tweety but some moments makes me laugh!

The other thing i notice is that for that date, this animation was showing the future of the live movies: Colored, powerful visuals and horizon lines, stunning effects, only those things was first delivered then by Disney and it would take 10 years before the gap would be shorten by true movies!

Of course they had: it's just that someone had got it wrong; and as it turned out, it was me. I still think that anyone who calls `Mary Poppins' Disney's finest is being silly - Disney's finest hour was clearly the one that saw `Pinocchio', `Fantasia', `Dumbo' and `Bambi' - but what we have here is a fine, clever film, NOT overly sweet.

What won me over was the ending. David Tomlinson changes from a mechanical banker to a human being with surprising fluency. It's not any one scene: it's the entire extended sequence, from the run on the bank to the end credits. And it's not just Tomlinson's acting, either, but the long, lingering shots of him standing and walking in darkness, and a use of music that's far more sophisticated than I'd first supposed it to be, the general intelligence of the script. The last lines given to Mary Poppins I'd missed the point of the first time round. She's a riddle throughout the film which the film's conclusion partially, but only partially, unravels.

Considered as a musical `Mary Poppins' lacks something. WHAT it lacks is revealed when we hear the Jane and Michael tramping around the house singing `Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious' (a great song, by the way) - and they GET THE TUNE WRONG. They get it wrong in exactly the irritating way that children WOULD get it wrong. This may be an inspired touch of realism, but it surely violates the ethos of musicals, as do the deeply pedestrian songs `Stay Awake', `Sister Suffragette' and `A Spoonful of Sugar'. This was the side of `Mary Poppins' I'd remembered. I'd forgotten the haunting quality of `Feed the Birds' and `Let's Go Fly a Kite', and the punch of the score as a whole.

So anyway, I'm now a convert. I can't find anything to seriously object to except Dick Van Dyke's ludicrous accent, which makes him sound almost, but not quite, like Bugs Bunny."
420,Alice in Wonderland (1951),01-Jan-1951,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['Animation', ""Children's"", 'Musical']"," Saying that all old Disney movies are classics is like saying that all cars are classics just because they are old... anyway, whether it's a classic or not, this Disney movie deserves our attention: it entertains quite well and gives children an innocent and funny story.

I will not dwell on the analysis of the story: anyone who knows the work of Lewis Carroll (the film focuses on ""Alice in Wonderland"" but will get some elements from ""Through the Looking Glass"") will surely identify the story and its characters, some of them as immortal as the Mad Hatter, the March Hare or the Cheshire Cat. They are iconic and recognizable even by those who have never read Carroll's books and stories.

The film is beautifully animated, with vivid and elegant colors, and a limpid, crisp and very well executed look, for which contributed the skillful hands of hundreds of designers from Walt Disney's studio. The film was made at a time when the studio did its best graphic work and the quality is visible. The songs are another important part of the movie, and there are several important and noteworthy songs here. Personally, I really like listening to ""A World of My Own"" or the march ""Painting the Roses Red"". The film counts with the impeccable collaboration of many voice actors, of which I want to highlight Kathryn Beaumont, Ed Wynn, Sterling Holloway and Verna Felton.

Despite everything, I think the film was pretty much forgotten for a long time, and it didn't have the success that it could have had: in fact, the crazy and illogical story that it presents can both attract or repel the audience... it's not a story for everyone to enjoy, as palatable and cute as ""Cinderella"" or ""Peter Pan"", films that are much easier to sell. Paradoxically, the recent appearance of live action films centered on Alice's tale may, in a way, have revived the interest of more recent audiences in Carroll's work and, consequently, in this animated film."

It was something that I could laugh at rather than take seriously. I tried after a few minutes more but it's hard to take Leonardo DiCaprio who I believe is a very talented actor and Clare Dane who is just as talented playing in modern times. We know nobody talks like that. If they had adapted Romeo and Juliet to more modern language, I think I would have bared the film in general. But the language and the modern day scenery do not mix well for me. I'm old fashioned I guess in general. I know the director wanted something different for Romeo and Juliet. Few films can beat the 1968 version with Olivia Hussey and this film would not be very welcome if I was teaching Romeo and Juliet. It's too far fetched and ridiculous. I know it's modernized for the audience. But I like my Shakespeare to be precise and old fashioned. I love Miriam Margolyes as the nurse and Christina Pickles as one of the mothers but it just doesn't feel right. Mercutio's supposed to be a drag queen which I felt was really something that made my stomach turn in general was out of this world. It's not for me and I accept that. If there are others happy with it, so be it but not for me."

After a gentle alien becomes stranded on Earth, the being is discovered and befriended by a young boy named Elliott (Henry Thomas). Bringing the extraterrestrial into his suburban California house, Elliott introduces E.T., as the alien is dubbed, to his brother and his little sister, Gertie (Drew Barrymore), and the children decide to keep its existence a secret. Soon, however, E.T. falls ill, resulting in government intervention and a dire situation for both Elliott and the alien. E.T. is still consider one of the greatest movies ever made, and it's not hard to understand why. I just recently watched this again with my 7-yeard-old and we both had a very good time. This is a very good movie that the whole family can enjoy. The overall acting was pretty good for it being a movie from the early 80's. I mean let's face it the stories were better and original back then, but the acting has come a long way. However, Spielberg pulled out a brilliant child performance from Henry Thomas. He did an amazing job as the main lead Elliot. You can watch his audition tape on YouTube and it's not hard to see why he got the job. With Spielberg behind the camera, there was no way that people did not see that this was a success waiting to happen. The man does Science Fiction the way no other director can or at least has accomplished. He had three major success stories prior to E.T (Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Raiders of the Lost Ark) so having yet another brilliant success right afterwards basically cemented his name in Hollywood. The way he shoots this movie is breathtaking with a lot of wide angled takes. Overall, this movie is just brilliant. I know there are some people that don't believe it aged well and think E.T is just creepy and don't really by into the story. But I do. I buy every single bit of it. I highly recommend this movie to anybody who loves to sit down and watch a beautiful story about friendship, and how far some will go to help an individual in need. 5/5"

This excellent mockumentary passed me by when it came out, so I was glad to discover it now.

Strong performances by the whole cast really make this movie shine, Gore Vidal is especially convincing as the incumbent senator, as is Robbins himself and the eerie puppet master Alan Rickman. The message of style over substance in politics making the news in America holds even more true today.

It's really too bad that this movie was mismarketed and essentially buried, it seems that even now it hasn't gotten the audience it deserved. The politicized nature of the content is most certainly the cause of that you can be sure.

The songs are frighteningly well put together and convicing, apparantly Robbins never released a soundtrack for fear of having them taken out of context. Anybody even remotely interested in the Mockumentary genre, or in politics should definitely check this gem out. A brilliant piece of black comedy."

But now, since I'm already a teen, I could say that I'm no longer a hardcore Transformers fan. Enough of that little history, I would now comment about the movie. The visual is excellent, better than the TV series due to some neat visual effects. The soundtrack is awesome, it is more on heavy metal, so it's sounds modern and it fits the movie so well because most of the setting are almost industrial-like, not just that, but robots are made of metal y'know! Some of the characters are new, and they're all interesting, the voice quality is excellent. The story itself, however, can be both good and bad. The good part is that, for the first time in the series, the story is dark and very mature, unlike the TV series. The bad part is that most of your favorite transformers will face such untimely fate. This movie does makes me cry for some part which I will not tell. While some makes me happy, as you can see the theme of the series is the same, no matter how powerful evil can be, there is hope to overcome it. I recommend it if you're a Transformers fan or if you're interested in watching it."
427,To Kill a Mockingbird (1962),01-Jan-1962,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," Generally, I prefer to review movies I dislike, because I am better able to quantify negative opinions than positive ones, but ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" deserves a review as few other movies I have ever seen. I probably cannot make any statement about this film that has not already been made many times, but it really is one of the most beautiful and moving films I have ever seen.

I first read Harper Lee's lovely novel when I was a young teen, and it was one of those books that gave me an experience that changed the way I perceived the world and my own family. The movie stays true to the wonderful, innocent prose.

Every time I watch, I see my father in Atticus Finch. He, too, is a southerner who respects people and defends his beliefs. He also has always respected his children and treated us the way Atticus treats Scout and Jem. I also see other family and friends in various characters in the film, because we have such strong southern roots. Even the negative aspects of racial antipathy and loss of childish innocence bring certain memories to mind.

Those who did not grow up in the south or with southern families might not see parallels the way I do, but the movie would be a gem to anyone. Gregory Peck put in the performance of his career, and the children acted in the least forced manner I have ever seen. The cinematography is also beautiful, and the script is perfectly balanced-not too sparse, but also not dialogue heavy.

The best thing about ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is that it preserves the spirit of the novel that resounds with so many people. This film stands as one of the best ever arguments for tolerance, loving families, and the beauty of life through a child's eyes. Everyone who watches movies ought to see it."
428,Harold and Maude (1971),01-Jan-1971,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Comedy']," ""Harold and Maude"" is a delightful, funny, moving, off-beat black comedy with a lot of heart. It is also one of the best and unusual on-screen romances I've seen. If the opposites attract each other, there have not been perhaps more different in every possible way screen couple than 20 years old Harold (Bud Cort) and Maude(charming, clever, multi-talented Ruth Gordon, the Oscar winning actress and three times Oscar nominee for writing) who is just about to turn 80. Harold is a rich kid who is obsessed with death and likes to stage very believable and hilarious succession of suicide attempts to impress his unflappable socialite mother who got used to them and not impressed anymore. Harold's others hobbies are driving the hearse and to attend funerals where he meets one day a woman who will change his life forever, 79 years young free-spirit, rebel, and fighter for ""Liberty. Rights. Justice"", Maude. She also likes to attend the funerals of the strangers. We won't learn much about Maude's life story but there will be one visual flash which gives us a very good idea that Maude knew a lot about death, losses, and suffering but she chose to celebrate, worship, and enjoy life to the fullest. This short poignant moment is a stroke of genius, and there are many of them in the truly unique, one of its kind movie. Maybe Hal Ashby had brought some of memories from his own childhood that included the divorce of his parents, his father's suicide, his dropping out of high school, getting married and divorced all before he was 19, into ""Harold and Maude"". Hal Ashby had made a series of memorable, intelligent, well acted films in the 70s, that included The Last Detail (1973), Shampoo (1975), Bound for Glory (1976), Coming Home (1978) and Being There (1979) but it is ""Harold and Maude"" that has become the cult classic from the first days of its release and it more than deserves its status. The movie also benefits tremendously from the soundtrack of songs by Cat Stevens."

I'm not nearly as old as this film and the first time I saw it, I was a young child and impressionable as only young children are. I can honestly say that every alien encounter I've experienced through movies, t.v. shows and literature has been measured against The Day The Earth Stood Still, and most have come up short. I credit the film's depiction of human/alien interactions with my present-day feelings about how people should treat each other - within communities and groups and how we often fail in our dealings with outsiders. I think the movie made the young girl I was think about issues that would otherwise have gone unexamined for many years to come, and in those years I would have become a different person. The effect was deeply profound, and remains so even 30 years after my first screening. That said, it is still entertaining, a joy to revisit. There are no expensive, hi-tech special effects that look great in teasers, but do nothing for the plot. It's very straight forward, honest, pure. It's emotional and intellectual instead of the typical shoot-em-up space battle films that are today's norm. And while I enjoy a good explosion now and then, the change of pace is refreshing."
430,Duck Soup (1933),01-Jan-1933,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"['Comedy', 'War']"," One of the funniest films ever made, Duck Soup is total insanity and a fast pace by the Marx Brothers. Is this merely a string of gags or is this pungent political satire? Does it matter? Priceless gags include the famous ""mirror"" act, the lemonade stand, and some of the funniest plays on words ever heard. Groucho play Rufus T. Firely, who comes to the aide of struggling Freedonia, seemingly run by a wealthy society dame, Mrs. Teasdale (Margaret Dumont). Chico and Harpo play spies in the employ of the rule of Sylvania (Louis Calhern). Nothing makes sense but then this IS about politics. Fast pace zips this film along (directed by the great Leo McCarey) so that the gags and jokes are dizzying. The three brothers are all wonderful as is Dumont. Also thrown into the mix is the exotic Raquel Torres, funnyman Edgar Kennedy, and the lackluster Zeppo Marx. Best gags include the mirror act with Grouch and Harpo (redone on one of Lucille Ball's TV series with Harpo 20 years later); the lemonade sequence with Chico, Harpo, and Kennedy, and of course the bizarre war finale with the brothers and Dumont, who was one of the best comedy foils in film history.

The usual Marx Brothers blend of skimpy plot, musical numbers and non-stop gags makes this the best of their films. Film history tells us Duck Soup was originally a flop, that it was the last of their films for Paramount, and the final film appearance for Zeppo (no loss there). The Marx Brothers were saved by Irving Thalberg at MGM, and the 3 brothers went on to a few big successes at that studio. One of the funniest films ever made."
431,Highlander (1986),01-Jan-1986,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['Action', 'Adventure']"," When he is fatally wounded in a battle but yet survives with no visible marks, Connor MacLeod is expelled from his village. When he is visited by Rameriz he learns that he is immortal and together they train for the eventual day when the immortals will battle to find the only one. Centuries later, beheadings are the top crime of the day in New York as the final gathering approaches with the evil Kurgan looking to destroy all before him. Meanwhile journalist Brenda Wyatt begins looking into the story around an ancient sword that was used in one of the beheadings.

Beginning a series that really should have stuck with it's own catchphrase and only made one, this film is easily the best of the lot. The plot sees the film jumping around between times without too much in the way of structure - some scenes allowing comedy, others drama. It doesn't all totally work but it is still quite a fun film to watch anyway. While the plot fails to really engage, the film moves fast enough to be enjoyable - with the first half having the better structure as a learning experience for Connor and, hence, for the audience. It is fun if a little silly. It is the skips forward in time that are the problem.

They demand a little more structure and a greater degree of character development - neither of which really are forthcoming. In fairness it still manages to look good and be entertaining nonetheless. The sword fights are pretty basic but still stylishly directed and have a slick music video feel to them. It's the romantic interest that is the biggest difference between the times: in Scotland the aging of Connor's wife is emotional, in New York the love interest is just an excuse for a bit of blue-lit rumpy-pumpy!

A big reason for the first half being good is the hamming of Connery as Rameriz. He is lively and amusing and it's a shame his involvement was cut short. Lambert is pretty good - although now his trademark laugh is more annoying than endearing! He doesn't manage to bring out the loss and suffering of his character very well at all to be honest. Brown is a much better character - it doesn't require a lot of acting skill but he is enjoying himself playing it up and he really looks the part; where Lambert is a bit dry Brown is like a real spice for the film. Hart is just a bit dippy and not that good in the role.

Overall this is a pretty enjoyable, yet average, fantasy movie. I don't see how this one film managed to spawn as much as it did, and in a way I wish it hadn't, but it is worth seeing once. The soundtrack by Queen and fun performances from Connery and Brown are possible highlights."
432,Fantasia (1940),01-Jan-1940,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['Animation', ""Children's"", 'Musical']"," This unusual and very creative classic of animation combines a very interesting idea with quite a bit of imagination, plus visual effects that still hold up quite well. All but a couple of the sequences are quite enjoyable, and some especially so. Even the segments that don't work as well are usually at least interesting, since you can at least appreciate what they were trying to accomplish.

You don't really have to be all that familiar with the specific pieces of music for it to be worthwhile, since in several cases they chose to match the music with material that is rather different in nature from any original context that it may have had. And in any case, the animated sequences are intended to provide the context, in terms of the movie.

No doubt, everyone will have his or her own favorite segments, based on the music itself and on the choice of accompanying visual material. The ""Sorcerer's Apprentice"" sequence, with Mickey Mouse, is certainly one of the most memorable. The adaptation of ""The Rite of Spring"" is quite imaginative in using an entirely different setting for the music. ""Night on Bald Mountain"" has striking and sometimes bizarre visuals.

Many of the classic Disney features still hold up well as family entertainment, but ""Fantasia"" is unique for its combination of imaginative concept and visual creativity. Not every minute of it works, but that's the price of being willing to experiment. It's an enjoyable and satisfying feature that well deserves to be remembered."
433,Heathers (1989),01-Jan-1989,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Comedy']," Greetings and Salutations,

If you can imagine Jack Nicholsons 'Joker' at high school, he's cool, he's a loner, has a dark mysterious quality . . . oh and he is insane and likes to kill people. Still with me?

Meet J.D, this is Christian Slaters character in Heathers, Slater gives the kind of performance that makes you wish he got cast in 'dark' roles more often. J.D has spawned numerous fan websites and is arguably the greatest teen movie character ever. His lines are spot on and the one scene right at the start of the film where he pulls a gun on the two main school bully's/jocks still brings a smile to my face.

Heathers takes the teen flick concept and ads a new twist. The school characters are perfect right down to the cool kids inventing a new way of speaking just so they stand out even more. You have the nerds, the jocks, the rich kids, the popular kids, the fat victim etc all your standard teen groups are here and happily bouncing along to the beat that life has given them no matter how shallow or cr*p it is.

This is where most movies just continue, and where Heathers excels. Enter J.D, J.D represents everything that every kid ever wanted to do or say and didn't. Not so much a spanner in the works more a bomb!

This film has pages and pages of great quotes and the acting from it's 2 stars is exceptional, Winona Ryder has not made a better film (neither has Shannen Doherty)and the supporting cast play their small but oh so important roles to perfection.

The only pre 25's who will not get this movie are the rich spoilt teens who are oblivious to real life because daddy has always bailed them out or given them everything that they ever wanted (much like the 'rich kid' social group in the film). And as in the film they are largely irrelevant anyway.

Everyone else you must see this movie at least once, it is a classic. You may not love it but you will definitely have an opinion on it.

One quote for the road . . .

In Prayer ""Hi, I'm sorry. Technically I did not kill Heather Chandler, but hey, who am I trying to kid right?. I just want my high school to be a nice place. Amen. Did that sound b1tchy?"""
434,Forbidden Planet (1956),01-Jan-1956,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,['Sci-Fi']," Like THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, this film helped make sci-fi respectable instead of the stuff for silly B-movies with cheap costumes and obviously faked sets. To help strengthen the thought-level of the story, the scriptwriters included elements of Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST, the Biblical story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, and Freudian psychology to make an enlightening tale of other-worldly mystery.

Leslie Nielsen is in his serious mode here long before he became the comic madman of the NAKED GUN movies and POLICE SQUAD television series. It is easy to see the prototypes of much of STAR TREK in this movie. The electronic soundtrack becomes a bit repetitious, but it works well as it is used in the scenes.

The short skirt on the heroine is a bit much but of course ""cheesecake"" was one of the things the cigar-chomping studio suits always liked in the 1950s and still do. Robbie the Robot is thrown in for some comic-relief and appeared in many other movies and television shows including LOST IN SPACE.

The most interesting aspect of the story for me was Monsters from the Id. The point being made is that the serpent is still in the Garden of Eden because we carry evil around with us wherever we go.

This is an excellent entertainment."

These two work so well together that the film would have been impressive no matter what. However, with a smart story and great direction by George Roy Hill, ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" was the smash-hit of 1969 as it achieved box office dominance and won more Oscars (four) than any other film that year. It did not win the Best Picture or Best Director Oscars as ""Midnight Cowboy"" and its director John Schlesinger took home those honors, but it has stood the test of time and is right up there with the other imperative films of that important year (""Midnight Cowboy"", ""Easy Rider"", and ""The Wild Bunch""). The two titled characters are two shrewd outlaws who love to rob trains and banks. However, the law has about had it with the outlaws and the two decide that Bolivia is the place they need to be. Also along for the ride is school-teacher Katharine Ross who obviously has feelings for both men. They both want to go straight in Bolivia, but temptation is too big for them and in the end tragedy will occur for the titled characters. Of course this film is based on real people, but so little is known about them that the film-makers were able to take many liberties with the tale. The film-makers went for comedy and action, but it is the drama and the likable characters that make ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" one of the best films produced in the 1960s. 5 stars out of 5."

The werewolf legend handily serves as that proposition's allegorical vehicle, and compared to the alluded-to Nazi atrocities in two scenes, the legend actually pales. Sadly, under the dark impetus of our arrogance and vanity, our metaphorical ""full moon"", man is perfectly capable of transforming into nightmarish beast.

As a director, Landis approaches Hitchcock in terms of scene economy and symbolism. For example, the opening sequence set on the moors of northern England features the tragic hero David and his friend Jack climbing out of the bed of a truck laden with sheep - benign animals destined for slaughter. Biped ""sheep"" David and Jack meander to ""The Slaughtered Lamb"", a pub sheltering cowering, xenophobic locals from the monster afoot on the moors during full moon. Soon the inhospitality of the town folk compels the two lambs to leave - virtually sending them to their slaughter.

And so it goes throughout this brilliant film. Without revealing the ending, it can be stated that Landis makes his case against the idea that love conquers all; instead, he suggests that love only gives the beast within us pause.

Beware the moon."

He always stretches for originality and his films are so different one from the other. I think this one is highly underrated. If you watch it with an open mind and do not expect it all to make perfect sense you may be surprised about how much you can enjoy it. The 3 D approach gives us some very interesting perspective shots. The dialogues are well written and develop some intriguing ideas. There are echoes of Hitchcock in human/animals interaction. Also some of the scenes could have inspired the Final Destination franchise. There are some very skeptical characters, and that gives the film more credibility. As a curiosity factor, we have a very young Meg Ryan in a funny role. However, I must say: the ending is a little over the top, too absurd for it's own sake. It is like the movie suddenly becomes a total guilty pleasure. But, hey, that is not a bad thing if you enjoy campy, goofy fun. Simply adjust your mind frame for a sudden change of mood and go along for the ride. I have been postponing to watch this one because of the bad ratings and reviews here on Imdb, but today I thought of giving it a chance because I love the director's filmography. I could not be more pleased to acknowledge that Richard Fleischer has not disappointed me yet. Ignore the ratings, take the risk and judge for yourself. This a decent haunted house story with interesting ideas and creative concepts. It tried to do something different and that is always commendable."

This movie starts of with a new family moving in to the house, a father and mother and four kids, two daughters and two sons.

At first everything seem normal, until the strange things start to happen to younger two kids, as the house messed one room up but father dose not believe the kids and then he hits the poor kids, then eldest son, then point a shotgun at is father to make him stop what he doing.

(I have never hated anyone, as much as I hated the father in this movie).

Soon after Sonny the oldest of the sons, start to act a bit at strange and start to feel sick, then while the whole family is out, we see how becomes possessed by the house.

Small spoiler, I liked the scenes, where we see Sonny get possessed by the house,

when we see him screaming in pain, when he stomach he being press down by the unseen evil force, was really good scene, that was scary and really dark

that is one the reason i liked this movie more then first and this is a lot more darker then first movie and the acting was outstanding from everyone

I would have give this movie 10 but I find the ending, a tad boring and disappointing.

so I am going to give this movie a 8 out of 10"

Being a huge horror buff, I just had to and besides I had only seen some of it's absurd sequels. hearing mixed reviews from friends and critics from terrifying to hilarious I turned it on with my boyfriend at the time and prepared myself for something scary. I must say that I was quite impressed. And although slightly disappointed in some of the films scenes ultimately I must say this is one old fashioned scary flick! I can hugely recognize the appeal it had in it's it's hey day. With the exception of Texas chainsaw Massacre, Evil Dead, the Omen and some others I rarely see what people did in their horror classics nowadays. Like The Exorcist, pretty damn boring and funny in my opinion. But getting back to this film. It builds a creeping mood filled with fright inducing suspense. The effects are simple but effective and the performances are somewhat over the top but necessarily wacky. The film's overall lasting appeal has little to do with the film's apparent campiness. it has more to do with the real terror inducing legend that inspired it. Like the Chainsaw remake the new ones looks to amp up the horror and intensity which would be greatly welcomed. Although a great horror classic Amityville's finale is somewhat anti climactic and after a long and impressively scary build-up it fails to deliver the end goods. But whoa some of the scenes from the imaginary friend Jody flying out the window, to the visitor at the door, to the voice in the house and just everything in the basement this film is all about delivering some authentic chills. 8/10"

443,"Birds, The (1963)",01-Jan-1963,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Horror']," The Birds is one of the very few Alfred Hitchcock films that owes more to special effects than to any great story line or acting performances. It's those birds turning on mankind in Bodega Bay that you come to see this film and that's what you get.

Those of the lesser species that mankind hasn't killed off live either in harmony with man or in an undeclared truce. What if a species all of a sudden, previously docile, decides to turn on man? Birds are something we may like or dislike but we do take their passivity in most cases for granted.

It's not hunting or preying birds like the eagle and hawk that do the turning in Bodega Bay, it's scavenger birds like gulls and crows. And they're working together with a kind of unseen intelligence guiding them. That's what's most scary.

The human players Rod Taylor, Tippi Hedren, Suzanne Pleshette, Jessica Tandy and the rest are really of little importance. Everyone does their part well, but their little stories fade to insignificance. The Birds starts as almost a Doris Day/Rock Hudson type comedy as Rod Taylor comes into a pet shop and mistakes Tippi for a salesperson. They have their Rock and Doris like banter and she gets his license number and follows him down to Bodega Bay, a sleepy little California coast village.

The way Hitchcock made Santa Rosa a part of Shadow of a Doubt, he does the same here with Bodega Bay. Unlike in Shadow of a Doubt though the town as well as The Birds dwarf the plot of the film.

As Rod and Tippi do their Rock/Doris thing The Birds start their attacks and turn the place into panic city. As it probably would in any situation. What's really spooky about the whole thing is that Hitchcock leaves it totally unresolved. We don't know what the town will do about these aggressive avians. Or for that matter what mankind itself will do."

It was fun, goofy, contained plenty of laughable dialogue, and, yes, it was actually quite entertaining, in a cheesy sort of way.

Bad-boy actor Steve McQueen, as Steve Andrews, leads the local teenagers into a battle to save their town from being swallowed up by a giant glop of cherry-coloured Jell-O from outer space.

True. The Blob isn't really very good - But, how can you hate a movie a crazy that's as this?

The Blob is definitely worth checking out.

It even features a title song that was written by Burt Bacharach."

446,Burnt Offerings (1976),01-Jan-1976,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Horror']," The film is about a family who comes to live at a creepy mansion for two months. However, throughout the film, there is tons of foreboding music and you know SOMETHING bad is going to happen as the personalities of everyone (but the boy) seems to change the longer they live in the house. Unfortunately, it only really heats up in the last half hour of the movie.

I usually like long movies and can't complain if a film merits a three hour running time or longer. However, at the same time, I hate films that go on too long given that the story is actually very, very simple and just doesn't merit the lengthy running time--like this film. BURNT OFFERINGS is only about two hours long, though it seems like a three hour film because it moves at a snail's pace. At least 45 minutes could have been edited out and the film would have improved as a result of tightening up the script--especially if they'd taken it from the first 2/3 of the movie. For so much of the film, nothing particularly scary or important happens and the tension doesn't exactly build--it slogs along. Now I understand that some of this slower pacing is good for a horror film--you need some build-up--but not THIS much! This was especially bad because the ending was almost exactly what I'd expected about 15 minutes into the film (though the level of blood did surprise me a bit).

Oliver Reed and Karen Black play husband and wife and this casting just seemed odd. Why the English Reed with Ms. Black--especially when their chemistry seemed, at best, awkward? And why did much of Reed's performance (especially late in the film) consist of him shaking convulsively and looking very red-faced (like he was really constipated)? And, why would they include Bette Davis in this film when her role was really rather bland and unimportant? In other words, why is such a great actress given a role that could have been as easily played by any supporting actress or perhaps even a parrot?! As for Lee Montgomery as the boy, he was probably the best in this film. While I hated this child actor in films such as BEN (yuck!!!), here he was decent--and the most credible member of this family--mostly because he didn't seem stupid like his parents!

Overall, this film is creepy and atmospheric but too much emphasis was placed on this. The ""bang"" at the end just didn't provide enough thrills to merit sitting through the previous 90 minutes of bland ""action"". Worth seeing as a time-passer or if you must see everything Miss Davis ever did (even her poorer films of the 1970s), otherwise this one is easy to skip."
447,Carrie (1976),01-Jan-1976,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Horror']," This film probably speaks to anyone who was bullied or humiliated in high school, and there's great power in its well-known dramatic scene. It's entertaining in a campy sort of way, but Stephen King's writing and Brian De Palma's direction are both so unsubtle that the interesting premise isn't very elevated in execution. That's too bad, because Sissy Spacek is memorable as the title character, Piper Laurie is strong as her overbearing mother, and there are several others in the supporting cast of interest, including John Travolta and Amy Irving.

Unfortunately, the story is too simple, and its characters are too extreme. The mother practices religion straight out of the 16th century, the kids in high school are so cruel they'll kill a pig with a sledgehammer, and it's not enough that the picked on girl is so awkward, she also has to have an incredibly powerful psychic ability. Meanwhile De Palma's ogling in the ridiculous shower scene, obsession with referencing Hitchcock, and tendency to prolong scenes gave the film an amateur feeling. Loved the jump scare towards the end, that was a nice touch, and this film is worth seeing, but it's far from great."

Harvey Stephens was the perfect choice to play Damien ""cute but evil"". The Scene where he looks at the dog and waves is just a classic! and then there is the score...Jerry Goldsmith won a well deserved Oscar for this movie in which he created two excellent themes ""Ave Satani"" and ""Piper Dreams"" which carry this movie along with brilliance.

People seem to always compare this movie to ""The Exorcist""....why???, The Exorcist is a classic all on it's own. The Omen deals with a completely different subject to The Exorcist, while The Exorcist deals with possession, The Omen deals with the child of the devil 'the antichrist'.

The Omen has one thing The Exorcist does not have ""a classic score"". The Exorcist used Tubular Bells with great effect which actually was never written for the movie. The Score written for The Exorcist is still vertically unknown to this day.

The movie opens with the silhouette of a young boy, the shadow of which gradually turns into a cross. It's simple, yet very chilling, and sets the tone. We then meet Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck). It's Rome, and it's 6am, on the 6th day on the 6th month. His wife Kathy (Lee Remick) has just given birth to a child, which died almost immediately. At the hospital a priest named Spiletto convinces him to secretly adopt a child, whose mother died during childbirth. Thorn agrees and keeps it a secret from his wife. They name the child Damien. Thorn is then promoted, from American Ambassador to Italy to Ambassador to Great Britain. We see the happy family in London, the perfect life. It however all starts to go wrong at Damien's fifth birthday party and to make matters worse Damien's adopted father Robert Thorn eventually learns that he is actually the devil's son (The Antichrist).

This movie is a horror classic and will remain a classic for many year to come.

449,Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979),01-Jan-1979,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Sci-Fi']"," The first Star Trek film of 1979 is an exciting, expansive and rather tense first foray into feature length filmmaking for the popular franchise - a bold going where very few, if any, television shows had gone before. There's a polished sense of spectacle, adventure and smarts all wrapped up into one about it; a sheen of precision and careful planning about the production ‚Äì a sense of craft to it. Indeed, ""The Motion Picture"" rather than ""the movie"", or anything else for that matter, is a perfect subtitle for something that has a swagger about it; a piece that has pretensions to be something a little more than your average space adventure blast 'em up, without possessing much in the way of arrogance that comes with a self-conscious knowledge that it's heading down this respective route. The film is set in a distant future further still within deepest of deep space, and yet its chief source of spectacle arrives in the form of the speaking; reasoning and communication between a number of its characters, most notably its protagonist and new-found antagonist during the final act.

The film follows a relatively familiar, if unspectacular, singular line framework, for sure - in that regular battles must be conquered along the way to ending where they do and that the individual misunderstandings crew members have with each other need to be resolved, but it is remarkable how by the time the final act as arrived, the piece is willing to abstain from conventional conclusion. We begin with the focusing on what will come to form as the film's primary source for plight: a huge energy cloud thousands of miles away from an Earth, whose own measurements of time has seen it reach the 23rd century. We observe some spaceships passing by, our eye unsure on what to focus on as lingering shots of the crafts and the distinct turrets that stick up out of them capture our gaze more than anything. A cut inside reveals some ugly looking creatures using an alien language and distinct technology, technology they use to attack the large purple energy cloud before it itself wipes them out with relative ease. The desired effect of lingering on space ships we have never before encountered, and therefore require time so a to become familiarised with them, before cutting inside to reveal the ugly creatures said edit reveals and concluding the process by having those creatures killed off, is an effective procedure establishing distinct hierarchy within this new world and immediately implements this glowing energy cloud at the centre of all the film's tension and wonder.

Director Robert Wise has effectively blended a slow-burning approach to telling a space adventure with an overall narrative framework of race-against-time. The cloud is heading for Earth; it's unstoppable; nobody knows what it is or what it wants and thus far, has only reacted aggressively to what it's encountered. Luckily for Earth based space programme organisation Starfleet, the one ship nearby and able to head on out to intercept and investigate is the famed U.S.S. Enterprise harboured at its sunny, welcoming, radiant and busy-bodied San Fransisco headquarters; far away from the large, open, gloomy, ominous locales of the previous sequences. Said ship is, of course, headed up by its chief: a certain Admiral named James Kirk played, as in the TV show of the 1960s, by William Shatner, somebody whom storms in unopposed and assumes control from acting captain Willard Decker (Collins) thus nicely teeing up the friction existing between the two of them thereafter. The film also makes decent use of a back-burning item in the form of The Enterprise's overall physical state, its potential to malfunction ominous when we recall what the energy cloud is capable of to fully functioning ships; the death of two people trying to use the transporter beams rather-a stark forcing home of this.

The crew will eventually come to be made up of varying people of varying ethnicities, in that an African American; a Hmong man; a young Aryan; etc. will form the nucleus of the ship's diverse operators, successfully getting across a sense of the whole thing being a multicultural effort. Also along for the ride is Indian actress Persis Khambatta's alien life-form named Ilia, who's given a Lieutenant rank and shares a romantic history with the demoted Decker. Of the original crew, a foil arrives for Kirk in the form of the ship's doctor named Bones McCoy (Kelley), whereas male specimen of the Vulcan race variety Mr. Spock (Nimoy) comes aboard when he is drawn to the cloud due to the effect it had on his usually transparent emotional state. Wise shoots the unveiling of The Enterprise, as it undergoes repair work in a series of longing close ups. Kirk and one of his engineers very slowly veer up to it in a transport pod, the reaction on Kirk's face and a general sense of awe is inferred onto the audience, namely the die hard fans of the show, so as to help along the reaction as The Enterprise is revealed on the big screen for the very first time. Wise shoots what feels like all corners of the ship, from all possible angles and compositions, as people stand around it on apparatus seeing to it: a literal repair job for what's happening within the film, a metaphorical preparation/revealing job as the final touches are made and the big reveal is made.

The film is a surprisingly remarkable piece of drama, with Wise wedging great peril out of the simplest of ideas such as the being on collision course with a small but devastatingly effective asteroid as well as some uncanny happenings during other encounters which are instead helped along by the special effects that greatly enhance the ominous predicaments, rather than just cruelly ageing film and sapping out drama. The film is engaging and workmanlike enough in equal measure to work as both decent escapism and as smart, brooding science fiction."

So, 12 years after having first seen Star Trek V, and thinking it was bizarrely bad, I gave it a second watch, hoping I would find some redeeming quality which I missed the first time around.

I didn't.

The writing is half-baked, and although at first the quality of the acting is stable enough to keep the movie on its feet (albeit shakily), the further we get into the plot the sillier it gets. The last quarter of the film is just plain ridiculous. What was even worse, from the original cast's POV, is that this was the first ST movie to be released AFTER the franchise returned to television with Next Generation, and the average episode of Next Generation would put this to shame* - including the special effects! What an embarrassment.

The Final Frontier isn't thoroughly wretched - I gave it 4 out of 10 - but it's so far below the standard of its predecessors (yes, including the first one) that the only reason I can think of to watch it is because you'll appreciate the other movies more.

According to IMDB and the film itself, it was filmed at Sea World in Orlando. Well, Orlando is about 90 minutes from the ocean....and there is no way ANY shark could attack there as there are only lakes around the property. I am sure that a lot of other Floridians had to laugh at this as well.

The first portion of ""Jaws 3-D"" wasn't that bad. Sure, there were some cheap 3-D tricks reminscent of ""SCTV"" and their 'Dr. Tongue' skits....but the story wasn't too stupid. However as the film progressed, the 3-D stunts got worse as did the horrid underwater sequences and, especially, the plot. We are to believe that a 35 foot Great White shark is angry because its baby was killed (sharks have zero maternal instinct by the way) and it attacks and destroys much of an underwater sea park...and, it growls!! The premise is ridiculous and the whole thing is carried off in the crappiest possible way. For examples, as people are supposedly walking around in tunnels under the sea, it's obvious that the external shots were sloppily added later....and when you see subs and other things under the water, it's obvious they were done using a green screen and VERY poorly added later. On the big screeen this must have been paritcularly jarring to watch! As for the shark itself, despite nearly a decade between this film and the original ""Jaws"", the shark manages to look even LESS lifelike! This is especially true in the ultra-slow motion scene towards the end when it smashes the control room...and ultimately meets its doom. You just have to see it to believe it!!

Overall, a dopey movie with abominable special effects. One positive thing, however, about the film...it proves that acting in such a movie will NOT necessarily kill your career or your reputation. Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett, for example, managed to make this pile of crap and still have some self-respect. Strangely, despite all its many deficiencies...the movie still managed to make money!!

If you didn't know, this movie is currently #60 on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List. I can how it made it, as the list consists of the worst major releases and even after 36 years, folks STILL remember it and hate it. A terrible film."

This story broke my heart caused it reminded me my own story, when i was 8 years old, i was sexual harrased by my uncle (remember car scene? It happened to me)then he tried to rape me once, i lived in shame because of his bad touches, but when you are a kid you live afraid, and by that time i was visiting my aunt, so i just spent a couple of months there, my parents were abroad and so was my older sister, i thank god she didn't go through what i went through, i never told anyone till a couple of months ago, i'm 18 years old now and i thank god that he didn't rape me, and believe me he tried more than once, and he had many chances but lucky me something always came up to stop him. Now i can say i got over that, but it's difficult for me to rely on someone else, especially men, and i can say i'm always watching and asking questions to my cousins if anyone is touching them in a bad way, so this story and my story have helped me to be more careful towards children, cause they are always afraid to speak about these things, so my advice is that this is something real, it happened to me and happens to other children, so my advice is ""watch out"" cause these things happen more often than people think, and specially inside the own families"

The plot is pretty stupid, so the film is for action film buffs only. Lots and lots of stuff blows up.

Don't normally like martial arts films? Me neither. Too much anger and foreign strangeness about ungrateful sons and fathers. But Jackie Chan is quite different and if you're new to the genre I suggest you give it a shot. Jackie Chan films have lots of comedy and they're quite accessible. But try ""SuperCop"" or ""Rush Hour"" first.

Who should see this film:

-- Action film buffs only, even if like me you prefer an

intelligent plot. The comedy and action makes up for it.

As a baby, Haru (Farley) appeared on the coastal shores of Japan. Legend has it that a foreigner would arrive and become the greatest ninja ever, known as the ""Great White Ninja."" As Haru grew, it became apparent: he was not the one. But when a beautiful stranger named Sally (Nicollette Sheridan) appears at the Jojo seeking a ninja's help, Haru finds his calling. Through a series of mix-ups (generally caused by Haru himself), Haru is framed for murder and he follows Sally to Beverly Hills to set things right. Finding out Sally's boyfriend is a counterfeiter and murderer, Haru with the help of hotel bellboy Joey (Chris Rock) and unknowingly with the help of his ninja brother Gobei (Robin Shou) takes down the counterfeit ring and finds his place among the ninja clan. Beverly Hills Ninja is full of individual comic gags that are hilarious in their purity--call it sadistic, but sometimes it's just plain funny watching a guy unwittingly walk into a lamppost while carrying on a conversation. Farley was a master at these tried-and-true gags, which reach right back into the origins of comedy. But it's not all slapstick; a scene where Haru is so taken by dancers at a local strip bar that he joins in is reminiscent of the mud-wrestling scene from Stripes. Beverly Hills Ninja may be considered a low-brow romp, but a romp it is nonetheless."

It isn't often that a movie makes you both Sad and happy at the same time and makes you want to stand up and cheer at the ending, but FREE WILLY was one of the few movies that did it. Willy and Jesse met again in FREE WILLY 2 and it was great to see them together again, but unfortunately the enterprising premise (involving an oil spill in the ocean endangering Willy and his Family) turned out to be a bit too slow-paced and in some cases too hokey (like the scene where Jesse and Willy re-unite again after the first time Jesse plays the harmonica...it could have been thought out better). Also the film spent too much time dealing with the issues of Jesse's new Step-brother, Elvis. However, the suspenseful last half-hour of the movie was great. Which brings us to Part 3 which is actually almost as good as the first film and a lot better than part 2. The storyline (involving the wrongful and illegal hunting of Whales and Jesse & Randolph's quest to stop a crew of nasty hunters) is very well written and emotionally charged like the first movie. I wish this film was marketed and advertised better because it really deserves to be seen! It is emotional and heartfelt like the magic of the first FREE WILLY and in the end you will stand up and cheer. It's cool to see what has become of Jesse and how he has grown up and it is good to know that Jesse and Randolph will always stick together to do what is right! If you passed on this because you were afraid that it was more of the same, guess again! It is another wonderful story that deserves to be enjoyed again and again! Check it out!!!"
458,Nixon (1995),01-Jan-1995,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," Who could have possibly thought that Oliver Stone would surpass the level reached by ""JFK"", one of the greatest political thrillers ever made? Yet his ""Nixon"" is not only the harrowing political biography of the most controversial and unpopular President of the United States, but also the gripping psychological study of a tormented man who got too much to prove. It's also a terrific movie served by an impressive casting: Anthony Hopkins, Joan Allen, James Woods, Bob Hoskins, Ed Harris, E.G. Marshall, Madeline Kahn and an unrecognizable Paul Sorvino as Henry Kissinger. And it's definitely one of the best movies of 1995, which is saying a lot.

""Nixon"" borrows a lot of elements from ""JFK"" on the editing department, swinging back and forth from childhood memories to the present, from the Watergate scandal to its dark premises. The film is complex, almost confusing but never gratuitously because Nixon himself happens to be an enigmatic and larger-than-life character. Roger Ebert even compared the film to ""Citizen Kane"", establishing an interesting parallel between Richard Nixon and Charles Foster Kane. Nixon does remind of Kane in his excesses, his capability to be disdained by the establishment yet respected within his inner circle, and his heart consumed by an unconscious desire to be loved while trying to hide a torment deeply rooted in his childhood.

The comparison is even truer because like Kane, Nixon hides a terrible secret, although the missing eighteen minutes from the White House recordings would unveil something more unpleasant than the mysterious 'Rosebud'. Behind every great man, there's a secret, but in Nixon's case, there's also a woman. And as Pat Nixon, Joan Allen delivers a subtle but pivotal performance as the woman who evolves in her husband's shadow but in her own supportive way, acts as the only guardian angel of a man who sold his soul to a certain Machiavellian view of power. She believes in his talent to win the election, but not the hearts, people would never love him because she knows how uneasy it was for her to love him.

The chronicles of a man who could never be loved, that could be indeed the subtitle of Nixon's journey in the White House, in his whole political career actually. Indeed, Nixon won two elections, opened China, signed a nuclear treaty with Russia, ended the longest war America ever knew, but as great achievements as they were, Nixon's dark side eclipsed them: Vietnam, Cambodia, Allende, the Watergate. In his most lucid moments, Nixon even recognizes that his road to success was paved by dead bodies, he could go to college because his older brother died of tuberculosis, Jack Kennedy was assassinated, then Bobby, his luck carried the seeds of his doom. This is when the comparison with ""JFK"" stops, it's not an investigation but a character study.

And as Dick Nixon, Anthony Hopkins never tries to make an impersonation but rather creates his own personification of an eternal outcast, haunted by the ghosts from the past, a man who always had to forge his carapace, by building his own legend through his modest Quaker background ""in the poorest farm of California"", always using it as an alibi to justify that he's one of the 'little people'. And when an outcast experiments the power, and tastes its irreplaceable savor after the post-War republican wave, he can't renounce it. Nixon knew he was born to rule the most powerful country of the world, like a personal revenge: ""Only if you have been in the deepest valley, can you ever know how magnificent it is to be on the highest mountain."" This taste for revenge is his inner demon.

I'm not comparing two characters, but ""Nixon"" kind of reminded me of ""Downfall"" in the way the White House is showed, as a sort of bunker where the state's ugliest secrets are covered, a shadowy and gloomy place waiting for the enemy (here the media) to come to the leader. And one by one, like a sinking ship, every faithful soldier is drown in the scandal, and Nixon, as the Captain, is the last to leave. Ebert wrote about Bruno Ganz' performance as Hitler: ""Admiration I did not feel. Sympathy I felt in the sense that I would feel it for a rabid dog, while accepting that it must be destroyed."" In a lesser measure of course, I think this could work as the right answer to those who believed that Stone, a notorious left wing, created empathy toward Nixon.

Stone never used his patriotism at the expenses of intelligence. Nixon is responsible of his downfall but a whole system is to blame, Nixon was flawed but his enemies weren't nobler. And that's what Stone brilliantly denounces. In many scenes, Nixon reminds the Press of its lack of objectivity, its obsession and outspoken hatred. These words are still relevant today; Nixon is the quintessential incarnation of the 'person we love to hate'. Indeed, with his victory sign trademark, his sweating and angry look contrasting with Kennedy's shining smile, from his ""I'm not a crook"" to his dog Checkers, from his resignation to ""The Simpsons"" (he even inspired through his middle-name the name of Milhouse) to hold-up masks, he's in his way, an icon of popular culture, or unpopular if you prefer.

Nixon appears as an individual whose republican obedience veiled his true idealism, his fascination for Lincoln, the President who ended the Civil War, or Kennedy as a beloved figure. People look at Kennedy and want to be him, but when they look at them, they find Nixon, less than a low self-esteem; it's a sentiment of total waste that invades his heart when he look at Kennedy's picture during his last night in the White House. Nixon's tragedy is America's, and maybe that's why he was loathed, because people don't want to look at themselves."
459,"Cry, the Beloved Country (1995)",01-Jan-1995,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," Get out your Kleenexes, folks. This heavy drama is a massive tearjerker. After the credits rolled, I remember crying for half an hour; thankfully, I was home alone at the time. Even if you're not a parent, this movie will tug on your heart.

There was an original version in 1951, but it was very low-budget and simply made. The remake focuses on the real meat of the story, of two fathers connecting over the bond of their sons. In South Africa, set during the 1940s, James Earl Jones plays a minister with a wonderful heart who has set a good example for his son. Unfortunately, he soon discovers that his son is missing, on the run from law. When he sets on a journey to find and exonerate him, he meets another missing boy's father, Richard Harris. Richard is prejudiced, but as he's forced to spend time with James to find out what happened to his son, he learns many lessons.

The title tells you to cry, and cry you will. Some performances are so emotional, I feel embarrassed to see the actors putting themselves in such vulnerable positions. Admittedly a double-standard, I always find it much more tragic and effective to see men cry. In essence, this movie turns me into a puddle. Watch at your own risk, but you'll see some fantastic performances if you do."
460,"Crossing Guard, The (1995)",01-Jan-1995,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," I have to take exception to what seems the be the majority view that this is an excellent film. The whole thing is contrived and phony. Throughout, there are innumerable points in the action where people do things and behave in ways completely contrary to what real people would do. The dialogue, too, is contrived. And one could have asked some more subtlety. As it is, it is clear from the get go that the vengeful father is the ""bad"" guy and the repentant killer is the ""good"" guy. Things are rarely so black and white. There is one scene further on in the film where Nicholson's character, in a conversation with his ex-wife, portrays some genuine grief and pain, but his portrayal up to that point completely belies that. And the many observations by viewers about the excessive and gratuitous nudity are on the mark. The completely contrived and unbelievable ending brings to mind Oscar Wilde's quote that ""one would have to have a heart of stone not to dissolve into tears ...of laughter.""

Sean Penn should stick to his day job of acting and stay away from writing and directing."
461,Smoke (1995),01-Jan-1995,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," From the Miramax logo that opens it, Smoke is very much of a piece with 90s faux-indy films in the vein of Pulp Fiction or Clerks. It shares a lot of traits with this wave of films: great actors, somewhat affected dialogue, a shaky portrayal of race and a distinct sense of machismo (although not nearly as nauseating as, say, Swingers). Where Smoke differs is in rejecting the violent nihilism that often haunted this decade. Instead, this is a story about communities forming and the minor miracle that is everyday survival.

Smoke is ostensibly centred around an ordinary corner smoke shop in New York City. We follow the shop, and the people around it, over the course of a year. There's a really laudable desire here to tell the story of a social environment rather than an individualist narrative. This is a goal that the film never quite fulfills, meandering into some fairly standard family drama with a refreshing lack of narrative closure. Even when the scenario would suggest melodrama, the overall focus of the film is not on what happens to our protagonists but the bonds that form between them.

The performances are as great as you would expect from reading the cast list, although Stockard Channing's character is too underwritten for her to really shine. The script is by novelist Paul Auster, eschewing most of his postmodern experimentation for street-level human drama. (There is still a novelist named Paul with a dead wife, so I guess some things never change). Auster's dialogue is usually authentic-sounding, save for the tendency to drift into stagey monologues that never really justify themselves.

As a film, Smoke is something of a failure -- it's unable to create the sense of place it aims for without relying on hoary story lines and drama. But there's also a lot to like about the film, from the brilliant cast to the relaxed pace. It's not all it could be, but it still deserves a look."

The problem isn't the central performance of Jeni Courtney as Fiona, which is outstandingly good, or the rest of the cast who must have frozen their assets impressively filming the lives of poor fishermen on the East Atlantic foreshore. More power to them. The kid playing the lost boy Jamie, Cillian Byrne (who didn't trouble the costume department), is also amazing, the way he (apparently) steers that floating cradle; and the scene with the seal and him having 'tea' is tremendous. But essentially this is a children's film, a sort of 'Railway Children' with Irish pipes and seals. Lots of Irish pipes. Lots of seals. Lots of seagulls. Lots of cold-looking water and rowboats. Lots of beaches, grass and flowers. Yet more Irish music. The only real suspense is whether there's a happy ending or not, which I won't give away, but no-one ever doubts that Fiona's story of what she has seen is true. Fair enough, they're simple people who believe in faery folk, but it all seems a bit cut-and-dried in the end. At the beginning, there's too much exposition from blarney-gushing Oirish characters, the late middle segue sequence goes on a bit too long and the pacing tends to slow up towards the end. But it's a genuine, well-made, innocent sort of film that you can safely let your smallest kids watch. The sort of film to rent at Xmas, or Easter. Especially if there's any Irish in you, or you particularly like seals. Much better than 'Ryan's Daughter', btw."

It is so moving and wondrous. Beautiful performances abound and it is just terrific. I watched it after reacquainting myself with My Dinner With Andre. Tremendously moving and touching. So thrilled to own it and to be able to dive back in now and again and experience the work of gifted and deep people doing something beautiful and rich. Magnificent. Highly recommended! Wallace is just miraculous as is everyone else. This is what artistic work is about. Everybody in the arts wants to make a Citizen Kane and a Sgt. Peppers, a Le Sacre Du Printemps and a West Side Story, a Sweeney Todd and an Angels In America. Andre Gregory's direction and goal seems to be to find a level of communication and depth in the work that is both heightened and yet ultra realistic at the same time; in the end analysis the film therefore is affecting in a way that many productions aren't. He achieves this by working on a smaller scale yet allowing the actors all the room they need to get big when the play demands it. It reminds anyone involved in the arts that the process is everything. Doing good work with all your heart, mind and soul down to the smallest detail is all we can ask of ourselves. Within that there will be artists able to push through and be a part of something transcendent. This film is a lost gem. It didn't and it won't make a big noise. It doesn't matter, it has everything it needs to have to remind anyone who is able to take it in what the arts are all about, especially the theatrical arts. Forgive the sermon. Watch it."

If so, watch The Jungle Book live version. I really enjoyed it. This movie has so much action and suspense and follows the same storyline as the cartoon version but with so much more detail. The movie is about a boy named Mowgli who is taken away from his village after a tiger attack. He gets stuck on a runaway wagon that is on fire. After he manages to get off of the wagon he is too far away from his village and no one can find him. Mowgli is raised by a pack of wolves and grows up with a panther and a bear named Baloo. Eventually, he is found by civilization and his childhood love named Kitty. He then has to learn how to fit in with everyone. My favorite character in the movie is Mowgli because he tries really hard to fit in with everyone once he is found. He also tries really hard to always protect Kitty. He is a really good fighter and climber. My favorite part in this movie is when Mowgli finds a secret hideout where a lot of monkeys live. It is packed with mountains of treasures. He finds a dagger but then a snake pops out and tries to kill Mowgli. So Mowgli fights with the snake and eventually uses the dagger to kill the snake. It is really suspenseful. I recommend this movie for ages 6 and up. Younger kids might get scared watching this movie because there is a lot of fighting and suspense. Credit: Anthony Aranda, age 9, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic."
466,Red Rock West (1992),01-Jan-1992,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,['Thriller']," Red Rock West is directed by John Dahl who also co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Rick. It stars Nicolas Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle, J. T. Walsh and Timothy Carhart. Music is by William Olvis and cinematography by Marc Reshovsky.

When a promised job in Wyoming fails to materialise on account of an injury sustained in combat, Michael Williams (Cage) drifts into the town of Red Rock and is mistaken in a bar for a hit-man hired to kill an unfaithful wife. Tempted by the high cash on offer, Michael plays along and promptly finds himself in a web of intrigue from which escape is looking unlikely¬Ö

Welcome To Red Rock/You Are Now Leaving Red Rock.

The studio didn't know what to do with it, a neo-noir flavoured with contemporary Western spices. Put out on cable in America and thriving on its limited release in Europe, it started to gain a cult fan-base. More so after a theatre in the Frisco Bay area started showing it and it made considerable coinage. Today it still remains more of a cult piece than anything else, which while it deserves more accolades and exposure, is still kind of nice for the fans, because it's like we have our own little neo-noir treasure all to ourselves.

Red Rock West is essential for the neo-noir heads and well worthy of inspection by the average modern day crime film fan. Plot wise it's a bit, shall we say iffy? Yet the twists, turns and characterisations are so deftly constructed and performed, it matters not a jot. Cage's ex- marine is an honest and decent guy who whilst down on his luck - punished for his honesty - finds himself in a vortex of mystery and murder that he can't escape from. His companions in this scenario are film noir staples, the femme fatale (Boyle) with a smoulder as big as her secret, the hit-man (Hopper) with a glint in his eye to accompany his callous leanings, and the shifty bar owner (Walsh) trying to off his wife whilst keeping his shady cards close to his chest.

As the tricksy plot unfolds in a haze of bad judgements and untruths, further pulsed by the vagaries of fate, it becomes apparent that Dahl wants us to know it isn't taking itself too seriously. There's a glorious scent of dark humour hanging in the air, an unpretentiousness about the whole thing that's refreshing. The look and feel is perfect for the narrative, the colour is stripped back to create a moody atmospheric surround, while the score and sound-tracking immediately brings to mind country and western tales of woe. Dahl knows his noir onions, but this is not just a homage hat tipper to the past, he understands what works in noir, be it the blending of the quirky with the edgy, or scene setting in locales such as a colourless bar and a foggy cemetery, Dahl gets the key ingredients right to deliver the goods wholesale.

The small cast come up trumps. Boyle as Suzanne Brown is weak if her femme fatale is pitted against the likes of Matty Walker or Bridget Gregory, but it's an adequate performance that doesn't hinder the picture. She is helped enormously, though, by having to share most scenes with Cage who brings his ""A"" game. Consistently inconsistent throughout his career, Cage, when on form is a joy to watch, here he gets to thrive as a put upon hero, shifting seamlessly between confusion and boldness, where incredulous looks are the order of the day with a side order of eccentric intensity. Hopper does what he does so well, amusing villainy, while Walsh is effortlessly menacing and suspicious. In small secondary support Carhart and country star Dwight Yoakam leave favourable impressions.

This is not an edge of your seat thriller, or a cranium bothering piece of dramedy, it's neo-noir done right. Where morality is grey at best and money is the root of all evil, it's slick, playful, cold blooded and absorbing. Hooray! 9/10"
467,"Bronx Tale, A (1993)",01-Jan-1993,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," Here is a realistic-looking and an involving story of the street life in New York City's Bronx section in the 1950s and 1960s. Excellent acting and a good job of re-creating the era and site's atmosphere are main things going for this film. Also the soundtrack is very, very good. The main problem I have with the film is the fact that a cold-blooded killer is made to be the hero - a guy that you root for! Unbelievable.

Playing that killer is Chazz Palminteri, who outperforms the more famous and great actor and co-star Robert De Niro. Actually, the co-star is Lilo Brancoto, who was recently in the news for allegedly committing a major crime himself.

Anyway, supposedly this is Palminteri's story of his childhood and features him as a young boy and then as a 17-year-old. He has a straight father (De Niro) but looks up to the area's Mafia leader ""Sonny"" (Palminteri), who takes the kid under his wing for not ratting on him when he witnessed him killing someone.

It may have a bad message, and gives a couple shots at the Catholic Church along the way, but the characters and the story keeps one tuned to the screen for the full two hours. It was good to see De Niro play the honest, hard-working bus driver who wants his kid to have character and not emulate the local hoods.

This is a not a movie for those who wince at the f-word because it's used frequently. This is more of man's movie, really, with males dominating and some good advice on dating and what to look for in women! ""Sonny,"" despite being a killer, is shown to be a caring, compassionate guy who cares about young ""Calogero"" (Brancoto, and earlier as a 9-year-old played by Francis Capra).

There are so many mixed messages in here - good and bad - it would make your head swim, but it is a crime film very much worth investigating."
468,Rudy (1993),01-Jan-1993,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," Rather than repeat the many parallels to Rocky etc., or concentrate on the underdog prevails theme which is obvious, Rudy's value reaches beyond himself. Football is a team sport and though Rudy may become a mediocre component of the team from a strictly athletic point of view, his dedication and doggedness actually provide the team with an intangible ingredient.

The inspirational speeches Rudy practices repeating early on are more or less done as a fan of Notre Dame. His efforts when actually there transcend the fan and become inspirational by example. The story may be rather simple and the ending predictable, but what's wrong with a true-life based account that makes one feel good? A movie I would recommend dragging one's children to see. They may not like or understand football, but that is not what it is really about. It is about values, and good ones at that.

The chances of this being shown on MTV are slim."
469,Short Cuts (1993),01-Jan-1993,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," This is without a doubt my favorite Robert Altman movie!!! The immense amount of acting talent in the film is incredible!! All of the different story lines pan out to whereby a myriad of instances effectively depict how people really are, and not how they perceive themselves to be!! The emotional augmentation of introverted feelings and quirky lifestyles in ""Short Cuts"" manifest themselves to a point of rudimentary selfishness with virtually every one of the pivotal characters in the film!! The lack of a necessary and preliminary confrontation with everybody ultimately leads to a copious quantity of latent hostilities!!! Taciturn proclivities become a lethal weapon for all of the running characters in this movie!! ..Social mediocrity is not just about an inadequate household income, or a meager pecuniary net worth, but also, how the average person lacks the psychological stamina to candidly assume his position on any given issue, whether it be personal, political or otherwise!! Robert Altman itemizes a devious element of human interaction that ruthlessly erupts a plethora of instances which illustrate a mollified functional insanity through a fusillade of formidable and tumultuous bits and pieces!! I for one, found this approach to be extremely intriguing!! I indulged the entire genre of this film with a macabre enthusiasm. An integral motif to this movie became a case of everyone's situation getting relegated to the despondent plight of accepting the ramifications of avoidable character inadequacies!!

Let's delve into some of the characters: You had a lot of the ""Sex, Lies and Videotape"" cast (Andie McDowell and Peter Gallagher)With them, you encountered a lot of the same agitated torment!! Jack Lemmon had a bit role, he was very believable as an apathetic prototype of the fragmented curmudgeon!! Lily Tomlin exemplified the impervious lower middle class deviate to an empathetic state of reasonable plausibility in this film!! She was constantly stalemated by everyone around her, and ultimately became the proverbial victim of her isolated environment!! The typical L.A. Cop was so believable!! He thought he was God's gift to the world! As a matter of fact, all of the segments in ""Short Cuts"" were superbly executed, however,the segment I found to be the most fascinating was the YUPPIE couple that this movie paired off!! (Julianne Moore and Matthew Modine) They were the urban W.A.S.P.'s who became afflicted by modern immorality!! Attempting to be appropriately ""Liberal"", their basically provincial ideas inhibited them from properly communicating with each other!! This revelation emanated a volatile rancor which was about as subtle as the United States surprise attack of nuclear fireworks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of WWII!! All of the correlating plots to ""Short Cuts"" are intertwined, one picking up where the other one left off, as they all seem to be tossing around a Frisbee of absolute moral oblivion and debauchery!!

SO!! What was the resonating potpourri of philosophies in this movie? What was the aggregate collage of convoluted ethics? What was the proletariat's's pot luck stew of calamity here? As it turns out, the most crucial dilemmas in ""Short Cuts"" were the inane ones: No birthday cake!! My wife is not wearing underwear because she thinks she's one of her paintings!! The ubiquitous and arrogant attitude of ""Because I said so!!"" I need a part time job, how about phone sex? The utterly trite and solicitous plea of ""It should not be that difficult to understand that I just do not want to accept responsibility!!"" Enmity in my present and previous domiciles is the prevailing villain for motivating my belligerence!! Last but not least, we all got away with something!! Watch the movie to find out what!! Robert Altman's compendium of cosmopolitan neurotics evokes a precarious form of nauseating reality for all parties concerned!! I thought this film was excellent because the characters were all indisputably self serving!! Add insult to injury, they were not even good at it!! Such a peculiar depiction of these thwarted individuals throws caution to the wind about receiving an Oscar, and focuses more on Altman's quest for professional integrity!! The petty preoccupations of such non-corresponding individuals, as demonstrated in ""Short Cuts"", would indicate that perhaps the most coveted accolade in which Robert Altman wanted to be the recipient of was one of accomplishing a unique perspective of audited emotional reality!!!! ""M*A*S*H was Alman's trophy case movie, ""Short Cuts"" is more of an alternative film which spurred on a heinous angle of domestic identification!! Whether they are burdened with financial problems or not, everyone in this film is seeking an unearned gratification of one form or another!! ""Short Cuts"" is very similar to the movie ""Crash"" I am probably one of the few people who likes it better, ""Short Cuts"" engages in an insidious perspective of human behavior on an intellectual level. People's afflictions in ""Short Cuts"" were cerebral!! In the movie ""Crash"" they were about violence!! More movies should pinpoint the pejorative aspects of human nature like ""Short Cuts"" did!! People are more like this movie portrays them to be than they are on generic television programs!! I guess convictions and societal accountability are just entirely too much trouble!!"
470,Tombstone (1993),01-Jan-1993,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,['Western']," When you think of the 'Wild, Wild West', saloons, sheriffs, shoot-outs, and cowboys are some of the things you might think of as essential to painting a portrait of the old west. Well, this movie shows just that, but not in a cheesy, run of the mill sort of way. This is the story of Tombstone.

Tombstone stars Kurt Russell as the legendary Wyatt Earp, the U.S. Marshall known for 'keeping the peace'. He and his two brothers Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Morgan (Bill Paxton) decide to head out to the town of Tombstone. It's a place where you can make it rich and quick, too. Wyatt decides to grab a share of the local saloon/casino called The Oriental. Making all of this money and having a good time is all they want to think about. They just want to leave they're past behind them. Doc Holiday (Val Kilmer) wants to do the same thing. With his lung condition worsening, he is trying to live life to the fullest...that is gambling, drinking, smoking, and doing his ""marital duties"" with his wife Kate. A traveling group of actors and performers roll into town put on a show for Tombstone. Josephine Marcus (Dana Delaney) and Mr. Fabian (Billy Zane) sweep the town off of their feet with their charm and talents. Josephine is attracted to Wyatt's ruggedness and mystery. Wyatt tries not to be tempted even though his drug addicted girl friend doesn't help his cause much. With all of this going on in Tombstone it seems like it will be easy sailing for Wyatt and his crew...until they have a run in with the Cowboys.

Led by Curly Bill Brocious (Powers Boothe), this gang has been terrorizing the west for a number of years. They are the law in the town of Tombstone. They influence everything from the sheriff to the saloons. When the local marshal is shot by Curly Bill, Wyatt locks him up this is when the cowboys start to make trouble. Virgil and Morgan soon sign up as the new Sheriff's in town and Wyatt doesn't want any part of it. Doc has become enemies with one of the quickest and skilled guns in the west named Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn). When Wyatt is forced into help keep the peace, there is the showdown at the O.K. Carral that would just become more of the legend of Wyatt Earp and his band of law men.

Tombstone is a great film with a lot of action, drama, and even some comedic moments. The screenplay is fantastic with Wyatt Doc having some great conversations. Russell, Kilmer, Elliott, and Paxton all give good performances. Kilmer especially shows his range as an actor with his charm and charisma not scene in this way before. The ailing Doc Holiday is an interesting character to portray and Kilmer nails it. Along with Doc, Wyatt couldn't be just another law enforcer. He had to have a soft side and a mean streak as well. Russell give Wyatt a feeling of accomplishment, like he has done what he has set out to do. But when things go wrong, he is the first one you want on your side.

Fans of westerns, have no fear because Tombstone is hear! This magnificent film is worth more than one viewing and I'm sure you'll agree."
471,Courage Under Fire (1996),08-Mar-1996,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"['Drama', 'War']"," I like a movie that brings actor's or actresses out of their comfort zone and has them branch out. In this case TV comedian Bronson Pinchot and romantic comedy queen Meg Ryan. They each do a good job with their characters and hold their own. Denzel Washington I believe could have done a bit better but the story itself was a tough sell. Lou Diamond Phillips a all around actor I thought stood out and Matt Damon who went to extremes for the role was good. In all a complex story of should a woman be awarded the Medal Of Honour and be the first female recipient to do so. The Pentagon however wants this to happen but a investigation starts to prove otherwise if she was courageous under fire. As the story unfolds we see different perspective thoughts on what went down. Each time the story is told is different telling it as if she was a coward, too bossy or not of sole mind. Once we get to the guilt wrenched soldier for a second time do we see what really went down.

In all a interesting story that could have been better than it was. Still it's enjoyable and doesn't try that hard to be something else. We see a lot of struggle with Denzel Washington as Sterling who is battling with his own demons and investigating a MOH case that has it's ripples. The characters could have been more emotionally played out which Matt Damon does and outshines most the cast.

I liked it for what it was and not being a big war movie fan do say it's a better than average movie not really based on combat but it's aftermath. The ending leaves I think a question mark on the main character (Sterling) played by Washington in if he gets the help he needs to overcome his guilt. Again a enjoyable movie that'll keep you entertained."
472,Dragonheart (1996),31-May-1996,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Fantasy']"," My Take: Special effects are the driving force of this pedestrian, workmanlike Medieval adventure.

DRAGONHEART is a big budget, special effects-laden epic with some very neat CG the likes of those in JURASSIC PARK, perhaps even better. Thanks to CGI, the dragon here is no longer a clumsy puppet or a stop-motion animated character. The special effects creation here shows how fast special effects can progress over years and years of development. In terms of plot and characters, DRAGONHEART is only partial developed. The characters here lack more interest and the whole plot can't make it all good in the 103 min. running time.

Ironically, the most interesting character in the film isn't any of the human characters. It is the character of Draco, the CGI dragon which also features another great leap in special effects, it's voiced by Sean Connery. Given Connery's voice, the character is very interesting and screenplay gives him more interest than any of his human counterparts. His sparing with the human character Bowen (played by Dennis Quaid) is amusing, even if his counterpart isn't exactly as interesting as he is.

Other than Draco, the humans aren't very fancy. The hero, Bowen the dragon hunter, although played finely by Quaid (planting his tongue firmly in cheek), the script has not much to offer to him. The villain, played with a sly tongue by Brit David Thewlis, is practically an interesting character, but the script gives him less to do later. The great cast also includes Julie Christie, Jason Isaacs, Dina Meyer (from STARSHIP TROOPERS) and Pete Postlethwaite, all pretty good. The story didn't hold my attention for the entire running time. Perhaps its my lack of interest in the story that prevents it from getting into me.

DRAGONHEART isn't unwatchable, not to the very least, but I must say I didn't actually enjoy most of it. It has a number of fun scenes with Connery's voicing of Draco as well as some pretty neat action scenes, but it ain't perfection.

Rating: **1/2 out of 5."
473,James and the Giant Peach (1996),12-Apr-1996,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['Animation', ""Children's"", 'Musical']"," A young boy named James Henry Trotter (Paul Terry) is sent to live with his cruel and vindictive Aunts Sponge (Miriam Margolyes) and Spiker (Joanna Lumley) after James' parents are killed by a rhino. After saving a spider from being killed by his aunts, James is met by a magic man (Pete Postlethwaite) who gives James a bag of magical crocodile tongues that will make his dreams come true only to inadvertently trip and lose them. One of the tongues works its magic on a dead tree on Sponge and Spiker's property that ends up growing a peach to gargantuan size. Sponge and Spiker rake in massive admission fees from their exhibition of the peach, while James is still as miserable as ever. While cleaning up the trash around the peach James eats a piece of it which unbeknownst to him has a crocodile tongue in it and an opening in the peach reveals itself and inside are giant anthropomorphized bugs elegant and dignified Mr. Grasshopper (Simon Callow), abrasive, boastful, but ultimately good-hearted Brooklyn accented Mr. Centipede (Richard Dreyfus), sweet motherly Mrs. Ladybug (Jane Leeves), demure but strong Miss Spider (Susan Sarandon), neurotic and constantly panicked Mr. Earthworm (David Thewlis), and sweet, elderly, and slightly confused Mrs. Glowworm. Following a series of events that results in the peach rolling into the sea with James and the bugs inside it, the group head for New York City (as James' late father had promised him) meeting several surreal encounters along the way.

James and the Giant Peach is an adaptation the 1961 book of the same name by author Roald Dahl. Disney animator Joe Ranft had attempted to convince Disney staff to produce a film based on the book as far back as the early 80s as Ranft had been enamored with the book since reading it as a child. Disney refused due to the expensive animation process as well as the weird subject matter which was very ""dreamy"" and episodic. Disney eventually acquired the rights in 1992 from Dahl's widow Felicy and began developing the film. Dennis Potter of The Singing Detective and Pennies from Heaven wrote one of the early drafts but was ultimately rejected due to being too ""dark and bizarre"" with one sticking point being the shark attack episode having the sharks be Nazis. The final draft is attributed to Karey Kirkpatrick, Jonathan Roberts, and Steve Bloom. Henry Selick was brought on to direct, but there was debate on how to approach the material with Disney skeptical of the stop-motion process and whether the film should be entirely stop-motion. Eventually Selick opted for distinct live-action and stop-motion sequences abandoning the idea that James would be a live-action actor interacting with stop-motion elements (thought some parts do feature such an approach). Upon release, critical reception was positive with many complimenting the creativity of the visuals, characters, and animation, while the story and live-action elements were subject to some criticism. The movie was also an underperformer at the box office opening at number two behind Primal Fear and making $28 million against its $38 million budget, a step down from Nightmare Before Christmas' $50 million. The movie did eventually do better on home video and attained a cult audience that appreciated the weirdness on display, and while there's a lot to admire there's also issues in the storytelling and execution that keep you from being fully engaged.

To start off on a positive note, James and the Giant Peach has a unique look. In contrast to the twisted and dark iconography from Nightmare Before Christmas, James and the Giant Peach has its own visual identity with softer designs, brighter colors, and grander scope and it provides a unique experience separate from Selick's visions of Christmas and Halloween Town from Nightmare. The movie features a wide array of noted character actors providing the voices of the giant bugs and thanks to Selick's animation on the distinctive models as well as the actor's vocal delivery we get a good sense of who these characters are as well as their personalities. Paul Terry's does perfectly fine as James even if he's maybe a little uncertain in his performance, but since he's established as an audience proxy it works for the direction they take. The live-action sequences in the film were and still are slightly divisive and while I can understand why, for the style they go for I think it works. The sets are designed to look deliberately artificial looking but also timeless and there's an attempt to emulate the contrast of something like 1939's The Wizard of Oz, and while it doesn't quite work to that level, it's probably in the same messy but appealing section of something like 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T.

The writing in the film is probably the biggest issue as it's a very loosely structured narrative with a lot of surreal elements that don't have much internal logic even before James goes on his journey. One such element is the weird recurring motif of a rhino made of smoke and lightning that ""gobbled up his poor mother and father"" and what's supposed to be sad is just kind of left confusing because it's delivered in a blink of an eye with James' Parents gone within an absurdly short amount of time. The strangeness of James' Parents' death is so headscratching that it kind of makes the rest of the fantastical journey James takes on the peach with robotic sharks and undead pirates seem reserved by comparison. The movie is also a musical but unlike the songs from Nightmare Before Christmas, the soundtrack provided by Randy Newman just isn't on the same level with a lot of the songs feeling very similar to each other and never standing out. Randy Newman writes four songs that appear in the film (and one he sings over the credits) and the songs ""My Name is James"", ""That's the Life For Me"", ""Eating the Peach"", and ""Family"" just feel like they're here to extend the runtime rather than serve any narrative purpose as they're basically just dead stops in the already loose narrative that don't convey any character information nor sound all that memorable.

James and the Giant Peach has deservedly been recognized for its ambition and creativity, but it's also a slightly messy film with elements that don't come together like they should. While the movie's atmosphere, visuals, and characters have charm to spare, the writing struggles in giving substance to the dream-like episodic nature of the story. While the movie won't be to everyone's tastes it's too unique and strange of an experiment to deprive yourself of."

It's a classic, brilliant movie, one of the greatest British movies of all time, just as Lock stock did, it truly manages to capture, the feeling, spirit and very essence of a 90's Britain.

That opening sequence is awesome, so much energy, it really sets the tone for the film. At times it's fun and uplifting, and times it's downright bleak and harrowing, the baby scene is truly upsetting.

Renton is perhaps the central character, but Sick Boy will forever be my favourite, who will forget that tongue.

If you're considering taking drugs, or are close to slipping off the wagon, I'd recommend watching Trainspotting, there are some opinions out there that suggest the film glamorises drug taking, I'd argue the truth is far from it, you really do get to see the bleak side of drug taking.

The soundtrack is still awesome, you'll be downloading Born Slippy once the credits have rolled.

Awesome movie.

She is excellent in her part as Elise Elliot and isn't afraid of sending her own persona up. Her apartment is decorated everywhere with pictures of herself in glamorous positions, she drinks and smokes a lot and is constantly having cosmetic surgery but will only admit to that she has been ""freshened up"". But Midler and Keaton are also very good. Midler manages to deliver wise-cracks in her usual manner, but is still actress enough to display true sorrow about her failed marriage through facial expressions alone. Keaton, who has the slightest material to work with of the three, is actually the sweetest of the lot, and you do feel for her and understand her anger when her husband dumps her just after he's been sleeping with her. The supporting cast couldn't be bettered either. Maggie Smith should have been on screen more I think, her reactions towards Sarah Jessica Parker during dinner are priceless! Honorable mentions also goes to Hedaya, Berkley (who's coffee conversation with Hawn is a hoot!) and the before mentioned Parker. But the film, which starts in full gear, looses some steam towards the end. There should have been a twist or two in the ending. And some scenes to seem to be tacked on as an excuse for including others, for instance the girls talk about singing. But otherwise very entertaining and it is a joy to watch three outstanding actresses doing their stuff and apparently enjoying themselves immensely!"
477,Matilda (1996),02-Aug-1996,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[""Children's"", 'Comedy']"," Matilda is not without a certain charm, a charm that has you take to it come the death. You sense that children watching it will enjoy the way it depicts imperialistic grown ups implementing their rule upon young kids, of whom appear to think they know the way of the world, and then later failing to hold up said values as the tots, or singular 'tot', garner revenge and strives to put everything straight in the way they initially envisaged. There is enough to watch and get involved in, a Carrie-esque spin on what would normally be described as Disney does Kitchen Sink drama, as lowly people get in foggy circumstances and expressing their philistinism at any occasion they get - the Home Alone inspired finale does not do enough to extinguish what is a colourful comedy-drama about some rather delicate issues thrust through a tough blender.

True, the film is about a very young child getting their own way over certain adults; but when their respective 'own way' is as indelible and forward thinking as it is in Matilda, who's complaining about, or indeed accusing, the text of exuding disrespect towards superiors whilst neglecting authority? In the case of the Danny De Vito directed 1996 film Matilda, those adults are narcissistic parents and tyrannical head-teachers; head-teachers so stubborn that, in spite of the fact the film unfolds in America, make it so that the doors to their offices sport the very British ""Headmistress"" engraved on a plaque as opposed to the more American ""Principal"". Later on, we find out such a Headmistress, Mrs. Trunchbull (Ferris) even represented Great Britain at the 1972 Munich Olympics in the Shot Put discipline - one wonders if Team GB's true-to-life athlete from that year in that event ever got round to seeing De Vito's film, and if so, at all got a kick out it.

But we'll come to said headmistress. First and foremost, there is Matilda, who is deftly played by a certain Mara Wilson. Matilda is the daughter to Zinnia Wormwood (Perlman) and Harry Wormwood, played by Danny De Vito in a role thus seeing him contribute to the film in one of three capacities (the others being the narrator, who's incarnation is not linked to the body of the movie, and that of the aforementioned director). When we first witness her coming into contact with Harry and Zinnia on the day of her birth, we observe how different they both look in comparison to the other parents at the hospital whom are welcoming newborns; maybe it has something to do with the fact the Wormwoods' first born, Matilda's older brother Mikey (Levinson), arrived before her and had all of that attention and love parents lavish upon their babies, whereas those other newfound folks are here experiencing it for the first time. Whatever it is, and in spite of the fact it is no excuse at all, the fondness for childcare and such has long since evaporated from the Wormwoods as we witness Matlida develop through the stages of growth into an infant.

In this sense, she had to, because any other child would have died. Her father, Harry, is a short and stocky individual; a slimy and fast-talking businessman; an optimisation of greed, a man about as oily and greasy as the mechanical interiors to those second-hand cars he flogs to unsuspecting customers when many-a thing are wrong with them. Zinnia, her mother, is a stick-thin beauty obsessed vanity piece with a thick New York City accent and an enclosed mind to match; a woman too old to be dressing as loosely as she does and too ignorant to anything to notice everything that is wrong around her. What little joy she has with her parents during the early stages of her life occurs when she plays practical jokes on them; a scene at a restaurant after they've all gone out for dinner begins with a shot of a tray of cakes being wheeled out of the kitchen and around the bunched up tables ‚Äì then we realise Matilda's father has his hat stuck to his head on account of some super glue, and if we cannot anticipate the messy end to the scene involving said cakes, we just aren't trying hard enough.

It is whilst at school that the events which set in motion Matilda's change in life occur, only it is initially a school run by the aforementioned Agatha Trunchbull and it isn't so much a school as it is a prisoner of war camp - a place with high fences accompanied by barbed wire; a solitary confinement room as well as, and it'll probably upset others more than it did me, a large brick chimney on top of one of the more lower key structures in the compound which acts as a somewhat misplaced piece of concentration camp-like iconography. At school, she meets the wondrous Miss Honey who's played by actress Embeth Davidtz of whom, rather unfortunately in its keeping up to speed with the previous point, three years earlier starred in Schindler's List. Miss Honey is Matlida's teacher; a prim, slim and elegant person; an intelligent woman with a delicate look about her, someone is stark contrast to Trunchball's big blundering brute of an authoritarian ‚Äì where Miss Honey will waltz around her classroom clutching a flower by its stem implementing education, Trunchball will stomp around the playground wielding a riding crop instilling fear. The film is one of the more uplifting movies about human suffering, a piece with a nihilistic edge seemingly desperate to burst out but settling for something fantastical and rounded so as to not be too divorced from its audience. It's a very difficult film to hate, a very easy film to get into but a tough film to feel an awful lot more than indifferent about."

The choice of George Cukor as its director seems to have been made in heaven. Indeed, Mr. Cukor clearly understood what was needed to make this film the classic it became. George Cukor's contribution, as well of the magnificent screenplay, by Donald Ogden Stewart, make this a timeless comedy that looks as fresh today as when it was originally released.

It helps tremendously that Katherine Hepburn had played Tracy Lord on the stage and knew what made her tick. Ms. Hepburn, an actress of enormous talent, is the embodiment of this society woman. Katherine Hepburn clearly understood her character. Having come herself from a privileged family, she was able to get deep inside her character. Tracy Lord is going to be married to George Kitteredge, a man from her own social circle. Deep down inside, Tracy can't get her mind from the man she really loves, the rascal Dexler.

The casting of Cary Grant as C.K. Dexler was a touch of genius. Mr. Grant had played opposite Ms. Hepburn before. He was an actor that always delivered and was always a welcome addition to any of the movies of the period. Mr. Grant, with his good looks, makes the perfect man to play the part. As Dexler, the man who broke Tracy's heart, he returns just before the wedding, perhaps to remind her he's still loves her and can't get her out of his mind.

James Stewart was the other happy casting of ""The Philadelphia Story"". He was relatively unknown to the movie going public, but he left his mark all over the picture. As McCauley (Mike) Conner, this actor was perfect. As the tabloid reporter infiltrating the society wedding he proved his impeccable sense of timing.

Ruth Hussey, contributes to the film in unexpected ways. Virginia Weidler, as Dinah, is irresistible. The rest of the ensemble cast is a director's dream. Mary Nash, John Howard, Roland Young, John Halliday, Henry Daniel and the rest, are perfect.

""The Philadelphia Story"" will keep delighting audiences for many years to come."
479,Vertigo (1958),01-Jan-1958,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,"['Mystery', 'Thriller']"," John ""Scottie"" Ferguson (Jimmy Stewart, never better) is a retired detective with a severe fear of heights after a botched chase to capture a criminal. Due to his newly acquired acrophobia, he retires and wanders around the beautiful streets of San Francisco. Out of the blue, an old college friend Gavin Elster asks him to follow his wife Madeleine, as he believes that Madeleine may be possessed by the spirit of her great-grandmother, drifting in and out of reality and into trance-like states of mind. So Scottie agrees to follow the mysterious blonde (Kim Novak) as Hitchock guides us throughout San Francisco and into his strange and dark mind. Little by little, Scottie begins to become infatuated with Madeleine, and after he saves her from suicide (she jumped into San Francisco Bay) and decides to help her, he falls madly in love with her. In finding pieces of the puzzle to Madeleine's mystery, their journey takes them to the San Juan Bautista where Madeleine meets her end by tumbling off the bell tower, presumably by suicide. Scottie tried to save his love but his fear of heights stopped him. For the next year Scottie falls into a deep depression, feeling guilty for his impotency to save his love. His depression is halted when he sees Judy Barton (Novak again). Judy isn't like Madeleine--she's plain, in touch with reality and even vulgar when compared. But her face looks so much like Madeleine. Scottie begins to court Judy first for herself but eventually he tries to mold her into the beauty he lost prematurely, unaware that Judy has a big secret up her sleeve.

When it was first released, Vertigo didn't get good reviews and it didn't make money at the box office. People didn't understand the bizarre dream sequences that were so ahead of their time, they didn't feel sympathy for the characters (at the end, even Scottie is unlikable), and the BIG TWIST is given away in the middle of the movie instead of at the end, a la Psycho. Even I had my complaints about that last one, yet after a second viewing I realized that this movie wasn't even about what really happened to what really happened to Madeleine; it's about men's psychological--and sexual--desire for the perfect woman, even if she's out of touch with reality. This movie is considered Hitchcock's most personal film, as he could be domineering with his actresses, trying to mold them into his own dream. After the ""failure"" of Vertigo, Hitchcock never worked with Jimmy Stewart again, unfairly blaming him for not being able to draw a crowd on account of his age. Luckily for everyone, Vertigo has gotten better with age and is no longer forgotten. In the late 80s Vertigo started popping up on Top 10 Films of All Time lists, and today it's considered Hitchock's best film, and most definitely one of the best ever made.

The biggest reason for Vertigo's late success is because it is Hitchcock's most analyzed film and because it works on a psychological level; The film points out that men would rather have an unavailable, beautiful woman who is out of touch with reality than a woman who understands her surroundings and is utterly available. This is pointed out twice, once with Midge, an ex-fianc√©e and good friend of Scottie and later with Judy, who tries to make Scottie love her for who she is and not because she reminds Scottie of Madeleine. The first hour is drawn out very slowly, and while it's not as fast-paced as other Hitchcock's films, he uses it wisely. He starts by first gaining--later testing--our sympathy for Scottie; when he's hanging for his dear life in the opening scene, we pray for him (even though we know that there would be no movie if Jimmy Stewart dies in the first 3 minutes). When he's chasing Madeleine up the bell tower, we hope that he can get there in time and kiss his lover. And when the romance turns dark in the second outing to the bell tower, you feel just as caught in the middle as Scottie does in that moment. Hitchcock blurred the lines between victim and villain, and he earns our creative respect for him.

The key element to why Vertigo works so well in the end is because of the actors. It's practically impossible to think of anyone other than James Stewart, who embodied the everyman, and for that reason is so convincing in testing our sympathies. It's all in the minimalistic ways he does it, with the slightest crinkle in the forehead or the movement in the eyes doing evoking more emotion than most actors do screaming and crying. This is his best performance next to Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. And Kim Novak is ravishing and haunting both as Madeleine and Judy, utterly convincing in both roles. With my respects to Grace Kelly, Novak just may be the most mysterious and convincing Hitchcock blonde to grace the screen. Their chemistry together, despite their age difference is explosive and natural.

Buy--don't rent--this DVD and you'll find yourself falling for every detail of this brilliant film."
480,North by Northwest (1959),01-Jan-1959,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"['Comedy', 'Thriller']"," ""North By Northwest"" is another of Alfred Hitchcock's thrillers where an ordinary man is put into an extraordinary situation. As in most of these movies, the hero has to quickly adapt to his situation or perish.

This time it is Cary Grant who is thrust into a world of international intrigue when is mistaken by villain James Mason for an American operative named George Kaplan (the film's ""McGuffan"" by the way). Along the way he is seduced by Mason's mistress (Eva Marie Saint) while being pursued by Mason and his cronies from New York to Chicago to South Dakota and ultimately to Mount Rushmore for the film's climax.

""North By Northwest"" is full of classic Hitchcock moments. First,there is Grant's frustration and fear as he tries to explain to Mason that he is not the person they are seeking. Next, the scene in the cornfield where Grant is isolated and attacked by a plane is pure Hitchcock. Then we have the art auction where he cleverly escapes Mason's henchmen and finally, the finale at Mount Rushmore in a scene reminiscent of a similar one in ""Sabotage"" (1942) (which took place at the top of the Statue of Liberty).

The cast, as in most Hitchcock films is excellent. Grant is understandably confused and frightened as the the hero, Eva Marie Saint has never been sexier as the femme fatale, James Mason is suave and sinister as the villain and Martin Landau in an early role, is good as Mason's chief henchman. Hitchcock regular Leo G. Carroll is cold heartedly sinister as the ""professor"". Jesse Royce Landis as Grant's mother (she was about Grant's real age) is wasted and unnecessary to the plot.

The only problem that I have with this and other Hitchcock films is his over reliance on back projection and soundstage ""exteriors"". Other than that. ""North By Northwest"" has to be considered as one of Hitchcock's best. Watch for Hitchcock's hilarious cameo appearance at the end of the opening credits."

Curtis and Lemmon are like a mismatched couple, bickering and becoming frustrated with one another as they go through their misadventures on the road. It serves up some chuckles and humor and helps with the film's steady-moving plot. Marilyn Monroe as female lead Sugar Kane is surely the highlight of the movie and did what I think is one of her most iconic roles, bubbly, innocent-acting and vulnerable in her acting and singing two show-stopping songs. Her spellbinding beauty is sure to charm anyone and she had some good chemistry with Curtis.

However, the film does suffer a little from Curtis and Lemmon's at times overzealous acting and the lack of suspense from the pursing-mob subplot. Overall, though, it's not a bad film and is good for some laughs.

What turns a man into a legend? The man himself wasn't much: a slight build, not too tall, no Stallone muscles to swell his suit. What he had in classic films like `The Maltese Falcon' was a voice that cut through a script like a knife. `The Maltese Falcon,' directed by John Huston in 1941, reprised Dashiell Hammett's thriller. (It had been filmed before.) Hammett practically invented the tough guy so deep in cynicism nobody could hope to put anything past him. The novel, thick with plot, wasn't easy for director John Huston to untangle. Few people who cherish this film can summarize its story in a sentence or two. I'll try. San Francisco private eye Sam Spade (Bogart) is pulled into the search for a fabulously valuable statue by a woman who seeks his help. First, his partner is killed, then Spade pushes through her lies to uncover connections to an effete foreigner (Peter Lorre) and a mysterious kingpin (Sydney Greenstreet). The story unfolds like a crumpled paper. But the whodunit becomes less important than how we respond to the strong screen presence of Bogart and his co-stars. That's what makes `The Maltese Falcon' a classic. We see more and appreciate more each time we watch it. The art of Huston and Bogart doesn't come across until a second or third viewing. Huston invented what the French called film noir, in honor of Hollywood films (often `B' movies, cheap to make, second movies in double features) that took no-name stars into city streets to pit tough guys, often with a vulnerable streak, against dangerous dames. Audiences knew that when the tough guy said, `I'm wise to you, babe,' he'd be dead within a reel or two. Bogart was luckier than most noir heroes, but it cost. Struggling to maintain his own independence ¬ñ against the claims of love or his own penchant towards dishonesty ¬ñ the Bogart hero can do little better than surrender, with a rueful shrug, to the irony his survival depends on. The climax of `The Maltese Falcon' ranks with the last scene of `Casablanca,' another Bogart vehicle, in showing how the tough guy has to put himself back together after his emotions almost get the better of him. That assertion of strength, bowed but not broken, defines the enduring quality of Bogart on screen. For Huston, telling this story posed a different problem. Telling it straight wasn't possible ¬ñ too many twists. Huston chose to focus on characters. One way to appreciate Huston's choices is to LISTEN to the movie. Hear the voices. Notice how in long sequences narrating back story, Huston relies on the exotic accents of his characters to keep us interested. Could we endure the scene in which Greenstreet explains the history of the Maltese falcon unless his clipped, somewhat prissy English accent held our attention? Also, we watch Bogart slip into drug-induced sleep while Greenstreet drones on. Has any director thought of a better way to keep us interested during a long narrative interlude? And is there a bit of wit in our watching Bogart nod off during a scene which, if told straight, would make US doze? All of this leads to the ending, minutes of screen time in which more goes on, gesture by gesture, than a million words could summarize. He loves her, maybe, but he won't be a sucker. The cops come in, and the emotional color shifts to gray, the color of film noir heroes like Bogart. Bars on the elevator door as Brigid descends in police custody foreshadow her fate in the last image of Huston's film. But after the film, we're left with Spade, whom we like and loathe, a man whose sense of justice squares, just this once, with our own, maybe. Black and white morality prevails in a black and white movie, but Sam Spade remains gray ¬ñ and so does our response to this film classic."

This is why people feel so strongly about them, make them part of their lives, and love to talk about them. It reminds us of what is good about the movies and makes us long for a time when you can have this kind of talent, both in front of and behind the camera, make wonderful,touching, hilarious films.

""Sabrina"" may not be the best film that Wilder, Bogart, Holden, or Hepburn made, but it came along at a time when all four of them were going through the best part of their careers.

Holden was not too far removed from winning the Oscar for ""Stalag 17"" and was about to enter a ""golden"" period, starting with ""The Country Girl"" and continuing on until ""Bridge on the River Kwai. Bogart ( a last minute replacement for Cary Grant), had just completed ""The Caine Mutiny"". Hepburn had just won the Oscar for ""Roman Holiday"", and Wilder had ""Stalag 17"" and ""Sunset Boulevard"" completed, and would have a string of hits that started with ""Sabrina"" and continue on until ""One, Two, Three"" in 1961.

All of the stars were properly aligned for ""Sabrina"". Although I think Grant might have been better in the part, Bogart worked hard to be semi-tough and likable. I'll be honest and say I found it disturbing to see him try to win over Hepburn. His features were too worn and hard to be completely winning. He and Holden worked well together, which is amazing when you consider they couldn't stand each other off screen.

Hepburn, of course, is gorgeous. She's the perfect combination of charming, elegant, tom-boyishness, and beauty.

Wilder does it again with his screenplay and directing. First he assembles an excellent supporting cast, especially Walter Hampden and John Williams. Then he keeps the comedy coming and seldom lets up for us to catch our breath. His use of the camera is terrific too. I love the shot of Bogart at his desk in the distance, while the camera shoots through several doorways.

Top notch production, first rate cast and wonderful screenplay and directing add up to a classic every movie lover should own.

One can hardly believe it's the same crowded metropolis that it is today. Let's hear it for 1953! The other recent film that shows Rome so beautifully is ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"". (2) As usual, Audrey Hepburn is just wonderful. She came from some beautiful planet. The scene when she wakes up in Gregory Peck's apartment is lovely: I just think of how she tries to cover herself with the blanket and misses covering her posterior. Just great. The scene at the ""Mouth of Truth"" is fantastic.

Second, the bad stuff. (1) Gregory Peck just does not fit Audrey Hepburn. He lacks her light touch. He is a bit wooden --- just like Humphrey Bogart in Sabrina. I thought that Gary Cooper was a better romantic lead in ""Love in the Afternoon"". (2) I am always uncomfortable when Italian characters are portrayed as a type of buffoon. (3) A princess on the lam is a great idea, but monarchy as a real institution, as portrayed in this movie, has very little meaning anymore. I realize that Queen Elizabeth was crowned a couple of years before this movie was made, and the pomp, mystique, and the royal ethic of self-subordination were probably still very much alive. But now all that is quite tarnished for whatever reason. Princess Ann's transformation and maturation therefore seem artificial and dated.

What can I say? As a Hepburn film, it's a 10. As a movie, it's a 5 or 6."

On the form, there is not much to say, it is your typical Billy Wilder movie with a perfect mise-en-sc√®ne and photography (very good work on lighting).

There is however a lot of criticisms to make about the content because even though the movie tackles quite effectively, with a cutting look, the Hollywood scene, its fallen stars and aspiring artists, the plot is horrendously unimpressive and extremely shallow.

This pseudo romance between William Holden whose role is too bland, too unidimensional, and Gloria Swanson who overacts from start to finish, never captivates the viewer because this story lacks coherence and cohesion, not to mention the movie sometimes looks like a thriller, sometimes like a drama, sometimes a romance, it mixes up too much genres without really developing any of them which ultimately serves it badly."

It stars Cary Grant as Devlin, an FBI agent, and Ingrid Bergman as Alicia Huberman. Huberman's father has been convicted of treason against the U.S., because of his postwar Nazi activities. Bergman is drinking her life away among friends who are drinking their lives away.

Grant recruits her to join him in South America and seduce the Nazi leader there--Alexander Sebastian, played by Claude Rains. How can a movie miss when it stars Bergman, Grant, and Rains?

The plot is Hitchcockian, and not very subtle, but who can resist star power like that? Some of the scenes make us groan 70 years later. Bergman is a ""loose woman,"" so it's OK for her to marry Rains in order to help the FBI. Everyone smokes. Evil people look evil, and good people look good. Actually, that's an asset. Leopoldine Konstantin as Rain's mother, Mme. Sebastian, looks very evil and she acts even more evil than that. She only has a supporting role, but it's what she does with that role that counts.

We saw this film at the excellent Dryden Theatre at the George Eastman Museum, in Rochester NY. It was great to see it on the large screen, but it will work almost as well on a small screen.

This storyline is absolutely brilliant in terms of being a creative ""who done it"" picture while also being a fascinating character piece. The cinematography in this film was way ahead of its time starting with the very first scene. The lifestyles were fascinating and well delivered and the acting, writing and dialogue is out of this world. Kelly vs the French teen in this was hilarious and Grant is suave and unpredictably fluid. The plot unfolds at the perfect pace and the rooftop climax is legendary.

This is a magnificent film that is a Hitchcock masterpiece. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it."

With his wicked ways he oppresses the people, boosts taxes, hangs those who refuses to pay them and generally rules with an iron fist. Out of this situation a hero arises, Sir Robin of Locksley, who forms a band of outlaws to disrupt the actions of Prince John's men and steal the money back that they have stolen from the citizens of the land. However with Guy of Gisbourne and the Sheriff of Nottingham, Prince John makes plans to capture Robin and make an example out of him ¬ñ but they've got to find him first!

This film often sits high on many critics' lists along side many films that would be considered worthy because they would be called 'art' or generally be classic films in the traditional sense; indeed this film also sits high on the top 250 list on this site ¬ñ and long may it continue to do so! Although this film is hardly the sort of stuff that the high-brow critic would pick in his top 100 list, the fact that it usually appears there says a lot for just how good it is ¬ñ not as a classic and deep piece of art but as a really enjoyable adventure film. We all know the basic story and the film sticks to it well ¬ñ although to be honest I can never remember if I know it from this film or from the legend itself! The plot is engaging but it is the manner of delivery that makes this film so much fun to watch.

The action is hardly groundbreaking (how could it be after 60+ years?) but given that it isn't based on effects, it has stood up really well and is enjoyable to watch ¬ñ it's an overused term but the action here is what I would define as 'swashbuckling' fun! For my money the even better aspect of the film is that it manages to take this vein of good clean fun and run it through the entire film. Most enjoyably for me was the dialogue that was often laugh out loud funny ¬ñ some lines were hardly of the period but were funny none the less! Outside of the comedy in the dialogue, the film manages to retain the sense of fun in all but the odd darker scene. This sense of fun is passed through (and sustained by) the performances, which are led by a typically cocksure (pardon the pun) Errol Flynn. He plays Robin larger than life, and rightly so. He is tremendous fun in the lead and he is major part of making sure it all comes off. Rains has a minor role but he is not a straight bad guy and has a strange humour about it ¬ñ he may not have the ham that Alan Rickman would later bring to the role but he does it very well nonetheless. Playing a more traditional bad guy was Basil Rathbone ¬ñ a good actor and made all the more enjoyable performance for me because I rarely see him in anything but the Holmes movies. De Havilland is pretty but doesn't make much of an impression as Marion but luckily Robin's merry men are roundly good with fun performances from Pallette, Hale, Knowles and others.

Overall this is a great film ¬ñ not because the story is really deep or the special effects are astounding but simply because it is a really fun (and funny) swashbuckling adventure. With a real sense of fun running though the script, the cinematography (and wondrous Technicolor), the dialogue and the performances this film has stood up effortlessly over the past 60+ years and it will continue to do for long after my generation are dead and buried and other ones come to discover it."
492,East of Eden (1955),01-Jan-1955,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," James Dean made only three films before his untimely death in 1955. EAST OF EDEN is the only one I hadn't seen and the second of the three to be shown on Reel 13. I was particularly curious about EAST OF EDEN because it paired Dean with one of his Actors' Studio mentors ¬ñ director Elia Kazan. Kazan introduced the more naturalistic ""method"" acting style to Hollywood with films like A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE and ON THE WATERFRONT. The impact of the collaboration is most apparent in that Dean, for the only time in his brief career, seems to be surrounded by actors with a similar background and training. In the review of REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE, I noted how it often seemed that Dean was acting in his own movie, but here, he is amongst peers in Julie Harris, Burl Ives, Lois Smith and Jo Van Fleet, who won an Oscar for her supporting performance (I am usually against giving Oscars to people for less than ten minutes of screen time, but I might have to make an exception here ¬ñ she was brilliant).

Oddly enough, with all the familiar and talented thespians around him, Dean's presence is less effective than it was in his other work. Don't get me wrong ¬ñ he displays several moments of greatness (great body language throughout, outstanding choices in the Ferris wheel scene), but as blasphemous as it might be to say, there were a few moments where I felt he went too far. He is constantly whining to such an extreme degree, that it diffuses the moments that really call for it. Now, this isn't overacting in the traditional sense. As a matter of fact, I feel similarly about this performance as I did about the recent performance by Daniel Day-Lewis in THERE WILL BE BLOOD. It's more scenery chewing than overacting. Both actors are believable when they hit those extreme emotions, but I wonder if the choice to go that far is always appropriate. While it's impressive that they can get there, they might be actually be harming the overall narrative. The more often they cry or scream, the less impact it will have as the film goes on. This is problematic because, more often than not, the end of a film requires the broader emotions more than the beginning. For example, there is a scene toward the end of EAST OF EDEN where Dean's character presents his father with a gift that he worked his ass off for, but the righteous father manages to find the negativity in it. Dean cries and convulses in full breakdown mode, almost as if he didn't have control of his motor skills. This had the potential to be very powerful ¬ñ if we hadn't seen it four times earlier. To be fair, this was Dean's first film and he clearly went on to refine his craft in his next efforts.

Elia Kazan also seemed a little off his game. This film, which was possibly his most ambitious in terms of scope and budget seems more like an experiment to him than anything else. I got the sense that he was almost playing with ideas and concepts. He employs these very interesting Dutch angles throughout, but very often, they don't seem to be motivated. There is an early Q&A scene between Dean and Raymond Massey. As the scene goes on, the angle becomes more off-axis, but the scene occurs too early to utilize a technique that extreme. (There is a scene later on the film when Dean is on a swing where Kazan justifies the awkward angle by using the forward movement of the swing to essentially ""push"" the camera off-axis. This works much better). Other experiments were more successful. First, this might have been the first time he shot in color and the results are astounding. The cinematography is beautiful and the colors are extraordinarily rich. Second, he is a master of staging and not in the theatrical sense. This is very much blocking for the camera frame. The best example is the scene that takes place immediately after the scene where Dean presents the gift. Dean pouts in the backyard under a huge tree. Its leaves hang so low that they obscure the entire top half of Dean. Julie Harris runs under the tree to console him so she is also hidden. (This idea of obscuring characters/moments from the camera occurs often in the Kazan oeuvre). From their legs and torso, you can tell they stand close, but is he crying on her shoulder? Are they making out? Then, Dean's brother comes out and orders Harris (his girlfriend) out from the tree. She runs out and into the foreground. The brother is in the middleground with his back to the camera and Dean is in the background, still obscured by the tree. The brother then begins to admonish Dean's character, but it's Harris' face we see ¬ñ as if the brother could be referring to either one of them. It's a beautiful, simple and truly cinematic framing idea that manages to convey a multitude of ideas with one swift stroke.

As you may have interpreted, I have mixed feelings about EAST OF EDEN. While the artistic achievements of the film are exciting, the film ultimately fails to pack an emotional punch, possibly because the narrative is mired in the complexities and the allegories of the Steinbeck novel it's based on. Familial relations, foreign politics, xenophobia, profiteering, infidelity, class distinctions, the nature of evil and of course, the albatross hanging over the whole thing ¬ñ Biblical allegory ¬ñ are all covered within the 110 minutes of EAST OF EDEN. While I think it's great that Kazan tried to layer the film with all that meaning, I wonder if he didn't push it too far. With all those deep issues crammed into one package, it's hard to care about any of them."
493,"Thin Man, The (1934)",01-Jan-1934,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,['Mystery']," What a pleasant surprise! Settling myself down to watch 'The Thin Man,' W.S. Van Dyke's highly-suspenseful, hard-boiled detective film, based on Dashiell Hammett's mystery novel of the same name, I had no idea that the film would be a remarkably well-written comedy, with the murders themselves taking second tier to the witty banter of Nick and Nora Charles (William Powell and Myrna Loy). Hilariously scripted, with flawless acting from all involved, 'The Thin Man' is one of the most refreshingly funny films I have seen in a very, very long time.

Nick is a retired detective, but he is purported to have been one of the best. Nowadays, he is quite content to sit back, help himself to another martini and pay little mind to the mysteries that may pass his way. When we first sight Nick, he has his back turned to the camera, and he is teaching the bartenders how to properly prepare a martini: ""The important thing is the rhythm. Always have rhythm in your shaking. Now a Manhattan you shake to fox-trot time, a Bronx to two-step time, a dry martini you always shake to waltz time.""

Nora, who can match wits with her husband at any time, is Nick's playful and exuberant wife, always itching for a little mystery and intrigue. The two have the sort of chemistry that we all hope for in a marriage, and is always the most fun to watch on screen. They have a playful understanding with each other; there is no obligatory family discord in this marriage, nor are there any secrets or mistresses (these evils are saved for the less ""perfect"" relationships in the film). Husband and wife take any chance they can to good-naturedly disparage each other and prove their own superiority, and, by the end of the film, they are about at level pegging. Walking into a bar on one occasion, Nora demands to know how many martinis her husband has already consumed. She immediately orders five more to be even with him!

The mystery itself is a bit of a muddle, but if you think too hard about it you'll miss all the clever repartee between our two detective spouses. When secretive inventor Clyde Wynant (Edward Ellis, who is the ""Thin Man"" referenced in the title, though most audiences and critics ostensibly referred to Powell's character as such) goes missing, and his former lover (Natalie Moorhead) is found dead, Wynant is considered the prime suspect. Eventually returning from retirement to clear his friend's name, Nick and an enthusiastic Nora enter a web of deceit, lies and betrayal to find the real murderer. Among the possible suspects are Wynant's ex-wife, Mimi (Minna Gombell), Mimi's new partner, Chris (Cesar Romero), a petty thief, Joe Morelli (Edward Brophy) and a shifty criminal, Arthur Nunheim (Harold Huber). Having finally come to a conclusion about who the murderer is, Nick invites all the prime suspects to a dinner party at his place, announcing to everyone at the beginning of the meal, ""the murderer is right in this room. Sitting at this table! (and then to the waiter) You may serve the fish.""

'The Thin Man' was nominated for four Oscars at the 1935 Academy Awards (Picture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, Actor (Powell)), and spawned a respectable five sequels, a 1957 television series and a radio play. It also made a star of Skippy (later renamed Asta), the Wire-Haired Fox Terrier who accompanies the Charles' on several of their clue-finding missions. In terms of pure entertainment value, films do not get much better than this."

This movie is, without a doubt, the best of all time.

""It's a Wonderful Life"" is a movie that you can watch over and over again. It's movie that makes you think, about life in general and how each person makes a difference, and about how great life can be (hence the title ""It's a Wonderful Life). Whilst making you think, it also entertains with many light hearted moments, particularly towards the end of the film.

The direction, sound and casting in ""It's a Wonderful Life"" are second to none. Yet it is the fact that almost any person can watch this movie and come away feeling inspired that makes it easily the best movie of all time!

497,Bringing Up Baby (1938),01-Jan-1938,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Comedy']," Film Review ‚Äì Bringing Up Baby

Howard Hawk's screwball comedy, Bringing Up Baby (1938), that entails a series of misunderstandings occurring one after the other between a polite paleontologist, a gorgeous clumsy woman and a leopard named Baby. After their run in at a golf course, Susan (Katharine Hepburn) convinces David (Cary Grant) to help take care of her auntie's pet leopard, as she believes David is a zoologist rather than a paleontologist. A series of comical errors ensue throughout the film played out by excellent overall performances by the entire cast.

The plot was at times very frustrating to follow, due to the absurd misunderstandings that consist of stupidity too hard to believe. This is most prominent towards the end when somehow everyone involved ends up in trouble with the police. However, aside from that, the film is a joy to watch for the brilliant acting and screen presence of Cary Grant and for the wonderful comic timing by Katharine Hepburn. Hepburn and Grant share great on-screen chemistry which at first seems to elicit the dynamic of a brother/sister friendship. Though as the film progresses, their bizarre relationship unfolds into quite an unlikely romance that didn't seem entirely convincing.

In many scenes, Hawks and the editor, George Hively, deliberately showed long durations between cuts, eliciting a dynamic that resonates with an on-stage play. This decision was cleverly made to accentuate the acting skills of the cast members, particularly Hepburn and Grant. The camera lets the comedy unfold through their performances without interruption. This technique allows them the freedom that two great actors require to get the best out of their talents. It is a technique that has since been used throughout cinema for decades.

Bringing Up Baby is a classical film that consists of good writing, great comic performances and many laughs along the way."

It's a likable classic film because of those two famous actors, a nice romance, good adventure and even some comedy thrown in to the mix. I'm shocked a well-known film with these actors still isn't available on DVD in Region 1, as of late 2006.

The two actors squabble in the beginning but I like the fact that the film didn't go on too long in that regard as they did in many old-time battle-of-the-sexes movies. The story also a little unusual in that neither lead actor is in his/her prime, meaning it's almost a middle-age romance story.

Once they become enamored with each other, the movie mainly goes into the trials the two have in piloting this boat, ""The African Queen"" down river with the goal of reaching a German ship and blowing it up. Yes, it's a World War II movie, of sorts.

To be honest, the film does slow down a bit in the beginning of Bogie and Hepburn's romance but the last 30 minutes finish strong with one obstacle after another hitting the pair of adventurers, and it's interesting to watch."

The film is not the play, but you don't often get an opportunity to see a fine cast perform this amazing play, and it needs a fine cast.

The movie has a fine cast. The movie grips you from start to finish. The movie even adds a little; the basement scene works wonderfully in the movie in ways that would be hard or impossible to reproduce on stage.

Yes, the play has been bowdlerised to make it into a movie, but what do you expect in 1958. The reality is, this film is a piece of cinema and drama history. You'd need to be a ""Williams Fundamentalist"" to hate the movie for its toned-down-ness. To the balanced Williams fan, it is gripping, well acted and nicely-paced.

Once every 10-15 years there is a truly fine production of this play in a world-class theatre. If you get the chance, go see a great production in the theatre. In between times, this movie is a very good second."

Dumbo is an elephant born with big ears, but who cares? True beauty comes from within. Dumbo's mother was like Bambi's mother, wise and memorable, and like Dumbo, misunderstood. The song ""Baby of Mine"" is so sad, that I always cry when I see this film because of it, Casey Jnr is very rousing and having a good laugh during ""Seen an Elephant Fly"". In regard to the crows, I saw nothing racist about them, they are stereotypical yes in a sense but in a positive way. Timothy the mouse is also memorable, a bit like Dumbo's conscience in a sense. For me, the highlight was Dumbo's dream, with the elephants dancing(a bit unrealistic but very imaginative), with ballet-like incidental music towards the end. I found the song ""Elephants on Parade"" catchy and I love how trippy the whole sequence is. In conclusion, I rejoiced when Dumbo conquered his fears, when it looked impossible. Great idea, Disney, about the flying elephant, although Don Bluth used a similar idea 50 years later for Pebble and the Penguin. A beautiful film, 10/10 Bethany Cox"

In New York, the products tester Fielding Mellish (Woody Allen) meets the political activist Nancy (Louise Lasser) and they have a love affair. Fielding has an unrequited love with Nancy, who believes that he is immature and without leadership.

Fielding decides to travel to San Marcos and General Vargas plots a scheme the assassination of Fielding to be supported by the USA against the rebels led by Esposito (Jacobo Morales). However the rebels save Fielding and train him in guerrilla warfare. General Vargas flees to the United States. Esposito deranges with the power and Fielding becomes the President of San Marcos. He wears a long beard and travels to USA seeking financial support to the country and he meets Nancy again, who falls in love with him.

""Bananas"" is a witty joke with the US- sponsored dictatorships in Latin America in the 60's by Woody Allen. The story has hilarious situations, like when Fielding Mellish is buying the porn magazine ""Orgasm""; or with the two subway thugs (one of them the uncredited Sylvester Stallone); or having dinner with the junta; or training with the rebels. My vote is eight.

503,"Candidate, The (1972)",01-Jan-1972,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," I like Robert Redford quite a bit as an actor. I especially like him in anything political. His run for senate as a nobody has the makings for a great movie. Great, it wasn't.

I found it entertaining, however, it seemed slow and at times boring. In fact, I wasn't impressed with Redford as much as usual. Most of the rest of the cast was just filler.

One problem I had was that the movie fails to explain in any meaningful way how Redford continues to close the gap to his opponent. Surely good looks isn't going to get you from 32% to over 50%.

Overall, I wouldn't even waste a minute on this movie, but any political movie with Redford as a star has got a big advantage up front. You default to liking it and you only change your mind if there are serious problems. There weren't any serious problems, but I have seen Redford in many better movies - Sneakers, The Natural, All the President's Men, Three Days of the Condor and The Sting, for example."

Artur Penn's based on a true story classic of violence, sexuality, and crime, was excellent thirty-two years ago when it first came out, is excellent today, and will be excellent for decades to come. Plus, it is one of those rare movies that are at the same time a landmark for cinema history as well as a true classic for more than just its landmark aspect. This movie earned five nominations only for acting and won best supporting-actress for Estelle Parsons.

One morning, as she wakes up, Bonnie Parker (Faye Dunaway) notices that a man is trying to subtly break into her car. She quickly dresses up and runs down. The man looks up at her embarrassed and we are than revealed Clyde Barrow (Warren Beatty). The two of them go for a walk down the road but when Clyde tells Bonnie that he is a robber, she doesn't believe him. So, he decides to prove to her that he isn't lying and robs a small grocery shop right away. As soon as he exits the store, he shows Bonnie the money and they escape in a car that they steal. And so begins an adventure they will never forget.

Along their way, they pick up a young boy who works at a gas station who is called C.W. (Michael J. Pollard). They begin doing more and more robberies until Clyde is finally forced to kill someone. Later on in their trip, Clyde's brother (Gene Hackman) and his wife Blanche (Estelle Parsons) catch up with Clyde, C.W., and Bonnie and they continue committing crimes such as robberies and even sometimes murders but usually in cases of self-defense.

""Bonnie and Clyde"" is beautifully acted and expertly directed. After ""Bonnie and Clyde"", Arthur Penn directed some other good movies such as ""Little big man"" but as good as they were all, none ever equalled ""Bonnie and Clyde"". If you haven't seen it yet, you should put it first on your ""Next movies to watch"" list."

I am most disappointed by the lack of depth in the Grace Kelly and Cummings characters, which are both one-note uninteresting roles. Grace Kelly is wasted in a passive, weak, and vapid role which relegates her to the status of window dressing (not that there is anything wrong with that!), she might as well be a nice looking piece of furniture in this movie. The Cummings role is wasted as the passion between him and Kelly is not developed, and amazingly, the tension that would exist between Milland and Cummings is never apparent!. This guy was sleeping with Milland's wife, but you would think they were best friends. What a waste. Would have been a lot more interesting if Kelly and Cummings were not such bland, cardboard harmless people and were a little more human, with real emotions (jealousy, hatred, passion, even a little evil).

Milland makes the move interesting to watch as he sets his plan in motion with great charm and flair. Unfortunately, as he is the only interesting character, you kind of feel bad when he is caught in the end and the two sappy characters prevail. Oh well, it could have been a lot more 'noir' if they had not glossed over the fact that Kelly and Cummings are far from the sweet innocents they are portrayed."

In ""A Streetcar Named Desire"", Blanche travels from her antebellum roots in Mississippi to New Orleans, to see her sister Stella. But, upon arriving in the Big Easy, Blanche must confront Stella's husband Stanley, a greasy, poker-playing neanderthal lout who knows a thing or two about reality. It's the clash between Blanche's stately delusions and Stanley's gritty realism that soups up the drama in this Tennessee Williams play, converted to film classic by director Elia Kazan.

The drama is absorbing. But the performances of Marlon Brando and Vivien Leigh, as Stanley and Blanche, are what make the film the cinematic powerhouse that it is. Excellent B&W lighting and jazzy background music amplify the seedy, sleazy atmosphere, which adds depth and texture to the story and the acting. And, of course, the claustrophobic, steamy French Quarter makes a perfect setting.

As one would expect for a film derived from a play, ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" is very talky. Generally, I don't care for films burdened with a ten thousand page script. But this talk-fest is an exception. Overwhelming what I would otherwise consider a weakness, the acting of Brando and Leigh alone are enough to justify a two hour investment, and render an enjoyable and memorable cinematic experience."

I completely support Jimmy and Larry for standing up for their rights and for what they believe in. I don't know Larry, but I find Jimmy to be very much like his character in the movie. It was fun seeing the movie ""after"" I had become friends with Jimmy. He's a wonderful man, very kind, and very down to earth.

To be honest this is actors movie because every other element is averaged between normal to weak everything was used to parade Daniel day-lewis performance and I respect this choice because he deserves it and there were supporting characters with great performance and arc

I have to say that I haven't seen the original movies that this is a remake of so I didn't have that to compare it to, therefore if I compare it to something, I compare it to other movies I have seen.

Because the movie has a lot of things I have already seen in other movies (I won't say what because that may be considered spoiling the movie). Therefore the story isn't what makes this movie and if you're looking for a great story, the movie might not be for you.

What the movie does have first of all is a great cast that delivers. Denzel Washington gives the best performance of the movie by far but also Chris Pratt shows that Guardians wasn't a fluke, Hawke, D'Onofrio and just the entire cast works very well together for this nice team of 7 misfits that has to save the town.

Also the action is great, it's very true to the old westerns. There are some very tense stand-offs and when the shooting starts, the action is fantastically shot, directed and just well executed.

And the movie has a good sense of humor, there are good comedic moments that give good levity to the movie.

Because the movie actually is pretty towards an R-rated movie, it has some harsh and brutal things happening that might not be for kids. It's one of the most mature PG-13 movies I have seen.

All in all, the Magnificent Seven is a fun time in the theater, probably not as good as the original but better than most remakes these days (looking at you Ghostbusters) and I give it an 8.5/10"

But there's nothing here which will try to appeal to your immediate senses. This is a poignantly beautiful metaphysical excursion on what it means to be human. Wim Wenders has recognized the metaphysical nature of the movie by dedicating it to Truffaut, Ozu and especially Tarkovskij. And everything -- the bleakness of the landscape, the ubiquity of the Berlin wall, the anguish in which the characters are immersed -- acquires a deeper meaning when we see it through the eyes of two angels. And the sky over Berlin, with its angels, is the only thing that keeps together two painfully divided sides of the city, and the only perspective from which to see it as one.

But handle with care: if you're looking for a movie with an enthralling plot, a clear language and a reasonable pace, you'll be disappointed. The first time I saw this movie with a friend we laughed all the way. I've seen it more 5-6 times now and I've stopped laughing. I sit there and I'm mesmerized.

The movie was born without a script and it is a melting pot with dialogues by Peter Handke, improvised monologues by the actors, connecting material written by Wim Wenders. In one example, Wenders indulges too long in a scene just because he regrets removing it due to all the work the actress has made for preparing to be a trapezist. This is clearly against all rules and all common sense.

Despite all this the movie works and the reason is, the movie somehow manages to touch deep strings all the way through, because of its beautiful imagery (thanks to director of photography Henri Alekan), its eerie soundtrack, the disorderly collection of truly poetic dialogues/monologues, very inspired acting, and the impredictable combined effect of all this -- surely beyond what was planned by Wim Wenders himself. Should I add that the movie has created its own language for making its point?

The film has also become an incredible documentary on Berlin just before the fall of the wall."

Joseph Cotten plays cheap novelette author Holly Martins, just arrived in Vienna to meet with long-time friend Harry Lime, who offered him a job. He instead meets with the mysterious facts surrounding the death of Lime, learned bit-by-bit from Lime's friends, a woman named Anna Schmidt, who has problems of her own (played excellently by Valli), and two British officers, Calloway and Paine. Learning, that there is more to death of Lime than there seems to be, Martins begins his investigation for the truth. This film was shot with some of the greatest, most ahead-of-its-time cinematography ever, and it creates mystery and deceit. It is complimented by the excellent use of shadows. The soundtrack is essentially one long song, which plays throughout the film, changing and stopping as the emotion calls for. It is a zither composition by Anton Karas made for the film. This is all topped off by an engrossing storyline, and a great performance by Joseph Cotten, as the ordinary man mixed up in this web of mystery."

Near Christmas, they plan to return to La Rochelle; but out of the blue, Captain Henrich receives an order to cross the Strait of Gibraltar to go to Italy. But the captain knows how protected the area is and plans a means to lure the British Navy. Will the U-96 succeed in crossing the Strait of Gibraltar?

""Das Boot"" is a German masterpiece by Wolfgang Petersen with 2h 29 min. The ""Superbit"" director's cut on DVD with one additional hour is a supreme masterpiece of a war (or anti-war) film. It is impressive how a 3h 29 min film is never boring, keeping the viewer on the edge of his or her seat until the very ending. The claustrophobic and tense story increases the drama and the character development in this version, becoming one of the best movies in the cinema history. The German captain, officers and crew are not shown as one-dimension character or sad killing machine like in many war films, but as human beings with families and friends, very efficient in their works but with fear and other feelings. My vote is ten.

516,Local Hero (1983),01-Jan-1983,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Comedy']," Local Hero is a slice of Scottish whimsy with a touch of magical realism. It has a stirring soundtrack by Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits.

American oil tycoon and keen astronomer Felix Happer (Burt Lancaster) wants to buy an entire Scottish fishing village in Ferness Bay so he can build an oil refinery.

Mac (Peter Riegert) is sent over to negotiate the deal with the villagers because he has a Scots sounding name.

When he arrives, Mac liaises with a local rep Danny (Peter Capaldi.) Both meet Marina (Jenny Seagrove) who is a marine biologist working for the Scottish branch of the oil company. She thinks that the company are going to build a marine sanctuary.

The locals are happy to sell as they eye riches and the chance to leave their hard life. To them Mac is the local hero who will give them lots of cash.

Gordon Urquhart (Denis Lawson) is the local accountant, hotelier and village taxi driver who is handling the negotiations on behalf of the villagers. The more time Mac spends in the village, the more he gets to like to pace of life and wonderful night sky such as the Northern lights.

Mac is later told that an old man who lives in a hut on the beach, Ben Knox (Fulton Mackay) actually owns the beach that is important to the deal. It leads Happer to come to Scotland to negotiate personally with Ben.

Director Bill Forsyth has gone for a small scale charming film. It has some surrealism. Is Marina actually a mermaid as she managed to swim to Ferness Bay and she has webbed feet. Also, who is the father of that crying baby.

It is a world where a corporation boss is not evil but just eccentric. Happer is harassed by his own therapist. Mac wants to trade in his Porsche and live a simple life in the village knowing he has come to destroy it and its way of life.

The weak link is actually Reigert. This was a big leap for him and he is rather bland compared to the Scottish actors and of course Burt Lancaster. The one who steals the movie is Fulton Mackay. I still remember the line after all these years, his offer to sale for the grains of sand he holds in his hand."

the introduction of Manhattan in the early scene, the long walk of two friends after dinner, wide roads of the city, woody's apartment, Murphy's phone conversation, all shout out the brilliant use of CS. woody very smartly squeezes the frame by placing something in the foreground, or keeping the actors in a closer frame as and when required.

overall it gives us an expression of vastness of city and makes a exuberant locale for the characters to play their part. gordon willis' ligting also helps in making the picture look life-like and get the feel of manhattan(check out the use of no light,blackout) well to say the least i have never seen manhattan (with my own eyes) but because of such a detailed work i have a glimpse of it.

518,Miller's Crossing (1990),01-Jan-1990,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," Tom Reagan, the main character in this film, frequently states that you cannot know a person well, and both much of the appeal, and the weakness of this film lie in just this approach to characterization. The film has an intricate plot, and many people will find that characteristic very appealing, but the many intricate plot twists and character decisions somehow do not seem to spring naturally from either the characters or events on screen.

This disconnect is an odd thing to see, because any, or at least most, individual scenes from the film are more or less viable and reasonable in and of themselves, but taken as a whole, you can see the puppet strings of the movie yanking the characters this way and that to achieve complexity and surprise. Because of this, while much of the acting is good, it feels false in context, with scenes failing to synchronize with one another, and with the only realistic characters, considering an individual performance as a whole, being the simple and somewhat stereotypical ones. If you are sensitive to this disconnect, you may well dislike the movie, but if you are instead, longing for a complex plot, you may love it.

I should note that as usual in a Coen brothers film, the dialog is a treat, but cannot fail to mention that unlike their better known work, you are likely to miss a good deal of it, as the sound quality is not high enough to decipher many a clever comment.

All considered, the easiest way of looking at this film is to see it as an early effort, pointing to future greatness perhaps, but not a complete and developed masterpiece."

Certainly a consuming piece of cinematic achievement. I was delighted in viewing this film, especially when you have the talents of Bogart, Holt and Huston¬Ö..oh what abilities or should I say ¬ëgifts'.

My eyes never strayed from the screen, I couldn't take the risk of missing one second of this tremendous adventure/drama film. Bogart played the character ¬ëFred C. Dobbs' so convincingly, it doesn't surprise me though he was at his career peak. It was like his portrayal of ¬ëLt. Comdr. Philip Francis Queeg' in `The Caine Mutiny' surely no one would disagree he carried the part to it's limit.

The B & W format gave an added depth and the direction by John Huston (as usual) was nothing more then what I would expect from an accredited director like him. I was amused to see a very young Robert Blake in the role of the boy selling lottery tickets and the brief appearance of Bruce Bennett as ¬ëJames Cody'¬Ö. whom starred with Bogie in `Sahara' several years prior. Another reliable support actor was Alfonso Bedoya as ¬ëGold Hat' my fondest memory of any of his acting roles must be `The Big Country' in 1958.

Walter Huston stood out with his performance, this was the first time I've had the privilege to watch him in a film role. His portrayal was astounding¬Ö..and the script he had to work with was a treat to hear.

Another funny point I want to point out, I don't know why I kept comparing Tim Holt to John Derek. In some of the scenes his appearance and voice were so similar to Derek's it was uncanny. I'm probably the only one who thinks this, but I can't dismiss the similarities (to me anyway).

The plot was an interesting one, one that slowly draws you in until you can't stop watching. I really enjoyed `The Treasure Of Sierra Madre' certainly a ¬ëmust see' film¬Öhighly recommended."

The movie is deliberately slow, there's no heart-pounding action or slapstick comedy, and certainly no ""top stars"" (although you could say that Roberto Benigni has since become one). Set in New Orleans, it portrays three men - Zack (Tom Waits), Jack (John Lurie), and Roberto (Benigni) - who get put in jail together. All these men were always sort of down on their luck: Zack was framed for murder, Jack was found with an under-aged girl, and Roberto was involved in a murder. Anyway, the three of them escape from jail and have to cooperate to survive while on the lam. But even when they manage to break free from each other, there remains the question of each man's future.

Like I said, this is not for everyone; Jim Jarmusch is certainly an acquired taste. Many people will probably find the movie boring. But for me, it's a good representation of American independent cinema. Also starring Nicoletta Braschi, playing an Italian woman named Nicoletta."

This is symbolized greatly in `Cool Hand Luke'. We can identify with Luke because his crime is venial and his concerns over the great questions of life are ours. It is because of this and his persuasive charm that the other prisoners (played remarkably well by Kennedy and a host of others to include Wayne Rogers, Ralph Waite, Dennis Hopper and one of the actors who played a crewmember on `Alien') live vicariously through him.

Filled with memorable scenes (the boxing match, 50 eggs, the fealty of his fellow prisoners who help him finish his food after his stomach is shrunk in solitary confinement, `shakin' it here boss', the sneezing dogs, and of course the carwash part) and outstanding character development (created by what is said and what is not said, i.e. the visiting brother), one of screen history's most repeated lines and the great acting of Newman, this movie deserves to be called a classic.

The Great Dictator is just a wonderful satire on the Anti-Semitic Nazi regime- Hitler mayn't have got the joke in this comedy, but I think he got the point.

The Great Dictator looks great, with some great dialogue and a chockful of great moments, comedic or not. It is also excellently directed, and features wonderful performances from Paulette Goddard, Jack Oakie and especially the comedy genius himself. The Great Dictator has many great moments as I've said, but three scenes stand out especially. One is the barber dancing in time to a Hungarian dance by Brahms. Another is Hynkel's solo ballet with a globe of the world. My favourite though is the final speech, pleading for universal tolerance. Mawkish and outrageous it is, but also very powerful and quite ambitious if you put it in context(I can only imagine the controversy that scene alone caused).

Overall, wonderful and powerful. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

Bogey and Bacall are obviously a joy to watch and share a wonderful chemistry here (as in all their films together). Their performances are as strong as I've seen. The plot just tries to do far too much. I was so confused that I had to google the plot afterwards to help me understand what happened. It detracted from the film.

It also felt like a 3 hour long film. The Big Sleep was never a more fitting title for a film that despite a complex plot, often felt slow-moving. Yes, it has classic actors performing well. Yes, it has that classic black and white noir feel. Yes, it has memorable lines. But do all those things necessarily make a film enjoyable to watch? No.

Bit disappointed with this one, as it started so promising. After the viewer endures so much confusion throughout, the ending did nothing to satisfy and was rather weak.

Gut-wrenching stuff. A tale of friendship, the senseless carnage of war, the importance of a free press, the sins of America, and the cruelty of communism under Pol Pot. Mostly it shows incredible courage set to human tragedy and the jaw-dropping scenery of Cambodia. The cinematography is sublime, the gore, often to innocent people and their kids, is horrifying.

As moving as the film is, I wish it had been told completely from the POV of Dith Pran (Haing S. Ngor), the Cambodian translator/journalist who ends up imprisoned after his family and Western journalists escape (including those played by Sam Waterston and John Malkovich). I would have liked to have seen his family life before the war, the dialogue in Khmer subtitled, and a little more Cambodian context. The first half of the film is certainly good, but suffers because of its attention on the Western journalists.

However, it begins soaring at about the 90 minute point when Waterston is sitting in his NY apartment listening to Nessun Dorma from Puccini's Turnadot, and then cuts to Pran toiling in the mud with other captives at gunpoint. Those moments gave me goosebumps. We then see Pran suffering at the hands of brainwashed kids who are toting weapons and putting the populace through reeducation camps, and it's gripping. I can think of few better scenes that depict the horror of war and genocide than when he stumbles through that endless field of skulls and bones. Whenever the film focused on Waterston or Malkovich, such as that silly argument they have in the bathroom, my interest waned a bit, even though I admired the courage of the characters and their convictions.

That second half overall is brilliant though, and it's inspiring that it's a true story, with Pran ultimately joining his friend at The New York Times. That last line, coming from a guy who has been through hell, is stunning: ""Nothing to forgive, Sydney. Nothing."" It's too bad it's set to John Lennon's Imagine; as fantastic as that song is (probably my all-time favorite), it's misplaced here."

Sean Connery and Michael Caine play a couple of shysters who want to establish themselves as leaders of some obscure foreign country and then rob it of its riches. The plot never made a whole lot of sense to me, even though the screenplay had the clear blueprint of Rudyard Kipling's original story to follow. Huston is pretty high on my list of overrated directors; a few of his films from the film noir years are excellent, but most everything else falls flat for me. His direction in this film is too leaden to bring it alive. It's supposed to have a bit of rollicking adventure about it, but it instead feels like a slog.

531,Shine (1996),22-Nov-1996,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"['Drama', 'Romance']"," Tortured genius, domineering father, piano music, blah, blah, et cetera. ""Shine"" may be a good movie, but its best friends couldn't call it special.

The script isn't at all strong and Hicks tries to make up the deficit with creative presentation of one kind or another. David is obsessed - at any rate, the film is obsessed, it's not clear to what extent David is - with Rachmaninov's third piano concerto (implausibly referred to as the ""Rach 3""), the first movement in particular. We never quite hear this movement. We hear in the background on an old gramophone (throbbing dotted notes in the bass entirely inaudible); its themes are woven into the film's score; and in the big climactic scene where David plays it in public for the first time, sound effects are distorted so that we hear almost everything EXCEPT Rachmaninov's music as it really is. And clearly a lot of work went into arranging the shots in that climactic scene. The result is a much more creatively presented ""moment of truth"" than is usual in this kind of film.

If the presentation isn't threadbare clich√©, though, much of the content is. ""Shine"" does all the standard scenes very well - moments of triumph here, moments of despair there - but lacks an overall story that might make some sense of them. (This is particularly odd given that Scott Hicks felt not at all concerned with sticking to the facts of Helfgott's life, or even getting it vaguely right.) In the end it feels like an exceptionally well made nothing very much. Watch it for the performances - those of Noah Taylor and Geoffrey Rush in particular."
532,Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love (1996),07-Mar-1997,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,['Romance']," I believe that I would like to place a moment of blame on this film. Due to the title alone, I was nervous about viewing it with the windows open. Prior to my viewing, I was unaware that it was directed by famed director Mira Nair, and was fully prepared to draw my blinds as I embarked on this film adventure. The title was Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love, what was I to assume. After watching nearly two hours of this film, I was disappointed. I was upset with not only the lack of commitment to the characters, the tired storyline, and the anti-climactic ending, but also due to the lack of sexuality surrounding this film. ""Kama Sutra"" headlines this feature, but alas, it is not the central focus, and this is where I believe Nair failed us and my moment of blame was born. I would like to make it clear that I did not desire a film of pornography, I knew that this was a ""mainstream"" film, but I did want something deeper and centered around the art of ""Kama Sutra"" instead of just another clich√© story of rival girlfriends. I realize that I am generalizing the overall theme of this film, but at the core of this movie it was not about the art of sex, but instead the decay of man.

I did not like this film. I understood this film to be considered an adult fairy tale, but alas, I never saw the elements of a fairy tale in this story. Written in part by Nair, I saw this film as her opportunity to demonstrate the power of a woman's sexuality over even the strongest of men. In a very small part she succeeded, but her attempt to build this opportunity failed with her characters. When you make a film centered on love, or the passion of its act, you must hire actors that will give the audience that sensation. The audience must feel the sweat, the energy, the excitement of what is happening on screen or it will fall swiftly into just another Skin-a-Max midnight movie. Sadly, Nair could not accomplish this. When her characters, whether it was Maya, Tara, Raj, or even Jai, were ""forced"" into the ""Kama Sutra"" part of the film, it felt scripted and staged. There was no instant passion between these characters, which destroyed, utterly ripped from its roots, any attempt that Nair had to create the theme of sexual independence. Without the fire behind her actor's eyes, the rest of the film fell to the wayside as just your ""average"" film.

Nair had another opportunity to capture back her audience with this film, but she never took it. Nair could have pulled a Gandhi-esquire moment for us by countering the horrible acting with beautiful images of India. Nair could have coupled the beauty of ""Kama Sutra"" with the beauty of the land, thus creating at least one moment of visual eye-candy for the viewers, but again, she did no such thing. The few moment of fresh scenery that we had seemed like it came from National Geographic stock footage. I realize that she was actually in India, but what concerned me was that I didn't feel like I was in India. Throughout the film I realized that I was sitting on my couch watching bad acting with recycled images of India. I was nowhere close to being swept away by a lavish love story. Wait. This wasn't an original lavish love story. This was nothing more than the clich√© story of two friends whom find themselves fighting over the same man with a foreign twist. Perhaps I needed more influx into India's culture or even more back-story on our smaller characters, but nothing took my breath away. The character's lack of passion cheated me, and now Nair's choice of scenery felt just as plastic.

Finally, I would like to say that (without giving anything away); the ending was rather lackluster. Void of emotion to our characters and obvious clich√© India images only strengthened the forgettable ending. Again, the title of this film was Kama Sutra, which invokes images of lust and passion, sadly the ending evoked nothing of the sort. There wasn't a care in the world for our characters, so why should we feel impassioned about them in the final climactic moments? I didn't. As I watched this film I felt as if I was on a Disney ride through India. The tracks were in place so my cart couldn't go off the forsaken path, while the robotic characters did what they were supposed to do without any surprises or excitement. The only character (and I hate to go back on this rant again, but it is the central reason this film fell hard) worth enjoying was that of Naveen Andrews, but I think it is because of his Lost connection. By the time the ending finally happened, I was sculpting my own story in rock and hoping that Hollywood would produce it.

Overall, this film did have potential, but by giving it a name like Kama Sutra it over promised and ultimately did not deliver. Again, I would like to make it clear that I was not hoping for a heavily sexual film, but it needed to be a stronger point in the story than just a ""quick-cut"" or a side quest. Kama Sutra failed because of its characters and their obvious lack of devotion to the story. There were no surprises, there was no excitement, and there was no romance, just clich√© plot points that you can see in any film across the fine Earth. Could Nair been more adventurous? This reviewer thinks so. She could have taken us off the beaten path, deeper within the darkness, but instead she glossed over the truth giving us a Kama Sutra that was more pastel than passionate.

533,"Daytrippers, The (1996)",21-Mar-1997,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,['Mystery']," Daytrippers is a progressive drama about a family that takes an adventure into New York City after Eliza (Hope Davis) discovers a love letter that may uncover an affair between her husband and somebody named Sandy. Anne Meara does a good job as the typical East Coast, controlling mother. The indie-film queen Parker Posey plays Eliza's little sister whose boyfriend Carl, played by Liev Schreiber, is an exaggeration of the young, snobbish, know-it-all author. The family is hardly functional which makes this film particularly honest.

The key to Daytrippers is not the plot, which never fails to keep you watching, but the dialogue and the situations. Pay close attention to the characters that the family meets in the city. They all embody some kind of contradictions that make you think a little bit. Look for the scene where Marc Grapey begins describing his sexual exploits by condemning such practices.

If you are looking for a drama that provokes you, this is one of them. There are no happy endings and none of the issues raised are resolved. Fans of Parker Posey will especially enjoy her performance in this one."
534,Traveller (1997),18-Apr-1997,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," Films about con men can go a lot of ways. They can be intelligent with a worthwhile and earned payoff (2004's Criminal), they can be hollow, nonsensical, all flourish and no gravity (2003's Confidence) or deviate any which way from these examples. Traveller takes the quaint indie route, meaning I'm probably the sole person on the planet who has even heard of it, despite Marky Mark Whalberg appearing on one of the starring roles. It's a shame because this is a bona fide gem, a low key little charmer with a roguish lead performance from Bill Paxton, a plot that gets cleverer the more you ruminate on it afterwards, and an easygoing style to it. Marky Mark plays Pat, a young man descended from Irish 'travellers', who are essentially gypsy hustlers and live as such in a sleepy North Carolina community. Pat wants to reconnect with his roots, but his kinfolk are a tribal bunch who don't really fancy outsiders, however distantly related they may be. Cousin Bokky (Paxton) is the only one to take him under his wing, showing the ropes of a very specific, time honoured idiosyncratic lifestyle. Pat is young, cocky and sticks out like a sore thumb in Bokky's world, who himself is weathered and moves about with ease and experience, slowed down by the dynamic which his young prodigy presents, and also looking for a way out of this life, and even romance with gorgeous Julianna Margulies. As light as these proceedings are, the film doesn't fail to show the give dangers that being a con man puts them face to face with. It's all fun and games until... well until it isn't, and we get to see some of that ugliness rear it's head, for without it there would be no stakes. Joining them is grizzled and now deceased character actor James Gammon, playing a salty veteran grifter who crosses their paths more than a few times, causing as much trouble in the process. I've not a clue how close to real life fact and tradition this film gets, but I imagine fairly on the nose, as it just has that notion that it knows what it's doing, it's researched, capable, and does it all with ease and enjoyment."

all, I found this 'romance' unappealing...something better

536,Ponette (1996),23-May-1997,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," Ponette is a 4 year old girl who has survived a car crash that killed her mother. Victoire Thivisol is the actress who plays Ponette. Other than a few scenes with adults, this young girl carries the entire film. She is amazing! Her interaction with the other children is real - you forget that she is ""acting"". In one particular scene, Ponette sheds tears for her mom - the tears are real. Director Jacques Doillon has a magic touch with all of the young actors in this film. His extreme close-ups of their faces vividly reveals their emotions.

For 92 minutes you are brought into Ponette's world. You share in her grief, her friendships, her imagination and her innocence. In doing so, you also escape back into your own childhood. By seeing everything through Ponette's eyes, you recall all of the different kids most of us grew up with. You also see how confusing it can be for a child when adults tell them tales just to appease them.

Ponette desperately wants her mother back. In some fine examples of how impressionable and vulnerable children can be, Ponette will try or do anything to get her back. To soothe Ponette, her aunt tells her that like Jesus, her mom will come back from the dead. This results in Ponette isolating herself from her cousins and waiting every day on the top of a hill for her mom to appear.

In a poignant scene, which shows how mean kids can be at times, a boy tells Ponette that her Mom is dead because she wasn't a nice child, but Ponette fights back and stands up for herself. In another scene, which depicts the ""bossy"" kid, a young girl tells Ponette that she can be a ""child of God"" and speak to her mom but first she has to pass a variety of little tests such as jumping from stone to stone without touching the dirt (which the girl depicts as hot lava from Hell).

Throughout the film you watch and FEEL Ponette's growing pains. The emotions will be mixed. You'll see Ponette grow as a person but you'll also see Ponette lose some of that precious childhood innocence. In order not to spoil the ending for anyone, I'll just say two words about it: Mystical & Sweet.

The film is in French with English subtitles, but please don't let this discourage you. After 5 minutes you'll have escaped back to your childhood and you won't even realize you're reading.

Mike Waters is a young drifter who works as a male prostitute. He has had a very difficult childhood because his mother was mentally ill and he discovers, but maybe he had always known, that his brother is his father. This is probably the cause of his narcolepsy. He don't succeed in overcoming his past and the narcolepsy, making him fall suddenly asleep, takes him away from the real life and brings him in the life he always have dreamt, exactly his own private Idaho. In fact Mike, in the beginning and in the end of the film awakens on the street for the Idaho because this is the place where all is problems have starts and from which he has to restart if he wants to go on. The street is one of the symbolic images: he can decide to cross it, going on with is real life, or ramain at the point of starting. Another symbolic image is that of leaping fish that try to sail up a stream that reflect just his impossibility to overcome his past. This film is surely the greatest Gus Vas Sant's one , one of my favourite director. A shocking drama of uncommon strength and beauty. The actors are the best they would have been, River Phoenix is superlative (this is his greatest performance too and I am very happy that he had been rewarded with the `Coppa Volpi' just in my country, Italy), Keanu Reeves gives also a good performance in a very complex role, Udo Kier gives great charm and charisma to his character and James Russo a strong dramatic charge. The cinematography is excellent as well as the soundtrack through which song there is the beautiful Madonna's song `Cherish' that stress the Mike's search of a person who loves him (who cherishes him), a man or a woman this does't matters. During the films all his hope seem to be shattered but the end of the film leaves an open door to different interpretations: Make falling asleep and being bundled into a car by a stranger¬Ö..he will finally go on and find a person that cares for him or he comes back again to Idaho?"
538,Anastasia (1997),01-Jan-1997,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['Animation', ""Children's"", 'Musical']"," Anastatsia is without doubt one of the best animated movies ever made, for several reasons. It's an amazing story, filled with adventure, romance, smart dialog and wonderful music. The story is set in Russia and other parts of Europe, both in the wonderful palaces of the Czar family and the french countryside. It tells the story of the lost princess Anastasia, and uses the rumors that she as the only one of the Romanov family survived the massacre during the Russian revolution. Anya, a girl with no memory of her past, meets with two men of questionable professions that promise to take her to Paris, if she's willing to try to convince the Dowager Emperess that she might be Anastasia... Unfortunately, the evil sorcerer Rasputin (the man who killed the Romanov family) also knows that Anya is alive, and swears to kill her, whatever the cost... So Anya is taken on a magical adventurous ride through Europe, to find her family.

One of the best things about the movie is the characters. They seem so real, like real persons, not platonic, ""a beautiful damsel in distress"", ""a handsome hero"" end of story... The music is wonderful, better than in many Disney movies, and the story very good.

The only things I don't like about the film, is the things that's dangerous about making movies about real historical events. The Romanov Family weren't the innocents victims they're painted out to be, and the fact that the story is based on that... But I've only started to think about this now when I'm older, so... Anyone who likes a good movie, rent or buy Anastasia. It's worth it.

I should recommend the Swedish version, if someone here was to see it. Helen Sj√∂holm is the singer of Anya's role, and she is one of the best singers in Sweden..."

It is an offensive, unpleasant viewing experience that is quite possibly one of the worst and most misguided films ever committed to celluloid. Its sole redeeming feature (for adults only) is the rather titillating, Laurel and Hardy homage, as one of the brothers tries to comically seduce two beautiful girls (who later appear with outlandish hairdos revealing a lot of cleavage). If the entire film had been like that, it would have been a great film (though still not for children, but at least adults could have enjoyed it!). As it is, it feels like the viewer is watching two distinctly different movies: 1) the horrid, grotesque, violent ""mouse hunt"" and 2) a charming modern update of Laurel & Hardy, which does not mesh well with the rest of this cinematic garbage Spielberg and Company call a movie. Shame on everyone responsible for this mess. I found this film slightly less offensive than the recent DENNIS THE MENACE film, which also contained completely inappropriate levels of gruesome violence and torture (of the homeless, no less!) for a so-called ""children's movie."""
540,Money Train (1995),01-Jan-1995,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Action']," The late 80s, early 90s was THE decade of buddy-cop comedy/action movies, and this is just one of those in a long line of them which graced (well more or less) our movie-screens. Every one has their favourite, from the classic Lethal Weapon series, back in the days when Mel Gibson was still sane, to the much later Bad Boys, the film that truly launched Will Smith's film career. Money Train was written by the same writer who gave the latter of those buddy-cop movies, and it really shows. You find the same kind of street-slang jokes and buddy camaraderie in both movies, but whereas the two cops in Bad Boys were childhood friends, in Money Train they are actually brothers. Well foster-brothers, which explains the fact one is black, one is white, and cue all the imaginable jokes you can think of with this type of sibling affinity. And not only are they foster-brothers, but partners in some New-York cop department which protects the Underground tube system.

Unfortunately, the chemistry between Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson isn't even close to that between Smith and Lawrence. They each respectively turn-out decent performances, Snipes is as cool as ever and Harrelson does his usual quirky, slightly goofy routine, which is all very entertaining; however they just never quite jell together. Then you add to the equation Jennifer Lopez as the women interest, in what was her first major big-screen roll. This only has two positive effects, first and obviously she does add some female charm to this 99% male cast, and secondly she makes her present acting seem to be of the same caliber as Diane Keaton!

As with a number of other mediocre cop movies, one major shortcoming is the lack of a distinct malignant unyielding adversary; someone to truly challenge our heroes while stimulating the audiences' affection for them. Here, the characters' ""nemesis"" are an uninspired boss/head-of-department tyrant type who only cares about protecting his ""money-train""(which transports the Whole of the Undergrounds' cash); and a grossly under-used Chriss Cooper. His pyromaniac thief character seems either to have been hugely cut from the original script, or simply appended at the last minute to add some kind of dramatic tension.

An entertaining movie with a very decent script, to be watched without any too high expectations. The beginning drags-on for a while but the pace does build-up to an acceptable level after a while. Money Train could have been a lot better if it had been handled by a more competent director."

One of many of these examples include Super Mario Bros (1993) and Street Fighter (1994) which instantly spring to mind. Mortal Kombat has the distinction of being the few of the better video game to movie adaptations.

Based on the controversial best selling ultra violent video game, the movie centres on Shaolin monk Liu Kang (Robin Shou) out to avenge the death of his brother at the hands of Shang Tsung (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa), actor Johnny Cage (Linden Ashby) out to prove that he is not just a pretty face, and special forces officer Sonya Blade (Bridgette Wilson) who is in hot pursuit of criminal Kano (the late Trevor Goddard). Liu Kang, Johnny Cage and Sonya Blade are handpicked by the god of thunder Raiden (Christopher Lambert) as contenders for the Mortal Kombat tournament to claim triumph over the Outworld to prevent the Emperor Shao Kahn from invading Earth.

Assisted by Princess Kitana and Raiden, the trio must also battle a variety of opponents including Scorpion, Sub Zero, Reptile, Goro and lastly Shang Tsung.

Director Paul W.S. Anderson (Resident Evil, Alien Vs Predator) keeps the plot straightforward and ensures the movie remains faithful to the video game. The acting won't net any awards but all did a fine job. The movie could have been added to the list of box office disasters but audiences, in particular fans of the video game, got a kick out of the movie and consider it to be a flawless victory.

Mortal Kombat is certainly a worthy video game to movie adaptation. It is still a fun movie.

542,Pocahontas (1995),01-Jan-1995,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,"['Animation', ""Children's"", 'Musical', 'Romance']"," Disney hit a rut in the late-90s with a string of critical and audience failures that began with Pocahontas and lasted through Hunchback, Hercules, Dinosaur etc. It was also one of two historically- inaccurate movies starring ""Mad"" Mel Gibson that came out in Fall 1995 in the UK. Both of which I never got to see until much later.

From a technical standpoint there is nothing wrong with Pocahontas, as a matter of fact it's far more colorful, atmospheric, and grown-up than The Lion King, which came out a year before. But in the process it lost much of its younger audience and now only seems to appeal to adults. The story lets everything else down. It's so bland and generic when it could have had the moxie to go much further and be just a tad more complex. It certainly had the visual energy to back it up even it were to try and fail. Alan Menken's score is also horrible and totally inappropriate to the scenes he is supposedly enhancing. Songs come and go, some last only a few moments. If feels like instead of letting the visuals speak for themselves Disney decided that characters talking to each other (at the audience) as a means of delivering exposition was too obvious so instead this dialogue is sung. The songs are exposition. Rarely do they allow any visual storytelling to stand alone. John Smith's first encounter with Pocahontas at the waterfall being the best example of what the film could have been if only.

Despite being historically-inaccurate (why is she not topless?) it really only details the first half of the Pocahontas story. The second (and more tragic) half is (sorta) detailed in the cash- grab sequel that nobody remembers. I cannot imagine anyone being smitten by this film unless they are already familiar with Pocahontas as the stripped-down story is hardly likely to win over anyone new to this slice of romantic history."

The whole film just sits really well - all the small background details help the plot, flesh out the characters and culture or provide telling counterpoints to the situation.

All prerequisites for movies of a certain quality and after saying all that - I'd usually be complaining about now.

Yet for one reason I can't. This movie really entertained me. It finds a way to come together in a really enjoyably manner and I'm happy with what I got. I can't bad mouth it. Nothing got in my way of everlasting enjoyment of seeing baddies die, bombs going off and the baritone guitar instrumental. It just all clicks from the get-go.

If your reading this you don't need me to recycle the plot summary. It's of a trivial nature. Good action, decent cast and a fun atmosphere go a long way with Travolta ultimately holding it all together. He plays his role to the hilt and delivers some fantastic lines. Him and Slater tango pretty well too. Travolta makes for a great bad guy and good action movies require great bad guys.

It is a children's movie distributed by Miramax, who has made dozens of Oscar-winning films over the last 30 years. It has special effects by Cinemagic and the Jim Henson Creature Shop, and Jack Black stars in it. You would want to see it, right? Well, not if it's ""The NeverEnding Story III"".

""The NeverEnding Story III"" is disappointing in every sense of the word. It is by far one of the worst sequels ever made, and it does a disservice to the book by Michael Ende and the original 1984 film on which it is based (My review: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088323/usercomments-250).

This movie takes characters from the book and creates a new story that is full of plot holes, bad puns, and very little logic whatsoever. It helps very little that none of the cast members from either of the first two movies were involved in this film.

This time, Bastian is played by Jason James Richter (""Free Willy"" (1993)). Although Richter looks like a preteen model, he is still harassed by a gang at his new school known as the Nasties (or the Nastys) whose leader is Slip, played by a then-unknown Jack Black.

As it turns out, Bastian's new school also happens to be where Coreander, the owner of the book store in the original story, works as a librarian. British actor Freddie Jones plays Coreander in this movie, and fans of the original may be disappointed not to see Thomas Hill reprise his role. I don't blame them.

Anyway, Coreander happened to bring the NeverEnding Story with him to this school library. It's a pretty contrived way to bring the book back into the story after the main character has moved away if you ask me.

What's even more contrived is when Bastian, hiding from the Nastys, retreats into the world of Fantasia, only to have Slip retrieve the book, realize its powers, and try to destroy the world and Bastian. In the book and the first two movies, the reader had little to no control over how the NeverEnding Story would be told. How the Nastys get control is never explained anywhere in the movie. The NeverEnding Story being an enchanted book is no excuse to cover up such plot holes.

When Bastian realizes he has to re-enter the real world to obtain the book and save Fantasia, the movie just gets worse. Even with the Oren (the token worn around the neck that resembles two snakes), Bastian alone can't make it back home. So a number of creatures from Fantasia have to wish with him, and be transported into his world, for him to save Fantasia.

Such a subplot wouldn't be so bad if the supporting characters weren't so annoying and intelligence insulting. There's the Rock-Biter's baby boy who talks in annoying ""baby talk"" that real children under 3 don't use as vernacular, an anthropomorphic tree who talks like an old Jewish comedian except not as funny, and two gnomes (Urgl and Engywook, featured in the first movie but played by different actors) who have a tired running joke about needing to use the bathroom.

Oh yes, and who could forget Falcor, the luck dragon? In the first two movies, Falcor was a hero to Atreyu and Bastian, and was the voice of reason in many situations. He also had a voice like Walter Cronkite, which made him ever cooler. Here, he not only looks different from the previous two films, but he's whinier and dumber. When, in the real world, he mistakes an airplane for a female luck dragon, I could only hang my head and wonder, ""Why?"".

To make matters worse, Bastian can't wish the book back after the Nastys stole it because he can't use the Oren to make wishes in the real world. That plot point is well and good, and makes a setup for a great conflict that adds to the story. Unfortunately, the people who wrote this screenplay forget that plot point and failed to explain why Bastian's stepsister Nicole (Melody Kay) could make wishes when she had possession of the Oren. Any script reviser could point out these plot holes, and it most especially amazes me that filming progressed despite these inconsistencies.

It is even more amazing that no one in this movie actually acts poorly. Richter does well in his role, despite his voice obviously cracking and no one noticing. I don't bring that point up to be mean. It's just that the filmmakers could have used his voice changing as a good subplot to explain why he's being picked on. But I digress.

The point is that everyone involved in this film just could not save the story having so many inconsistencies. By the end, the story bears no resemblance to Ende's original book at all. The Fantasia creatures are also too annoying, trying too hard to be comic relief and inundating their dialogue with uncharacteristic pop culture references. Case in point: the Rock Biter rides his bike while singing ""Born To Be Wild"" by Steppenwolf. What were these filmmakers thinking?

And you would think that the Jim Henson Creature Shop working on your side would be a valuable asset in this film. In this case, none of the recurring characters look like they did in the first two movies (the Rock Biter, looking like a pint-size version of his predecessor, was the biggest disappointment), and they weren't strong characters either. They did not live up to Henson's high standards of storytelling and development. If you don't believe me, try finding this movie on Muppet Central. You would have had better luck finding this film in a theater that ran it for two weeks back when it was released."

This 1995 Historical Drama has Liam Neeson & Tim Roth delivering performances that are so sharp & effective, that, they even manage to the hold the film, when it falters.

Directed by Michael Caton-Jones, 'Rob Roy' stars Neeson as Robert Roy MacGregor, the famous Scottish folk hero and outlaw of the early 18th century, who battled with feudal landowners in the Scottish Highlands.

Robert Roy MacGregor's Journey On-Screen, is decent in parts. The Writing Material is slow and slightly deary in the first-hour, but picks up the second-hour and reaches to a memorable culmination. Michael Caton-Jones's direction is satisfactory. Cinematography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub is stunning. Editing is fair.

Performance-Wise: As told, Neeson & Roth rule the show with their sharp & effective performances. Neeson gets into the skin of the character, and plays a robin-hood of his time perfectly. Roth, on the other-hand, plays the bad guy, most effectively. Jessica Lange is adequate. John Hurt & Brian Cox are fairly good.

On the whole, A Must See for Neeson & Roth Fans!"

Well maybe that's a tad bit exaggerated but, still, the multiple sequences in which Natasha Henstridge walks around topless are unquestionably the most memorable moments of the entire movie. In her debut role, stunning Natasha plays a secret government project, namely the very first scientific hybrid of human and alien DNA. During the opening sequences, she's still a teenage girl but already incredibly strong and too dangerous to keep alive any longer. When project leader Fitch (Ben Kinsley) attempts to destroy her with gas, she escapes on a train and Michelle Williams transforms into Natasha Henstridge. What's the sole thing on a sexy blond alien's mind when she drifts through L.A. all by herself? Procreate, of course, and thus Sil (her codename) hooks up with random men as she's looking for the perfect sperm donor. Meanwhile, Fitch assembles an elite squad that'll be charged with hunting down Sil and annihilate her before she copulates the entire male population to death. ""Species"" is a pretty bad movie, yet horror and Sci-Fi fans will definitely find it entertaining due to its large amount of gore and trashy sleaze. The action-sequences are well illustrated and exciting but, as soon the script tries to be intellectual, the whole thing looks stupid and dreary. Especially the characters don't make much sense. Michael Madsen is (again) supposed to be a tough and merciless bounty hunter, but he has a gingerbread heart and falls for a dull female doctor. Kingsley is profiled to be the cold and heartless scientist but he can't even force his authority on a four-headed crew? Oh, and Forest Whitaker is the lousiest spiritual medium ever! ""Something has happened here"", he says whilst staring at the bloody aftermath inside the train carriage. Well duh! You're staring at corpse and the juicy leftovers of an alien cocoon!

I guess this is a love story but I'm not sure at all how the Keana Reeves ultimately became attached to the leading lady.

The gist of the story - The leading lady is pregnant and the father of the unborn child has disappeared. She has to go home with the shame and gets on a bus where she meets Keanu. They talk and Keanu decides to go with her with under the guise of meeting and making her family believe he's a bum by running out on her. However, things don't go as planned and by movie's end, they're in love and everything works out.

The story to me was like mashed potatoes, all the potatoes get thrown together and you get a final product, in this case a not very cohesive movie. The point I'm getting at is that this movie does a poor job at telling it's story. It appears that the director must have took a day off and let their assistant(s) finish shooting the film. I think there are plenty of undiscovered scripts waiting to be discovered and filmed - too bad some one didn't find one to replace this yawner.

I'm still puzzled about the grapes though..."

*** (out of 4)

Talk all you want about how this thing was a bomb at the box office. I've personally never seen how good or poorly a movie does at the box office should have any impact on its entertainment or quality level. Is WATERWORLD flawless? Not even close. There are countless problems with this film but for the most part I've always enjoyed its ambition and it keeps me entertained. The story is pretty simple as in the future all the world is covered by water, although there's rumors of land somewhere. A part-man, part-fish (Kevin Costner) gets involved with a family (Jeanne Tripplehorn, Tina Majorino) and soon must defeat some bad guys (led by Dennis Hopper) who has kidnapped the girl. WATERWORLD runs on a bit too long, loses focus on any type of story and yes the budget was crazy but in the end it's still a pretty entertaining summer blockbuster. I think a lot of credit has to go to the actual look of the film, which of course turned out to be some of the biggest issues with the production. I thought the director managed to do a good job creating a world where the viewer really did feel was nothing but water. The futuristic atmosphere also worked and the look of the costumes, ships and supplies were all realistic and fun. The action scenes were also extremely well handled and especially the ending with all the explosions and fires. The battles at sea were really just things we had previously seen in pirate movies but they were still fun. Costner also turns in a good, not great, performance in the lead and he at least keeps you interested in everything going on. Hopper delivers that crazy type of performance we all love and Tripplehorn is good in her supporting bit. Majorino is also fun as the young girl who befriends Costner. I remember watching this when it was originally released and everyone was going crazy about the budget. Everyone seemed to forget that the people leaving the theater actually liked the movie. It's too bad WATERWORLD was doomed from the start but it remains a fun movie."

That combination may sound like fun, and at times, it is, but for the most part, this is one convoluted mess that cannot live up to the name Wild Bill Hickock, though it is slick and stylish in its development and execution.

It was as if the filmmakers did not think that the beautiful music and sumptuous settings could carry the film. I don't know if something was lost in the subtitling, or whether too much film was left on he cutting room floor, but I was baffled by a number of the characters. Who was Benjamin and why did he wear a body brace? Who were Alexandra and Margareth? The characters simply seemed to be a device to move the story along to the bizarre and unnecessary sex scenes.

My biggest problem was with the poor lip synching, which was so obvious that it distracted and spoiled the flow of the film. It was not just that the facial mannerisms did not match the voice, but that the volume actually dropped to the extent that the voice seemed to be coming from off stage. Nowhere was this worse than the trumpet scene at the beginning. The castrati had very powerful voices, but Farinelli's voice sounds like a far-off squeak. Synching has been done very successfully in the past, most notably by Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady and Ava Gardner is Show Boat, and most famously by Edmund Purdom in the Student Prince, so it should not be beyond the capability of film makers 40 or more years later. I felt that the film would have been more convincing if Farinelli had been played by a soprano doing her own singing, and had concentrated more on the relationship with the brother who was riding on Farinelli's coat tails. How often have we seen a partnership where one half is nothing without the other, and knows it.

As for the comparison with the decadent rock star life style, that is how the castrati stars allegedly lived in the hedonistic 18th-century. I am not sure either that the castrati strutted around the stage like drag queens as they were supposed to be playing the women's parts as women. Given Ken Russell‚Äôs record of appallingly bad taste portrayals of musicians, it is surprising that he never attempted this one. It was right up his street.

Like the overwhelming majority of people, I didn't know about the real crime behind the story of this film, where the friendship between two teenagers turns into a sexual and romantic obsession and leads the two young women to kill the mother of one of them, in hope that they can run away or stay together.

Directed by Peter Jackson, still a long way from dreaming that he would be as successful as ""The Lord of the Rings"", the film is excellent and does a great job in terms of recreating the events and psychology of the two central characters. Of course, according to what I've read, the facts are not entirely clear as to the nature of the relationship the two girls had, but it seems quite clear that, at the very least, there was a very strong obsession between them and a certain dissociation from reality. , through the creation of a fantasy alternative world that functioned as an escape. The film shows us this clearly and manages to maintain a certain ambiguity where it seems most necessary.

This was the debut film for young Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynksey. None of them seem exactly like newcomers or inexperienced in the cinematographic art, which can only be a revealing parameter of talent, and of the great qualities that both have revealed since then, most especially Winslet, who has dedicated more time to cinema and achieved a different level of recognition. In addition to them, we also have the excellent performances by Sarah Peirse, Clive Morrison and Diana Kent, in the role of three of the paternal figures.

Technically, the film doesn't have any major problems. The pace is ideal, there are no dead moments or situations that seem to be too much or to have been stilted, and the editing is very good and well executed. The cinematography is excellent, with great color and light, particularly in the fantasy scenes, where we enter the fantastic world that these young women created for themselves. The sets are good and, together with the costumes, recreate the period portrayed with verisimilitude. The filming locations are magnificent, very well selected and used. The soundtrack is equally good."

A reporter interviews a vampire, Louis, and we learn about his life and loves through his retellings. Brad Pitt stars as Louis, a man who tragically lost his family and in the process lost his desire to live. Antagonist vampire Lestat (Tom Cruise) came to his rescue. Or did he? Did het not condemn him to eternal misery instead of saving him?

Indeed so. We see Louis battling coming to terms with his new life - that as a vampire. Although Louis and Lestat are now both vampires, they couldn't be more different, and I found this an interesting approach to the age old vampire traditions and traits. I once read writer Anne Rice was upset upon learning Cruise was cast as Lestat, being ""the wrong person for the role."" However, Cruise is so fantastic as Lestat that she personally apologized to him afterwards. Tom Cruise truly is incredible in this film. For someone who was supposedly one of the most unlikely candidates for the role, Cruise seems all too perfect!

'Interview with the Vampire' is a stylish film with great costumes and cinematography, with beautiful settings and production design. The make-up is also excellent. There are a lot of very disturbing images, though, and a lot of blood sucking scenes - many of which are gross. Due to the graphic nature of the film it certainly is not recommended for everyone, and most definitely not for kids. You're going to have to choose your audience well with this film.

First of all, if this kid managed to survive the first 5 minutes without getting an arrow put through him or beheaded by a broadsword, and he managed to avoid being taken prisoner and made a gay soliders plaything, he would most likely die of many diseases that his body wasn't accustomed to. Also, even you do have a magical place to plug in a stereo you play rock and roll for guards at a middle age castle, youll be labled as a heritic and executed. but dying aside, the middle ages just werent that cool, disease and warfare were everywhere, people lived in disgusting conditions that even mother theresa would run away from, and there was no place for the weak, you either fought or you died and if you werent tough, you were probably killed.

John Cleese,especially,makes a very memorable part as the mysterious mentor Professor Waldman,which shows Frankenstein the secrets of Life.

And not to forget Kenneth Brannaghs characterization of the manic, desperate and not too forget intense Dr. Victor Frankenstein is completely without competition.

It's in this part Brannaghs sense of Dramatical flare and theatrical intensity really comes into its right, and manages to put the madness of Frankenstein into an incredible sharp relief.

You get an understanding of why Frankenstein does what he does.. The Death of his mother,the want to beat Death, all of these factors formed Frankenstein up to the moment where he creates and reanimates the Monster

Ah, The Monster.. In all the excitement I almost forget Robert De Niro's excellent rendition of the monster. In his characterization the monster isn't just a lifeless and soulless being,but a humane being with wishes,desires,wants and lusts..

He feels and experiences everything with such a strenght and intensity as noone really can describe. And he tries to adapt to a world which is completely hostile to his existence, even his Father he learns will not love him or know him.

The Monster is like a child, trying to cope with emotions and feelings much stronger than anything we can imagine or percieve. And maybe it is that which makes the Monster so reckognizable?. Because he is us, and we are him?"

It's set in the oh-so-ironically named lawless town of Redemption, a haven of grotesques that gives us an idea what the wild West would've looked like if had been painted, not by Frederic Remington, but by Heironymus Bosch.

In a surfeit of Biblical nomenclature, the town's mayor/owner/capo is named Herod (Gene Hackman at his oiliest, complete with bad hair). Into town there rides a mysterious stranger, not Clint Eastwood this time but Sharon Stone. I'm not the world's biggest Stone fan, but this movie and ""Total Recall"" indicate that she has her uses in kick-butt action roles that make no demands on her limited thespianic skills. As gunslinger Ellen, she's doubly armed--with a six-shooter, and with an axe to grind; even her ""inner child"" packs a gun. She enters Herod's to-the-death fast-draw tournament, a no-win, no-exit, potentially no-survivors affair, with an agenda on her mind other than just winning the prize money.

This is an overripe, over-wrought movie, but it mostly works. Raimi all but erases the slim wall between the horror and Western genres: Redemption is another Transylvanian village of simple peasants lorded over by by an evil baron, and the atmosphere--palpably oppressive and claustrophobic--could be cut with a knife. Leonardo di Caprio and veteran character actors Lance Henriksen and Roberts Blossom effectively round out the cast, and the action scenes--exaggerated, mythic, often darkly humorous--deliver. If you're more of a horror fan than a Western fan, this may be the Western for you."

The original 'Tales from the Crypt' was a comic series in the early 1950s. There were concerns by puritanically-minded parents that the subversive aspects of these types of comics could corrupt the minds of children. A book written in 1954 by a psychiatrist, 'Seduction of the Innocent' greatly amplified these fears, and eventually Senate Subcommittee hearings were held on this matter. This eventually led to the formation of the Comics Code Authority, which issued the 'Comics Code' a set of rules by which publishers of comics would voluntarily abide.

By today's standards, the Comics Code is hilarious in its ludicrous austerity, but publishers used it to censor themselves for decades. It only became completely defunct in 2011. The research on which 'Seduction of the Innocent' was based has been largely discredited.

TALES FROM THE CRYPT (1972) began a long succession of movie and television adaptations, some of which were based on the original stories of the comics, and some of which were original. The film is an anthology of vignettes which all basically follow the same format: One person (or more) does something bad, and then they get their comeuppance in a most horrific manner by supernatural means. The vignettes are connected to each other by an overarching story in which they are actually narrations by a main character called the 'Crypt Keeper' to an audience, and the conclusion involves the revelation of a connection between the audience members and the stories told. Although heavy-handed and often bordering on the silly, the movie's greatest strength is its creepy, engaging atmosphere.

It turns out that the greatest asset of TALES FROM THE HOOD is also its atmosphere. The entire structure of TALES FROM THE CRYPT is adopted, almost without change, to tell stories which center on real social problems. The Crypt Keeper is replaced by a creepy mortician who tells these stories to a gang of thugs who are there to pick up a load of drugs he had found.

Within the overarching story 'Welcome to my Mortuary', there are four vignettes:

1.'Rogue Cop Revelation' is the story of a black ex-cop who quit his job after he did nothing to stop a trio of corrupt cops from murdering and framing a black activist. Of all the vignettes, this has the strongest vibe reminiscent of 1970s blaxploitation horror.

2.'Boys do get Bruised' tells of a young boy who keeps coming to school with bruises. When a concerned teacher tries to find out who did it, he says that it was a ""monster"" The teacher, obviously skeptical, goes to the boy's home to speak to his guardians, and finds out more than he expected.

3.'KKK Comeuppance' follows the haunting of a David Duke-type racist politician (actually named ""Duke"") who had made his political headquarters in a plantation home that was the location of a mass killing of African Slaves.

4.""Hard Core Convert"" explores the fate of a hardened criminal in prison who is given a second chance by undergoing behavior modification therapy strongly reminiscent of that in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE (1971). (This segment includes rapid flash sequences which might be unsuitable for some people who suffer from seizures).

Although there is variation in the quality of the stories, it is less so than the original TALES. However, the same kind of heavy-handedness and border-line silliness can also be found here. What helps a lot is that this movie has a good sense of humor, more than was in CRYPT, which reminds us not to take it too seriously. Another aspect that elevates it relative to the original is that the situations, however unrealistic, are based on real social issues.

There are definitely things to criticize in this film, but the deliciously over-the-top performance by Clarence Williams as the mortician, makes up for a lot of that. It is clear that this film is an homage to 70s horror. As a fan of that subgenre, I appreciate that."

This John Carpenterized version is a tad more gory and more colorful than the 1960 version.

The small town of Midwich one-day falls inexplicably asleep. Many accidents occur due to sudden narcolepsy, which is exaggerated in John Carpenter style. The result is that several of the village females including a virgin are in a motherly way. They all have their bouncing white hair babies the same day and as with the cuckoo eggs, they are too in love to notice the little quirks about having to control or mentally punish everyone. Compound this by other villages that fall to the same fate and you have an epidemic that threatens to wipe out the human race.

In the 1990 smash THE HUTN FOR RED October, as played by Alec Baldwin, he was in a race against time to find out whether a renegade Soviet submarine captain was out to defect to America, or out to launch. Then in 1992's PATRIOT GAMES, Ryan, then portrayed by Harrison Ford, went into action to protect his own family against the machinations of vengeful ultra-violent Irish Republican Army terrorists. And then in 1994, again with Ford more than capably assuming the role, Ryan found himself in a pickle much closer to his job: covert military action related to the ongoing Latin American drug war in CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER.

Ford's Jack Ryan is put into action into finding the root causes of why one of the closest friends of the President (Donald Moffatt) was killed on his boat in the Caribbean Sea. As it turns out, the president's dead friend had stolen money from a Colombian drug kingpin (Miguel Sandoval), like six hundred forty million dollars¬Öand change. For Ford, this may seem like a fairly routine matter, as is him having to go to Congress to get authorization to fund the Colombian government's war against drug cartels like Sandoval's. But unbeknownst to him, Moffatt, along with his national security adviser (Harris Yulin) and deputy CIA director (Henry Czerny) have hatched a covert operation called Operation Reciprocity to finish off the drug war on American terms, sending a paramilitary unit commanded by a man named Clark (Willem Dafoe) into the hot zone. More importantly, when his mentor Admiral Greer (James Earl Jones) falls victim to inoperable pancreatic cancer that ultimately kills him, the weight of the world falls on his shoulders. Dafoe's team does score hits against Sandoval's operation; but the end result is a series of horrific acts of retribution, including the killing of an FBI team sent to assist Ford, followed by the capture of Dafoe's men by an associate of Sandoval's (Joaquin De Almeida) out to take over Sandoval's operation.

Once Ford makes himself aware of the kind of paramilitary finagling that had been going on behind his back, he becomes a fighter once more‚Äînot for just his family, but the truth. This means having not only to go back down to the Colombian war zone to rescue Dafoe and his men, but also having to confront a president who has bent, and maybe even broken the law, for political points, and made decisions that resulted in massive losses of lives.

Philip Noyce, who had also directed PATRIOT GAMES, returns to the director's chair for this well made and, at close to two and a half hours, epic action/suspense thriller. Not surprisingly, Ford delivers the kind of performance that could easily be classified as a ""thinking man's action hero"" as Ryan, acting not on impulse or an urge for explosions of violence, but a vigilant search for the truth. Ultimately, he wonders, exactly what does constitute a ""clear and present danger"" in the real world? Is it what the president says it is, when it is in the form of drug cartels (who, by the early 2000s, proliferated far closer to the U.S., in rural sections of Mexico)? Or is the real clear and present danger found in a host of decisions merely meant to gain political points? Ford's performance remains the centerpiece of this film, but Sandoval and De Almeida make for a pair of crafty (but non-stereotypical) South American heavies (much of the film was shot in Mexico), and there are also underhanded performances by Yulin and, most especially Czerny, the latter of whom is absolutely oily and corrupt (he would play a similar role only two years later in MISSION IMPOSSIBLE). And when he is not recycling his scores for ALIENS and PATRIOT GAMES, James Horner's score is extremely effective too, veering from typically stirring patriotic Americana to ethnic South American motifs (with pan flutes).

Far too many action films from the 1980s onward are all about spectacle, and almost no suspense or substance. But CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER has a lot of those two important things in spades, and still ranks as one of the best films of the action genre during the 1990s."

It had the great idea of a killer killing people in their dreams. All of its sequels (except for part 2, which went in a horrible direction) just built on to that idea, and the idea wasn't scary anymore as the series progressed. Now with New Nightmare, Wes Craven came up with another original idea. It turns out that Freddy is in fact real, some kind of ancient evil that took the form of Freddy Krueger and could only be contained through storytelling, IE: the Nightmare On Elm Street movies. But since the series has ended, the genie is out of the bottle, and this ingenious film unravels.

I wouldn't say this movie is that scary, it's more creepy than it is scary, but I love its imagination. It plays mind little mind games and you wonder what is real and what is not. Freddy Krueger is even credited as ""himself"". It's a must-see for any Freddy fan and in many ways it stands on its own...but only if you've seen the other movies. If that makes any sense.

This is one of the best sequels in the Nightmare series and it's nothing short of brilliant. It's nice to see that Freddy is back in the bottle where he belongs, and hopefully will be for a long time...

He shows with a flair of his nostrils that he's assuming a new self awareness and sense of smell that comes with developing animal traits. That takes up about the first half of the movie.

It's when the plot goes into overdrive that we get into trouble. We witness him outsmarting a phony co-worker (JAMES SPADER, who seems to specialize in being nasty), and watch how he manipulates his boss (CHRISTOPHER PLUMMER) with his new skills.

It's a fascinating idea but doesn't get full development in the screenplay once the wolf has made its mark on Nicholson. Instead it becomes increasingly apparent that the writers were running low on ideas and the story was getting just a little too preposterous for comfort.

Still, if you're a JACK NICHOLSON fan, you owe it to yourself to see this one. MICHELLE PFEIFFER makes good eye candy but not much else can be said about her acting skills here."

Kevin Costner is fine as a younger Wyatt still searching for a direction. He's not so great as the drunken mess. Later he's OK as the lawman. He has the righteousness but not necessarily the gravitas. It's asking a lot to play this wide range for anybody.

The biggest problem is the general long winding life story. This is long, epic, and very long. It's like a biopic from a historian. It is too rambling and unfocused. Director Lawrence Kasdan does a good job filming the movie but this long biopic will always have problems. It's too rambling to create much tension or pick up any pacing. It's just overly ambitious."

And though we quote the movie and dress up as characters from it every Halloween the sad truth is that the world doesn't work like Another Stakeout. When you watch someone through a window of their home you don't end up falling in love and there isn't a buddy next to you to crack wise with. The police show up and people yell and cry...

Ordinarily I say ""to each his own"" when it comes to opinions about movies, but if you don't like AS 2 then you're not worth a cup of feces with a cigarette butt in it."

The film is in trouble from the opening shot, in which the camera pans over a rocky, wave-swept shore before settling over a moonlit prison which is obviously a model. ""Inside"" the ""prison"" is a far- from-model prisoner, Ryan Gaerity. Played by a long-haired, Gaelic-speaking (both for this scene only) Tommy Lee Jones, he fatally stabs his cellmate, then combines chemicals he's hidden in various places, including inside himself (yuck), and using the cell's filthy toilet (more ""yuck"") as a casing , he sets of an explosion that blasts a large hole in the stone wall (rather than doing something sensible like destroying the much more fragile toilet). Having gotten out of the cell block in about the most conspicuous way imaginable, the movie asks the audience to believe he then gets away scot-free.

The action then shifts to Boston, where crack bomb squad member Jimmy Dove (Jeff Bridges) is on a tough assignment. A young woman's estranged boyfriend has rigged her computer with explosives which will detonate if she stops typing or the computer's drive runs out of space, then shot himself (making this murder/suicide the only one ever in which the suicide part is done first). The rest of the bomb squad brings in a robot to take over the typing, but when the robot malfunctions, Jimmy shoos everyone else and the robot out of the room and puts the poor woman back behind the keyboard; one of the cops could have done this, but you gotta have a damsel in distress (groan). As Jimmy gets to work on the computer/bomb, the sight of the shot-dead man on the floor causes him to have a vivid flashback of an injured woman lying on the ground and calling ""Liam"", to let the audience know ""Jimmy"" has a secret. The flashback trigger is bizarre, since other than the horizontal position of the person, nothing else is the same. Plus, the flashback is in black and white; is Jimmy/Liam color blind? Wouldn't that be a serious handicap in his line of work?

The film continues in this illogical vein, with the shared past of the two main characters revealed, lots of bombs, some explosions, convoluted twists and turns, weird photography, cliches, shifting characters, bad writing, and overacting. In a film about bombs, the film itself was the biggest bomb of all. The film ""Speed"", released around the same time (keeping with that odd 1990's pattern of two movies with the same subject matter being released close together) had plenty of flaws, but worked a whole lot better than this film. A case study in bad cinema."

This time the story is set on a military base where Steve Malone moves in with his family. His job to look for toxins that might be at high levels in the grounds of the base, but soon strange things begin to happen and certain people ""aren't themselves anymore."" People who have seen the previous two versions know exactly what this means. However, whether you know or not the film manages to be an eerie thriller in parts. There is a change in perspective from the previous two versions as the focus here is more on the family, but it still remains in subtle ways as a parable. But it is that family aspect that gives this version its push. The examination of trust and mistrust within the family unsentimental and compelling. Carol's monologue to her husband Steve in a key moment will literally make you grow goosebumps. And the end, which will be familiar to those of you who've seen the previous version, has it's own spin and take on the situation and what led up to it. The way hope and despair are mixed and shown makes the ending worth seeing, but unexpectedly abrupt. Though, abrupt in this case means ""chilling."" That makes it not quite the first which ended in despair. Different from the second which was chilling, but final moment was that of terror. Here it is... just chilling.

Then the special effects are pretty good too with the pods getting just enough screen time to keep you thinking about what they are, but also enough to send shudders down your spine. --- 7/10

Cavanaugh (Julian Sands) is obsessed with the sexy but incredibly unlikable Helena (Sheryl Fenn) who he once had an affair with. When she pretty much rejects the guy, she ends up being hit by a truck. Does this deter him? No! It just means that he'll amputate her and keep her for himself.

Directed by David Lynch's daughter Jennifer, ""Boxing Helena"" is a movie that at first sounds like a perverse, strange little movie. Instead, it ends up being more of a mix of a pretentious art house movie and a dull 90's soft-core flick (complete with Enigma's song ""Sadeness"" playing during a sex scene.) Worst yet, the whole thing is a mess. The acting is atrocious, with Sands playing an unlikable, uninteresting, unsympathetic and spineless man, while Fenn plays a character so bitchy that you wonder why any man would want to be with her. Even Bill Paxton (someone I normally like) is unable to lift this up any, as he is also terrible (though that's more due to the terrible script.) At least his hair is outrageously bad, though it's no match for the one Art Garfunkle (yes, THAT Art Garfunkle) has. Add a terrible ending and obvious symbolism (a bird in a cage, how clever!) to the mix, and you get a terrible movie.

Little fact: While more is known about Kim Bassinger and the movie, what is less talked about is that Madonna was also offered to play Helena, but turned it down. When the star of ""Swept Away"", ""The Next Best Thing"" and ""Shanghai Surprise"" turns the movie down, you know you have a dud."

It's a bit cheesier than the first but there are some genuine laughs to be had.

If you're a fan of the first one you should definitely watch this one and see if you like it. Apparently some people hated it , but I think a lot of that comes from a persons expectations going into this. The first movie was touching and had some great life pointers. This one is something to watch for a good time and to see (most) of the characters you love from the first again. Only true negative I could throw out there is Bruno Kirby not returning for whatever reason. Jon Lovits is a funny addition to the team though.

It stars Sylvester Stallone, John Lithgow, Michael Rooker, and Janine Turner. Excellent acting and outstanding special effects really bring out the excellence in this film. Intensity and sheer terror really bring out the thrills in this film.

Sylvester Stallone is the perfect action-rescuer guy, John Lithgow is the perfect bad guy that uses guns, fiery explosives, and extreme violence to win the thing he desperately craves. I'M NOT GIVING ANYTHING AWAY! I strongly recommend that NOBODY under the age of 14 see this film. It's violence level is on the heavy scale and the language is on the extreme scale and it's terror is on the terrifying scale. There is a lot of blood and gunshots in this movie. There was a lot of 'F' words and 'motherf***er' works too. And the terror...terrifying.

This movie has non-stop action from it's frightening beginning to it's explosive conclusion. It's conclusion is explosive, but very short and very mediocre. Well, I mean the ending is literally explosive, if you know what I mean. The director could have done more with the ending. But otherwise, this movie is filled with violence and terror and fiery explosives that makes this one of the best action-adventure-thrillers ever made.

I was expecting a light comedy but what I got was a whole lot more. Following a similar plot to the skit, Coneheads is the story about the Beldar Conehead family who crash on earth during a scouting mission for planet conquest. While here, they dodge the INS, have a child and discover that life on Earth is quite good.

This is where the movie shows its heart. It could have been a movie of comedy bits but by the end, it is about happiness in a stable family, which is quite refreshing in these days of depressing movies about divorces and unmarried couples. It is nice to see Beldar be a father figure to his daughter rather than the ""Let Your Kids Be Who They Are"" mentality of these days. The direction of the film in excellent, setting up many nice visual gags and shots that are very impressive for a comedy film. And at times, the film feels ""epic"" as you see the family on the run from the INS, to moving to the suburbs to returning to their planet.

There are great performances throughout the film and the many cameos are perfect. Look for funny scenes from Jan Hooks, Adam Sandler, Michael Richards, and Garrett Morris. Michelle Burke makes a nice debut as Connie Conehead and I expect to see more of her in the future.

On the surface, this seems like a dumb movie and it has received many poor reviews. But if you sit back and let it take you on an adventure (and if you can keep up with the way the Coneheads use different words for common items) you will be pleasantly surprised."

When John Spartan (Sylvester Stallone) utters that line about half way through this film, it really symbolizes (unfortunately) the kind of tone ""Demolition Man"" takes.

For a brief plot synopsis, ""Demolition Man"" begins in Los Angeles circa 1996, where policeman John Spartan is trying to corral wacko criminal Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes). Long story short, they both end up incarcerated and flash-frozen in hopes of psychological parole 40 years into the future. When that time comes, Phoenix escapes and begins to wreak havoc on a benevolent civilization that is now not capable of handling such violence. Thus, Spartan is taken ""out of the fridge"" to try and stop Phoenix by all means necessary.

Now, here is the problem with this film: Imagine the plot of a great science fiction tale (like, say, Minority Report) done in a tone like the 1960s Batman television show...pure ""camp"". At its core, this movie isn't all that bad at all, featuring a very intriguing plot, interesting characters, plenty of action, and some legitimately funny comedy. Unfortunately, the entire film was played for purely ""camp"", thus leading to groan-inducing one-liners, characters that start off interesting and quickly turn one-dimensional, and a plot that kind of meanders around without ever really delving into the interesting issues (what cryostasis is like, how the future became what it is like, morality, etc.).

Don't get me wrong...this is a fun little movie to watch. But, once again, to use the Batman analogy, who is considered the ""real"" Joker: the puffed-out Caesar Romero of TV fame, or the dark, gritty Heath Ledger of Christopher Nolan's silver screen adaptation? I thought so. Had ""Demolition Man"" taken itself a bit more seriously, it could have risen that critical notch from novelty ""eh"" to ""hey, that was a good film""."

Drawbacks aside, it does offer some hauntingly beautiful color cinematography of Welsh landscapes, day and night, blazing with beauty, some quaint village shots of pubs and lodgings that look invitingly cosy, and some sketchy characterizations that do little more than pad out a rather tedious little tale.

HUGH GRANT does another one of his befuddled, amused, eyebrow lifting characterizations, complete with stutter and smile and pause between words, a role he seemed destined to repeat again and again. But he fits the role and the story--which takes place in 1917 Wales.

The jaunty musical score compensates for some slow moments but all the actors do a competent job of keeping things on a realistic level. There are no big names in the cast aside from Grant, but they all make their mark while he gets most of the footage for a rather awkward romance with a local girl who spends the night on the mountain with him.

Summing up: Not much in the way of a plot, but it manages to be appealing and extremely well photographed."

In fact, this film was probably the (unacknowledged) inspiration for the entire 'X-Files' series (which I hate), and there are a hell of a lot of similarities between them. The spooky, dark atmosphere of dread is very much the same though much more effective here. Duchovney's character--a liberal writer--does everything he can to accomodate and relate to the Pitt character (Early) and still ends up in deep trouble. The characters are all realistic and almost everything that happens is believable (as opposed to 'Blood Simple' where to achieve a few sick laughs you're asked to suspend disbelief). Pitt's performance is effective on its face as well as hilariously camp simply because of the huge star he has become since (his tongue-in-the-nudie-picture scene in the unrated version is funnier than hell). But all that's okay, for the film as a whole works on many levels and can withstand more than a few unintentional laughs to go with the intentional ones. The most touching scene is the final one, when the tape recording of Adele confessing her loneliness and deep need to be accepted humanizes her tragically and emphasizes the contrast between her (who never really had a chance) and these two yuppies (Duchovney and Forbes) who shared a portion of her tragic journey. Even after a first hand experience of true evil has tempered his liberalism and made him kill to save his life, he will have to hold on to a large portion of his original theory simply because of the overwhelming pathos generated by that final tape message."

I was not a big admirer of her ""Angel At My Table"", which had enormous possibilities but was suffocated under the filmmaker's penchant for what I refer to as 'ugly beauty'. Even the beautiful passages in this film are undermined by either something ghastly, something about to become ghastly, or something borne from ghastliness. A New Zealand woman in the 1800s becomes a mail-order bride for an uninterested working man; she's a self-elected mute and communicates through her wizened little daughter (Oscar-winner Anna Pacquin, a bit over-the-top) and through her passion for playing the piano, which becomes a point of contention in her marriage. Engrossing human drama with a torrid undercurrent of sexuality and violence. Many people I've talked to about this film could not get with it, but perhaps that's the fault of watching movies at home. In the theater, this was a slightly-dazed, rapturous and enveloping brew that held me spellbound until the lights went up. Movies like this don't hold the same spell when butchered up by ads for the CBS comedies. Holly Hunter, Sam Neill and, most especially, Harvey Keitel all do terrific work.

At one point his character says ""All I could think about was feed the hole, feed the hole..."" That hole represents his own private Hell, one that he created and he is perpetuating - but as long as things are going smoothly, if badly, things are OK.

One great, great scene is where Oldman casually sets his gun down on the kitchen table and Sciorra - sadly, in too small a role - picks it up and points it at him. The look on his face is priceless.

This movie has the same ethos as ""Bad Lieutenant"", but doesn't have that movie's crushing, personally wretched banality. It's also not quite as shocking or intense. Instead, it uses its main character's arrogance and sadistic tendencies as ""fatal flaws"" which ultimately help to bring down an otherwise quasi-noble guy.

I liked this movie up to a point, but sometimes it feels like I'm being manipulated - shown something shocking just for the sake of it being shocking. Like the scene with Olin and Oldman in the car that is excerpted at the beginning. A lot of that is just unnecessary. It's supposed to help set the tone, but by this time the tone has already been set - these are both desperate characters with a lot to lose and little to gain."

The movie, considering what you would take to be it's target audience (pre-teens), is pretty dark. Colin is dying, his mother died, Mary's parents die...yeah. For what it is, it's great. The acting is superb, the plot is engaging, and the Secret Gardner itself is astounding. The movie is full of secrets, and characters with secrets. Pretty much all the main characters have had some sort of tragedy in their lives.

It's one of those movies that you want to watch again. It's not exceptionally funny, although there are dashes of humor. Not that romance, but there is some.

I'm kind of upset this movie isn't on the bottom 100; it deserves a spot at least number 60 or 70 on that list. This isn't just a film I think is bad in a campy-fun sort of MST3K way; it's just bad. This is one of the few films that I really, really HATE. Freddy Got Fingered is in the same category of bad.

So the story in this one goes that the daughter (Gugino) goes to California to go to school and comes back with Crawl (Shore) and he tries to learn to be a farmer. Then the boyfriend tries to set Shore up so that the girl will leave Crawl and go back to him. It ends and what's left of the audience can leave.

The main purpose of this movie is for Pauly Shore to mug for the camera and try to be funny; but I'd say about 100% of the time he fails at that. Their horrible inaccurate and out of date view of farms and farming is offensive and there's nothing in this movie worth seeing. If you think of seeing it: don't.

Everything about it is magnificent. The music goes perfect with the scenes and mood of the film, and the characters have personalities that go with the flow of the movie. Every event leads to another one and keeps you watching. I cant even describe the overall feeling after you watch it. It will make you feel every emotion there is. There are parts where you will be angry at the movie, but another when u are happy and over joyed and yet, sad and crying your eyes out.

The old story of a young girl finding the true beauty within from a beast is captured very well. It can be told anyway but Disney really makes it the best. The animation is still beautiful even now when they have higher technology. Overall even know it is still my favorite movie and i do watch it every time i get a chance. I am practically obsessed it is so good. I do have other favorites like the little mermaid and Tarzan and the lion king but nothing can compare to this.

Every time i see it i am taken away into it until the end. I always wish that this story could somehow come true and i could be there. It makes you dream and wish and hope. The strong scenes for me are: -when the prince is just transformed into the beast and with the rose as the camera zooms away from the castle. -after Gaston proposes to belle and she runs out of the house asking for a more ""provincial life"" and lays in the grass -the library scene -and definitely the ballroom scene just fills me with joy and tears at the same time -and lastly when the beast is dying and belle mutters that she loves him

What really makes it the best is the voices too. Just listening to hte music without the movie can make you feel the same way.

I admit to knowing nothing about it's director and a complete lack of familiarity with most of it's actors or the mythology behind it's production (I was born years after it was made). I can, however, safely say this: this is one of the greatest movies ever made. Every aspect of the film is flawless, from the acting to the cinematography to the script.

This is also the most truly macho of all macho movies. It's not cartoonish machismo, rather it's the kind of machismo you see in drywall hangers: no-nonsense comments like ""We're after men"" and ""Let's go"" predominate, the men don't swagger around and violence is approached (fairly) honestly. The reserved dialogue and physicality reminds me of ""Seven Samaurai"" (to which this film owes a great deal). To me, that is the highest praise that I can give a movie.

The photography is amazing: the desert looks sweltering and parched, the close-ups of actor's faces outdoes Sergio Leone and the action is probably the best ever filmed. Scorcese and Tarantino obviously owe a lot to Peckinpaw. The scene during the opening credits of ""Reservoir Dogs"" is a direct lift from this movie, just to cite one of countless examples.

The acting is on par with the direction. Robert Ryan steals the show and, c'mon, who doesn't love Ernest?

Some would poo-poo the films treatment of women, and I am not going to get involved in that debate. Just go see it because, like the best movies, it immerses you in a time and place. Smell the sage!"

But Bloodline is just a total muddled, disjointed mess due to extreme studio interference that has virtually nothing going for it.

Due to the availability of leaked workprints, we now have a fairly good rough cut of what the film was supposed to be like, using workprints and original footage.

It's much longer, and is 100% more cohesive and narratively makes a lot more sense, and features some super cool practical effects, and differences in some existing key scenes, that were abandoned.

It seems the studio thought horror fans are braindead and care nothing about plot or structure as long as there's plenty of gore.

The end result is just that - a dismal film that offers absolutely nothing apart from some OK effects, but even then it's nothing as good as in Hellraiser or Hellraiser 2.

It's especially infuriating when we know there was a far, far superior version of the film that existed before the studio cut it to ribbons."

The police arrest him and presume that he's guilty. In the blue corner, we have defence lawyer Martin Vail (Richard Gere) who doesn't believe that Aaron is guilty and therefore he decides to represent him - he does this free of charge knowing that Aaron doesn't have the means to be able to pay him. In the red corner, we have prosecution lawyer Janet Venable (Laura Linney) who is a former colleague and former lover of Martin Vail. Both Vail and Venable set about in their defence and prosecution against Aaron, but who will end up prevailing?

This really was a film of two halves; I thought the first half of this film was fairly generic, someone is killed, they catch the person who they think has done it, that person protests their innocence. It's familiar territory and it had me thinking that it was just going to be a fairly standard legal thriller which wouldn't have been a bad thing, but merely would have just made it an 'average film'. It is in the second half of this film when things really pick up when certain 'discoveries' are made. The second half of the film is much more interesting, exciting, and engaging and when Vail makes this 'discovery' about his client it becomes both a blessing and a curse for Vali in the context of defending Aaron. The second half of the film focuses more on the courtroom battle and like A Few Good Men, Philadelphia, and The Lincoln Lawyer the court room scenes are well executed and fairly engaging.

Then we come to the acting and first we must start with Ed Norton; I couldn't believe that this was his debut motion picture - his performance was absolutely incredible. He's always been good in what's he's been in since, but I actually think his debut performance is one of his strongest. Gere was fairly good in a sort of sleazy and charming type way which is fairly standard for him. Linney also put in a good performance.

There were some minor problems with this film such as Vail's desire to represent Aaron (which is never really explained). I also could have done without some of the soppy moments between Vail and Venable which were cringe worthy and a bit pointless. Having said that, it's still worth watching and whilst it isn't the best legal thriller I've seen, it's still well above average."

Del is closing in on 50 years-old, but was surely stunning back in the day. She's left to making a living at a small-time tavern with romantic options limited to a garrulous alcoholic and a quiet mama's boy.

Obviously, this is not a flick for people who require an explosion every ten minutes to keep their attention (not that there's anything wrong with that, lol). It's a mundane drama about regular people and the social dynamics thereof - their (boring) daily lives, hopes, fears, regrets, grievances and lamentations. In part, it's about people who have been caged so long they no longer know how to be free. It's similar in tone to other 90's dramas like ""Sling Blade,"" which came out the next year, and ""Limbo"" (1999). While it lacks the survival element of the latter, does it really?

The frontman of The Pixies was approached to play the part of Victor, but he declined, saying he wasn't interested in playing such a character. Regardless, he would've fit the role.

The movie runs 1 hour, 44 minutes, and was shot in southeast New York at Barryville (Victor's house); five miles northeast of there in Highland Lake (the tavern); across the border of Barryville in Shohola, Pennsylvania (the bridge); and 80 miles northeast of that area in Hyde Park, NY, on the Huson River (Culinary Institute).

595,"Fan, The (1996)",16-Aug-1996,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,['Thriller']," Although The Fan has a baseball setting with the late Candlestick Park in San Francisco, it's not a baseball story. It's the dual story of a fan obsessed with baseball and his favorite player and that same player and his performance anxiety living up to the huge amount of money the Giants are paying him.

The title role is played by Robert DeNiro and a lot of his character is taken from what Michael Douglas had earlier did in Falling Down. DeNiro is the son of the founder of the company he works for, but dad having passed away long ago, the company is in different hands. DeNiro is not cutting it as a salesman of hunting knives (no pun intended) and he's having problems with his former wife Patty D'Arbanville-Quinn over visitation with his son.

At the same time multi-million dollar acquisition Wesley Snipes is having problems living up to the hype and he's looking like a big old bust. Especially next to new Giant sensation Benicio DelToro who is carrying the team with what looks like a Most Valuable Player season. Snipes is only doing well on one front, his relationship with his young son.

As his life falls apart DeNiro starts fixating on his favorite player and what he can do to help motivate him. After that this film gets truly bizarre.

But DeNiro who probably has more disturbed characters under his creative belt than any other actor around today keeps it all real. He's matched by Wesley Snipes who plays a Barry Bonds like superstar who gets a good life lesson by the end of the film.

In fact Snipes realizes it before the film ends. As he quite realistically says, it's just a game, it's not like we're out there discovering a cure for cancer. The problem is that there are too many out there, fans like DeNiro in sports and in show business who get way too caught up in it.

Look also for nice performances by Ellen Barkin who has a sports phone-in show and John Leguizamo as Snipes's agent and the wisest guy he has around him."
596,"Hunchback of Notre Dame, The (1996)",21-Jun-1996,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['Animation', ""Children's"", 'Musical']"," It is one of the most spread messages that parents and teachers send to kids: beauty is only skin deep... And so is ugliness.

Disney already used this phrase only 5 years before making ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"". It was in ""Beauty and the Beast"", which was an adaptation of an old French tale. Coincidentally, the directors (Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise) are the same for both movies.

Here, Disney creators stay within the same culture, but they use a more mature and serious title instead: Victor Hugo's ""Notre Dame de Paris"". And that's where the danger was. How can you take a very serious, mature and dark story and make it suitable for young children? We can say, once we see the final product, that is a success, but it is far from being a masterpiece like ""Beauty"".

Some very serious themes remain from the original story. The characters (at least those who are portrayed on screen) are the same and they're very well pictured. Quasimodo, who is one of the best animated interpretations of physical ugliness since a very long time, never sends a doubt that he is one of the most gentle men of Paris. Gypsy dancer Esmeralda reveals her hot beauty without sinking into the too-sexy or the scandalous. Courageous captain Phoebus is nice too, as he shows himself as somebody who do the right thing instead of instinctively obeying to the orders.

Evidently, gypsy-hating judge Claude Frollo is here too, but as a much darker and creepier role than portrayed in the book. There isn't a single moment in the movie where Frollo isn't accompanied by darkness, rain, fire, or any other element which portrays evil. Sometimes, he is simply too much dark and terrifying to be cast in what is supposed to be a children's/family movie. In a sense, he recalls me Judge Doom in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"".

Such a movie wouldn't have been released by Disney if there weren't any comic stuff inserted. This time, the mood enhancers are the three gargoyles who accompany Quasimodo in his bell-tower. They mostly succeed in their laugh delivering mission, but they often say ridiculous lines, such as ""You're human, with the flesh, and the hair, and the navel lint."" and act in ridiculous situations, such as a poker game which is an excuse for a freewheeling love song.

Talking about the songs, they're not astonishing. They're often located in the wrong moments and the soundtrack won't get any Billboard hit. It's a serious downfall after the success of songs belonging to previous movies. In ""Little Mermaid"", there's ""Under the Sea"". In ""Beauty and the Beast"", there's ""Be my Guest"". In ""Aladdin"", there's ""A Whole New World"". In ""The Lion King"", there are ""Circle of Life"" and ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" (thanks Elton). In ""Pocahontas"", there's ""Colours of the Winds"". In ""The Hunchback"", there is... That's the point: there's nothing.

Animation is good, but not everywhere. The city of Paris lacks of a magic touch, but Notre Dame is superb. The basilica is drawn on a monumental scale and becomes a divine entity, with the help of some quotes, particularly from Phoebus' part. The Gothic architecture and the windows are a feast for the eyes. Fire effects are also remarkable.

""The Hunchback of the Notre Dame"" is not a disaster, but it's a sign that Disney has jumped the shark. That's what happens when you run out of fairy tales or children's books in order to get a storyline. But the message is here and children should have lessons to learn here."
597,Eraser (1996),21-Jun-1996,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"['Action', 'Thriller']"," True Lies is often considered to be the last good/great Arnold Schwarzenegger action film. That is because Eraser it seems (at least to me before actually viewing the film), just did not see the amount of success that Arnold's previous action films achieved. Eraser was released in 1996 and had a troubled production where, if it was not for Schwarzenegger, this film would not have been released. The film was directed by Chuck Russell (The Mask, A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors, The Scorpion King) and stars (obviously) Arnold Schwarzenegger (The Terminator, Total Recall, and Terminator 2: Judgment Day). The film was a box office hit but was not as well received as Arnold's previous films. But that is not to say that this film has it's fans as I have seen a following for this film.

John Kruger is a US Marshall and works as a person who helps protect witnesses. One particular assignment sees Kruger protecting a woman who has information on a company who are developing high tech weapons that are being sold to the wrong people. It is up to Kruger not only to protect the witness, but to make sure these weapons do not get into the wrong hands.

Let's be real here, Eraser is nowhere close to being Arnold's best. Yet, it is far from being his worst. Eraser, for me, was better than I was expecting for the most part. It reminds me of a Dolph Lundgren film released in 2001 called Hidden Agenda. Just imagine this film, hardly any action and fun, and no high tech weaponry. I was surprised that this film was pretty high tech with the whole ""rail gun"" being the main focus. I find it too high tech because if you take it out of the film, the film itself is pretty realistic (for an action movie at least). This high tech weapon takes out any sense of realism. Yet, the weapon itself is pretty unique. The weapon has it's own logical issues, but that is action movie logic for you (and don't take that as me defending it). The special effects are, let's say dated. Completely CG and not always convincing. Mostly used with the firing of the ""rail gun weapon and a few of the bigger action scenes. Otherwise, I do not have a huge problem with it but considering that this is a point in film history that CG is being used and used fairly well, I would expect a little more from this film. Speaking of the action, the action here is fairly good. There are some scenes here that are just plain fun, something that should be present in any good Schwarzenegger action film. We get maybe one big action scene and the rest are fun little action scenes mostly consisting of shootouts and an explosion here and there. Aside from the action, the film has some good comedic moments and we get the usual Arnold one liners. Though when none of that is present on screen, the film feels pretty generic and that is the overall feel for this film. Arnold is still on his up and up in his role of John Kruger. Arnold does give us a good performance and plays the protector character fairly well. You feel safe when around this character. Vanessa Williams plays the woman being protected and she does fine as well and plays a female character capable of holding her own. The story overall takes a little bit to get interesting and when a nice twist is revealed, the film gets a little bit interesting. Again, the film does not do much by itself to be entirely interesting without the help of action and comedy. I should note that this film's cinematographer, did cinematography for Terminator 2: Judgment Day and it is very apparent and looks amazing here with the lighting and the ability to give us viewers a good view of the action taking place. Lastly, Alan Silvestri does a good job with the music here. It is nice to hear it in the background while the action is taking place.

Eraser, overall, is just an OK film, despite my apparent overwhelming praise. It does not surpass some of Arnold's finest but it is still worth a watch as it does have it's moments."

Let me just add my voice to those who have praised this film as a very good romantic adventure of its time. It of course has one foot obviously placed squarely in WWII propaganda (Gary Cooper as the iconic romantic American hero), but it's also highly entertaining.

It's longer than it needs to be, and it's a bit talky, but it nevertheless doesn't drag. The highest praise must go to the art directors, who fashion an impressive set perched among some rocky mountains that feels extremely authentic. The color photography isn't as vibrant as other Technicolor products of the time, but that may be due to age. And there's a terrific lush score to go along with the action.

I've never been a huge fan of Ingrid Bergman, but she's not bad here. Gary Cooper is perfectly cast and is required to do little more than just be Gary Cooper, but it works. The most colorful performances come from Akim Tamiroff and, especially, Katina Paxinou as two members of the Spanish revolutionary group. Paxinou is a firecracker, giving an intense performance that dominates the screen whenever she's present.

A highly enjoyable Hollywood product from the war years.

They tell me this flick changed the way some things were done in the movie business. I am told by others that this one is one of the truly best of Hitchcock's, well worth checking out. I, nevertheless walked into this movie with an open mind. A mind that quickly got bored.

I did like the caught-up-in-the-mystery feeling that flashed through a few scenes. I did like the famous drawl of James Stewart, and his character's wit throughout. And I am now interested in reading some of Cornel Woolrich's short stories, from which this screenplay was created. But still, I was bored.

Leaving behind the ""importance"" of this movie and only commenting on how it affected me, I only give it a four out of ten. On my personal rating scale that's counted as ""not great, not horrible, don't bother."" See it if you must. It is, after all, one of the talked about films in certain circles. If you have not seen it and end up in one of those circles, rest assured that the person extolling it's genius is most likely paraphrasing a magazine article he or she read last night and is not too sure what they are supposed to think about this one."

Vincent Minelli directs this Garland starring vehicle & then marries her after the film. Arther Freed, the MGM musical genius produces it. The supporting cast is strong from character actors Marjorie Main & Chill Wills, to Mary Astor & even a 19 year old June Lockhart.

The story is basically about St. Louis & a family living there in 1903. During the first half hour Judy sings several songs. Then there is a musical break for a while before the songs come back as we go from summer to fall. Then in the winter in the last 15 minutes, Judy finally gets to that tune ""Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas."" Besides Over The Rainbow, this is her next most famous song.

This Technicolor musical is a good film. Some of the tunes are now dated, but Judys Christmas song is as timeless as any she ever sang & she is in excellent voice. The film features the mandatory happy ending which most films of the period have.

It runs a little short of 2 hours so it doesn't get bogged down which makes it quite watchable & even though it has Christmas in it, it is not broadcast as often as other Christmas films, but is as good as many of the films which are broadcast every year."

Pity poor Tracy: he suffers endless exasperation while preparing for his only daughter's wedding to a nice young man with a nice job and a nice family. What misfortune! Barely qualifies as a comedy of errors, since it focuses primarily on Tracy's upper middle class woes and whining (why won't anyone drink one of his martinis?). Maybe he was supposed to be a self-absorbed, semi-neurotic schmuck the audience can laugh at, but Minnelli doesn't pitch it in that direction, and Tracy certainly doesn't play it that way. Tracy bumbles through his frustrations, managing the occasional amusing quip or weary observation, but too often maintains his identifiably steadfast dignity to really be funny; the script navigates low-energy sitcom-level mishaps, but does manage a few humorous but predictable punchlines--you think that coat of his is going to rip? Bennett is the reasonable, supportive mother of the bride; Liz Taylor the soft and spoiled bride-to-be. Runs just over an hour-and-a-half but feels much longer.

None of its characters is without flaws - even the elusive Laura is too naive for her own good. They are presented lovingly by Preminger, and his award-winning DOP Joseph LaShelle.

The excellent script ranges from caustic Laedecker/Webb put-downs, through brutal Treadwell/Anderson self-assessment, to laconic MacPherson/Andrews minimalism.

The score is, of course, a classic. Raksin's sinuous melody, brilliantly deployed, haunts the picture as powerfully as Laura's portrait haunts Detective MacPherson.

The central performances are wonderful, not least because of the perfect casting. Tierney shines as the enigmatic title character: beautiful, intelligent, somehow both cool and passionate at the same time. Webb dazzles, Price slithers, Anderson simmers. Best of all is Andrews as the detective who barely opens his mouth when he speaks, and on whose face desire barely flickers - but he does enough to show you exactly what he wants and how he feels. It's a great movie performance from an underrated actor. Only Dorothy Adams doesn't quite fit, in a role - Laura's maid - that could easily have been as showy as the others with the right performer.

LAURA doesn't appear to be about anything significant, but it leaves behind it a feeling that it is greater than the sum of its parts. I don't know how this was managed, and perhaps no-one involved in it did either. It's one of those movies where everything just clicked. Seeing it again recently, after many years, confirms its status for me as a significant work, but exactly why or how remains as much of a puzzle as Laura herself."
612,Lost Horizon (1937),01-Jan-1937,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," What a masterful film, filled with adventure, memorable characters, and a story that is profoundly thoughtful. During a tumultuous revolt in China, a party of Westerners, including an important British diplomat named Robert Conway (Ronald Colman), escapes by airplane, flying west through the high mountains of Asia. In this no-mans land, disaster strikes. But beyond, a peaceful kingdom called Shangri-la awaits the party, led by their guide, the wise and purposeful Chang (Oscar-nominated H.B. Warner). Much of the plot takes place in this beautiful and serene place.

In Shangri-la, doctors are not needed, there is no crime, residents are content and happy. And people age very slowly, as a result of ""the absence of struggle"". Despite the forbidding mountains and their harsh weather that surround Shangri-la, this isolated paradise contains lush vegetation, useful minerals, a picturesque waterfall, birds and other wildlife.

Most characters are appealing. I like the wise and patient Mr. Chang. The High Lama (Sam Jaffe) exudes peace and wisdom. The George character is annoying, but serves a purpose as the representative of conventional humanity. There are many lines of thoughtful dialogue. One of my favorites is a quote from Chang who talks to Conway about aging. Says Chang in a non-judgmental and soft voice: ""You know, each time you Westerners celebrate your birthdays, you build another fence around your minds"".

B&W visuals are grainy. Lighting ranges from evocative to bad. In the outdoor adventure scenes, there are lots of interesting long shots. Sets make use of painted backdrops and miniatures. And the special effects are terrific for the era. Background music is intermittent and ranges from nondescript in early segments to ethereal in Shangra-la. Acting is adequate.

Though the film tells a great outdoor adventure story, the real value of ""Lost Horizon"" lies in its deep spiritual themes, as expressed by Chang and the High Lama. Rarely does a film exude such wisdom. And it is mostly for this reason that, despite imperfect visuals, the film ranks among my all-time favorites."
613,My Man Godfrey (1936),01-Jan-1936,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Comedy']," Of course the deck is slightly stacked in this story of a bum unexpectedly entering a ""stinking rich"" family. It is fairly rapidly revealed that the bum was not really one, that he comes from mostly the same old money background as the family itself, and that this accounts for his immediate ability to find his way around with the Bullocks, he has got at his disposal all the required codes and keys enabling him to wrap them all around his finger. Beyond its well-meaning fairy tale conclusion - the poor being given a job and getting richer or at least a less precarious life, while the spoiled rich will not have to endure poverty, though they might have rather deserved it through their brainlessness - the film is not deep down a socially-conscious comedy, such as some of Capra's most well-known pictures or Sullivan's Travels from Preston Sturges. It is rather the epitome of the screwball genre. Which means that, though it does incorporate a fair amount of nuttiness occasionally verging on the absurd, it also relies first and mainly on a rigorous system of cogs and wheels well-controlled by the screenwriters and the director. The disguise motive has provided some of the best comedies on stage, such as Shakespeare's Twelfth Night or the very subtle comedies from XVIIIth century French playwright Marivaux, so it is not surprising that it soon became a feature of some of the best comedies on screen as well. Here there is a double level of travesty : the butler is a former bum, but actually the bum was himself a former millionaire, so it actually works on three levels. And as often in such stories the comical effect is based on an inversion of normal relations, Godfrey the servant becoming in some way the master of the clueless Bullock family. There are much darker variations on a similar theme, such as The Servant by Joseph Losey or earlier on Miss Julie by Ibsen. Nothing remotely as dark as that here. Godfrey is a broadly benevolent and selfless influence, though his relations with Irene prove that he has no real idea on how to manage the various unexpected effects of his irruption in the dysfunctional Bullock household. He will not find the solution himself - Irene eventually will, which is a brilliant last twist of the story, the wise master has found his own master in the seemingly brainless young woman. Great conclusion. Does one really have to add that William Powell and Carole Lombard are shining bright and the rest of the cast is outstanding? Probably not."
614,Giant (1956),01-Jan-1956,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," This has recently played on Turner Classic Movies, and so they have been playing a short promo on the film. However, I disagree with the critics' assessment that this is a man versus woman film. Instead, this is a film about the pangs of old Texas giving birth to new Texas. Rock Hudson plays the young patriarch of a Texas ranching family, Bick Benedict, in the 1920s who goes to Maryland to buy a colt. He is instantly smitten with one of the daughters in the family (Elizabeth Taylor as Leslie) , in spite of the fact that she raises his Texas ire by saying things such as Texas was stolen from Mexico! Taylor's character is already spoken for, but she throws over her intended and she and Benedict marry on a whim.

Adjustment is hard for Leslie. The Benedict ranch is sprawling but devoid of Maryland's natural beauty. Bick's sister Luz runs the house and is not going to give that title up to some delicate East coast beauty. And when she tries to help the Mexican families that live on the ranch, she finds her husband angry with her. Ranch hand Jett Rink (James Dean in his last film role) falls madly in love with Leslie who just doesn't see it. Meanwhile Luz has always loved Jett, and that love later greatly complicates the Benedicts' lives in a very unconventional way.

Like I said, this is no man versus woman film. This is initially east coast liberal civilized values versus the rough and tumble values of what is still the Texas frontier in many ways. And it is the story of a family over 30 years as Texas changes in its values and what is important in its industry. For example, cattle ranching gives way in importance to the petroleum industry. As for changing values, Bick changes from a man who really doesn't see the Hispanics as human beings to somebody who literally takes a beating to defend the honor of one decades later.

Highly recommended as a film and as a showcase for the talents of Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor, and James Dean. Dean had other good showcases for his talent, but I feel Hudson and Taylor - in spite of her two Best Actress Oscars are both remembered too much for their soapy roles and not enough for their acting skills. Highly recommended."

Playing fast and loose somewhat with John Buchan's (1916) novel, Hitchcock nevertheless directs a fast-moving, riveting story of political intrigue and paranoia with some truly hair-raising scenes (the Forth rail bridge scene springs to mind).

Hitchcock makes his usual cameo appearances. Apart from the one noted here, he's also in one of the early scenes after Arabella Smith fires the pistol. The music hall audience panics and make for the egress, 'Hitch' being one of the crowd. He's also one of the detectives seeking Hannay after he leaves the train on the Forth bridge.

There are some really sparkling lines of dialogue: cold, hungry and tired after tramping across the moors in (what I suppose is Fife), Hannay encounters a crofter (played by John Laurie, later famous as Fraser in Dad's Army): Crofter (to Hannay who has asked him for a bed for the night): Can you sleep in a box bed?"" Hannay: ""I can try"" Crofter: ""Can you eat the herring?"" Hannay: ""I could eat half a dozen right now"".

Once inside, the crofter's (much younger) wife asks Hannay the following, after hearing that he lives in London: ""Is it true that the women in London are beautiful?"" Hannay: ""Some of them are but they wouldn't be if they stood next to you."" My word, what a charmer!

In case you were wondering, the thirty-nine steps in the original book referred to the steps down to the sea at a secluded bay, the spy involved arranging to be extracted by a submarine when the tide had covered up to the thirty-ninth step from the top. This is not alluded to in the 1935 film version, other than to give a name to the network of spies involved. Hannay was a mining engineer and Arabella Smith in the book is a man! It's a short-ish film too, coming in at about an hour and a quarter. It's occasionally on British terrestrial telly and never fails to please. Why they tried to remake this (in 1953 and 1978) is anyone's guess as you can't improve on perfection."

From then on Zombies remained a firm staple of terror B-genre , bringing the dead back to life was a popular pastime in the 30s and 40s. The early zombies were basically genteel beings and generally likable and agreeable types. Romero created in Pittsburg his own production company Image Ten Productions with his friends, John Russo among them and they each contributed 10.000 dollars and formed the budget for his first movie which made Romero world famous. George A. Romero cast an African-American Duane Jones, unusual by the time.When Romero directed this claustrophobic picture , he gave birth to the modern Zombie genre and the film has had a lasting importance, giving interesting consideration to the violence executed by the zombies. It was initially dismissed as exploitation, but when was re-released , it struck deeply with a disillusioned youth angry with the desperation about Vietnam. It was one of the first successful independent terror productions influencing and inspiring countless imitations, copies and rip-offs. Followed by three equally cellebrated sequels, ¬®Dawn of the dead(78)¬®where the zombies attack a shopping mall ,¬®Day of the dead dead(85)¬® about flesh-eating zombies taking over the world and scientific experimenting on zombies and ¬®Land of dead(2005)¬® with high budget played by Simon Baker,Asia Argento and Dennis Hooper. And also an inferior remake in 1990 by Tom Savini with Tone Todd(Duane Jones's role) in which again a bunch of people are pursued by ghouls Zombies ."

618,Picnic (1955),01-Jan-1955,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," A macho drifter (William Holden) sidles into a small town in Nowheresville, U.S.A. and the local womenfolk, who all apparently think that their menfolk aren't up to snuff, drool all over him like he's a stripper at a bachelorette party. Not much else happens in this wanna-be sultry film based on the William Inge play.

The 1950s were a big decade for big movies based on big plays. Unfortunately, every film maker was under so much pressure to tone down whatever it was that made the play big in the first place, that the movies based on them seem all too often like a big to-do over mighty little. ""Picnic"" is nearly plot less; the only suspense comes in wondering if Kim Novak is going to ditch her dull home town and take off with her hunk of man.

Holden was a good actor, but he gives a silly performance here. The script and the direction push too hard the fact that we're supposed to be overwhelmed by his virility---which is a shame, because that was one of Holden's most striking attributes when he was allowed to act more naturally. His furry chest was up there with some of the most famous chests in screen history, yet they had him shave it for this film so that he would look younger. He instead resorts to ripping off his shirt every so often like the Scottish janitor from the Simpsons.

Kim Novak, on the other hand, was never really a good actress, and this movie didn't change my mind. Talk about famous chests---holy cow, she could poke eyes out with those things! The BIG moment between her and Holden comes when they dance at a town social, if dance is quite the right word. If you've seen Elaine on ""Seinfeld"" dance, you will have a pretty good indication of what these two look like.

The best performance in the film comes from Rosalind Russell, who plays the sexually frustrated town shrew, married to the town drunk (Arthur O'Connell). She's able to convey the desperation felt by a woman slowly wasting away in a forgotten corner of the American heartland and illustrates exactly what Novak's character is afraid of becoming.

I know I'm being pretty hard on this movie, but actually I did enjoy it. It's really nothing special, so don't go out of your way to see it, but it is fun to make fun of all the cornball 50s trappings.

Gene Hackman, a staple of Grisham movies, is very good and most likely the saving grace. He plays a white supremacist bomber who is set to be executed because he supposedly blew up a one-armed Jewish lawyer and his two twin girls. Chris O'Donnell is Hackman's grandson who becomes his lawyer in an desperate attempt to save his life. I would say that O'Donnell's acting is adequate but not exceptional. Fay Dunaway plays Hackman's aged daughter and turns in a fine showing. The plot is well constructed but it leaves you wondering was justice really done? I feel the answer is the all too usual yes and no. On one hand the guilty were punished and yet no one is satisfied with the outcome which I suppose is true of most real life situations. Hackman's character is as bad as an apple that's been lying on the ground for three weeks but he at times does resemble an actual human being with real feelings and emotions. His character isn't sorry about anything he's done but is his own man. He assumes responsibility for his sins while detesting those who used him for their own ends and it shows when he angrily confronts his old comrade-in-arms who pays him a stupidly ill-advised visit in prison. O'Donnell's character does love Hackman in spite of Hackman's repeated abuse of him and tries everything possible to defend him from final judgment. I can't say I loved this film it was not a wasted experience just not a pleasant one due to the subject material but you can't be happy everyday."

Interestingly, during this era the film was made there were a lot of movies which came out with this kind of theme, of a losing team where someone or something helps that team become a winning team. The most memorable film of that category is probably ""Space Jam"" which came out a couple of years later, and I heard it is still the highest grossing basketball movie.

This movie is probably the first movie we are familiar with that the famous actor Joseph Gordon Levitt. He has come a long way since then, and has become like every girls dream. I wonder what happened to the other kid, J.P.? I haven't heard any clear answers. Joseph Gordon Levitt would much later star in a movie with Tony Danza, they even talked a little about this movie in their interviews, but I wish he'd talk more about what it was like working in this movie.

I recently saw this movie on my parents old VHS tape, and while I remember it pretty well since I was a kid, it mostly just seemed like a cheesy movie and a waste of time. Some of the movie seems serious, I mean it's a movie that involves foster kids, and some of the scenes that don't involve baseball or angels are a little serious. But, the movie seems incredibly cheesy and too focused on an individual character. I mean the movie involves a losing baseball team with a manager George Knox played by Danny Glover who can't take always being on a losing team. Then, we have a couple of boys Roger and J.P. who are in a foster home. As we'd see from the trailer, Roger asks his Dad, ""When Are We Going To Be A Family Again."" The father replies, ""The Way I See It, I'd Say When The Angels Win The Pennant."" Now looking at that movie from an adult perspective, it sounds like a sarcastic remark, like why would you believe it? But, Roger takes his fathers words literally and prays for the California Angels in a somewhat funny prayer. The Angels start to help out the California Angels, and that is the main plot of the movie, which is obviously the title.

Let me tell you, while this movie might have wanted to leave a good message of believing in God and miracles, it doesn't do it in a religious way. I mean the angels are lead by Al the boss angel played by Christopher Lloyd. We only see the angels at the ball park, except in one scene. Every scene the angels are in, are cheesy scenes and they do not seem like they are holy, they mostly seem there for comic relief for a film with a somewhat serious tone in some scenes. I mean, it's interesting to think that angels would help a losing team become a winning team with the most bizarre methods. But, the angels weren't in the more serious scenes where what Roger really wanted was his father back. Also, how a prayer would be answered about a losing baseball team becoming a winning baseball team, but not about all the other problems in the world, almost making Roger's problems seem like they're at the center of the universe.

I give this movie credit, it still is somewhat inspirational. But, I wouldn't say the movie is too exciting or too fast paced. I'd say it is mostly just a cheesy movie about angels helping a baseball team win so a boy could get his father back, and again the angels weren't holy.

This movie's message, isn't as inspirational as a more recent movie about the surfer, Bethany Hamilton, ""Soul Surfer."" That movie was truly inspirational, and not in a cheesy way. It also isn't as inspirational as a recent religious movie about a boy who sees heaven, ""Heaven Is For Real."" So, I'm sure everybody who sees this ""Angels In The Outfield,"" could agree that the angels didn't seem holy, and were mostly cheesy. I don't really remember laughing at this movie except in a couple of scenes.

What else I want to say, is I've recently seen another kids movie of a losing team becoming a winning team called ""Underdog Kids."" While that movie was pretty cheesy, I actually enjoyed it somewhat, because I felt like that movie left some really good messages, and probably better messages than ""Angels In The Outfield"" when ""Underdog Kids"" doesn't talk about angels. So, I'd recommend that movie.

Also, the funniest book I've read IN MY ENTIRE LIFE is a book around the same age as ""Angels In The Outfield"" called ""The Toilet Paper Tigers,"" a 1993 book by Gordon Korman. The book is about a low budget little league team of misfits, and a coach who doesn't know how to coach baseball. But, the coach's niece the same age as the boys finds ways to annoy the boys into making them become a winning team. Some of the boys secretly like her. That book would seem to make a better movie than ""Angels In The Outfield,"" of course if it had the right director. It seems like a better story and more exciting. I'd definitely recommend that book.

""Angels In The Outfield,"" entertains me somewhat, but I wouldn't recommend it. I feel like this movie has too much emphasis on angels helping a losing team in cheesy ways, and a boy in a foster home in mostly ways that aren't inspiring, losing the movie's entertaining factor. Watch another Disney movie the same age as this instead, ""Blank Check."" I feel like that one is way more entertaining. I give Angels In The Outfield A 6 for some entertainment, and a movie I enjoyed when I was a kid."

At the time they were still experimenting with and getting to know the Xerox system, allowing them to produce animation with a smaller budget, but with a noticeably rougher outlines and simpler character models. And it shows. The Sword in the Stone is one of the worst looking Disney films, there's really no way around it. But, it makes up for that, at least partially, with some catchy tunes from the Sherman Brothers, and with fun, memorable characters.

The story is basically that from T. H. Stone's novel of the same name. Merlin is a wizard who ages backwards in time - it's complicated - and he's the one who mentors Arthur Pendragon in his early days as a page in a distant, rural castle in the English countryside. That mentoring mostly consisting of him changing Arthur into various animals and watching as he almost gets eaten. Happy fun times for the whole family.

In all seriousness though, Merlin is a great character. Good lines, classic character design, the best song in the whole film and his various hijinks with Arthur's life do keep us entertained throughout the whole film.

What keeps this from being a greater Disney film is that the story itself doesn't really contain all that much and that the side characters are not that interesting. In the book we have knights, creatures of the forest, Robin Hood of all things, villagers, castle folk. None of which we see in this film. It's just Merlin, non-speaking animals and Arthur most of the time. It's kind of fun, but the book had potential for so much more. Imagine if they did King Arthur during the 90s, in the middle of Disney Renaissance. That would have been amazing. Just think about it.

In the end The Sword in the Stone is a perfectly good children's film with a more relaxed tone than was typical for a Disney film at the time. It's not bad, but it's unfortunately not great either."

The promotional stills and interviews looked promising, and I was expecting a high-spirited romp on par with Errol Flynn's celebrated film. Boy, was I in for a letdown.

The movie starts off thrillingly, with Michael Kamen's spectacular score playing over medieval illustrations. But as soon as the opening credits end, the film shows its true colors¬Öa dark, dank, gore-laden bore. Seriously, what Robin Hood movie worth its salt starts with a dismemberment scene? I couldn't even look at the screen for this sequence. Alas, it was only the beginning. We're later treated to a close-up of Robin slitting his hand open (and blood seeping thru his fingers) to swear revenge for his father, we see Will Scarlett take an arrow thru the hand, we see the Sheriff of Nottingham's witch slice her arm open and spit into her blood to make a prediction, we see a blood-filled egg cracked open in another scene, we see the Sheriff's face getting stitched up¬Öreally, how's a guy supposed to keep his popcorn down? How did this movie get away with a PG-13 rating? This is R-level stuff all the way. Of course, the movie's lack of color and light doesn't help much. I don't mind them foregoing the tights for this go-round, but why isn't Robin Hood wearing his signature Lincoln green? Why isn't Will Scarlett at least wearing SOMETHING red? Everybody's wearing browns and blacks, which makes the film monochromatic and dull. Sherwood Forest looks dirty and gloomy instead of inviting and exciting. The sets are so dark and shadowy that it's a miracle anyone can see where they're going. I'm sure John Graysmark and John Bloomfield did their best with the sets and costumes, but they would have been better served had they been colorful and well-lit. And the plot takes too much of the spirit out of the legend. Robin's such a sullen gloomy Gus that it's impossible to imagine the Merry Men taking him in, much less letting him lead them. Friar Tuck's reduced to a potbellied wimp (what happened to the swordsman who was more lethal than he looked?). Azeem, while a good character in his own right, really doesn't belong in the Robin Hood mythos. (He would have made a fine stand-alone character, though.) The witch has no business being in this film at all. And what purpose does it serve to make Will Scarlett Robin's traitorous half-brother? Director Kevin Reynolds tries to guide the movie with a swift and steady hand, but the film is such a dismal mess that he ultimately can't hold it together. It's so ponderous and serious that there's no sense of fun to be had. And hearing Kamen's glorious score accompanying the film makes the experience even worse. That music deserved to be in a much better movie, and it possesses the fun, exciting spirit that the movie itself utterly lacks.

And then there's the acting. You couldn't find a better Sheriff of Nottingham than Alan Rickman, and he literally steals the show. But that's not too hard when everyone else stinks. Morgan Freeman does his best with Azeem, but again, this character doesn't belong in the saga. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio doesn't have any spark as Marian, nor is she really beautiful enough to play the part (Olivia DeHavilland she ain't). Christian Slater can't make heads or tails of the tarnished Will. Brian Blessed is wasted as Robin's doomed dad, as is Michael Wincott as Guy of Gisbourne. Sean Connery's cameo as King Richard is fun, but pointless. The supporting players are so dull they aren't even worth mentioning. And Kevin Costner¬Ögreat actor, but a LOUSY Robin Hood. He has neither the presence or the attitude this character requires, and he's always talking in a droning monotone. In no way does he come off as an inspiring leader; he's more apt to put you to sleep. Nor does he have the physicality the role demands. I haven't seen a Robin Hood this inept since Barrie Ingham in A CHALLENGE FOR ROBIN HOOD. Yeah, Costner gets in a few good shots with an arrow, but when Robin thoroughly sucks at swordplay and can't even take the Sheriff without help from Azeem, you know the filmmakers have screwed up. Robin Hood's supposed to be the last dude on the planet you want to mess with, not a graceless klutz. Errol Flynn would have trashed the Sheriff and his witch with both hands tied behind his back. Heck, even Cary Elwes' MEN IN TIGHTS incarnation and Disney's cartoon fox Robin would have made short work of them. This Robin¬Öwell, had he been killed at the end of the movie, I doubt anyone would have really cared. He's hardly the sort of guy you want to root for.

Call me old-fashioned, but I don't like my swashbuckler epics to be gory, dark, and dismal exercises in tedium. I like them bright, colorful, exuberant, and fun¬Öwith a minimum of bloodletting. THE MASK OF ZORRO is a case in point, as are THE PRINCESS BRIDE, LORD OF THE RINGS and PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN. Compared to those films, PRINCE OF THIEVES falls horribly short. Compared to the Errol Flynn classic it so wants to topple, it's an even bigger failure. Maybe some day there'll be a good, modern Robin Hood movie that measures up to the Flynn version and truly revives the legend for a new generation. But for now, this film ain't it. Stick with the Flynn version."

Watching their mistake and the exorbitant price they pay for it, you feel their guilt and their subsequent victimization to the point of physical discomfort. You can't wait for the second act when the villains will be brought to justice and you'll feel just great about the whole thing. . .right?

Then you get the second act. It turns into a showcase for hot young over-actors who could learn a thing or two from their younger counterparts. DeNiro's character is the most compelling and the movie would have done better to involve him more, but because of the cursory examinations Ron Eldard and Billy Crudup (and the screenplay) provide their characters, you never fully believe DeNiro would do what he does. Brad Pitt and Dustin Hoffman try like heck to make their plotline ring true, while Jason Patric and Minnie Driver just sit there and whine as if the story itself provides the tension they lack.

Plotwise, the second half provides only one real moment wherein the wounds begin to heal, with the testimony of one of the villains. The rest of the act, the movie and Hoffman double plead their own case. They're innocent, but if they're guilty it's still OK. The nonsensical mafia subplot seems a weak device to tie up loose ends, and where does DeNiro come up with his ace in the hole anyway? Sloppy writing that leaves the viewer still licking the wounds of the first half."

Dustin Hoffman dressed up as a woman; Julie Andrews dressed up as a man. How fitting that the very next year Linda Hunt would win the first Oscar ever given for playing a member of the opposite sex.

""Victor Victoria"" is a solidly-crafted, old-fashioned musical that finds Andrews pretending to be a male female impersonator (got that?) so that she can hold a job in a nightclub in Depression-era Paris. James Garner is the man's man who begins to doubt his manliness when he finds himself having some strange feelings for this ""guy."" It's a very gay-friendly movie that's really squeaky clean, though it might have been racy at the time when homosexuality wasn't as accepted as it is now (if you want to call it ""accepted"" even now).

There are lots of production numbers, but this doesn't feel like a musical, as all of the numbers are presented in context of a show and they don't propel the plot or develop characters. Lesley Ann Warren is fairly obnoxious as a bawdy American, but Robert Preston steals the show as a fellow drag performer.

As far as Blake Edwards projects go, this is one of the strongest.

The bad news: it is way overlong; Edwards always was a terribly self-indulgent parodist, even on the Peter Gunn show; the big pie fight is excruciatingly mishandled; Curtis and Lemmon were told to ham it up and they do, and this gets painful sometimes; the story is silly and the finale unsatisfying.

The good news: Natalie Wood is beautiful and unforgettable and does marvelous. The camera work makes the sound-stage ""exteriors"" come alive, without ever hiding the fact that they are in a sound-stage (they're intended to look phony). The story does have an oddly epic feel to it which is why it remains watchable despite its length and occasionally unfunny sequences.

The film is of course really of the 1960s genre ""camp"". Nobody's ever adequately explained the appearance of this genre; the silent films Blake is spoofing here were brilliantly spoofed in their own day by much brighter comic minds like Keaton and Chaplin, so it's not clear why anybody in the '60s thought they needed to be spoofed again. After all, ""The Perils of Pauline"" is from the same era that gave us Von Stroheim's brutally realistic ""Greed""; did movie-makers of the '60s really think they were so much more ""mature"" and ""sophisticated"" than Eric Von Stroheim? If not, then why pretend that the silent film era was somehow an age of ""innocence"" that we had ""gone beyond""? '60s camp is, in the last analysis, a collective monument to generational arrogance, nothing more; but I suppose, since this arrogance is a recurring problem in Modern culture, we need reminders that one generation's arrogance is another's fodder for parody."

I'm bemused by all the comments here about the good script, good acting, etc because I experienced the exact opposite. The acting was appalling, especially Forest Whitaker and Jaye Davidson; Whitaker's English accent made Dick Van Dyke's Mary Poppins accent look good. It was all over the place, varying from Cockney to Australian to Texan American in one sentence. He was obviously concentrating on the accent as his acting was very hammy. Davidson was perhaps the most wooden and un-natural actor I've ever seen on screen - his happy, sad, drunk, murderous and suicidal were all delivered with the same emotionless deadpan monotone. The dialogue was stilted and full of clich√© after clich√©. The plot was unreal and relied on suspension of disbelief - apparently English people cannot distinguish between a thick Belfast accent and a Scottish one (wait a minute, that's Americans isn't it?); apparently the IRA plot the assassination of politicians off-the-cuff the day before in the back of a car with a 5 minute run-through and then, when it goes wrong, just wing it and deliberately instigate an OK Corral shoot-out....oh my, such a bad film"

But one gets the distinct impression, as the film slowly expands to a gaseous two hours and forty minutes, that writer/director Alan J. Pakula, like a chef with a runaway souffle, lets the whole unwieldy film, from William Styron's unwieldy novel, get away from him. This feeling of directorial fumbling is especially strong in the second half, when the thing lurches rather than inexorably moves to what is intended to be a shattering conclusion and what we get instead is a rather hurried, perfunctory scene (ironic for such a long, slow film) featuring moustache twirling Nazi-ism and infant squawling, and the question ""Is that all there is?"" pervades the consciousness as we cut from the Holocaust to the Capitol Hotel in DC and a rather off putting sex scene between Streep and the annoyingly callow Peter MacNicol in what has to be one of cinema's dumber editorial decisions. You really wish someone had been around (producers Martin Starger and Keith Barish perhaps?) to gently remind Pakula, ""We don't give a hush puppy about Stingo. Or his novel. What we care about are Sophie and her surviving kid and why he didn't make it to Brooklyn."" A director in control of his or her material, a director who didn't conceitedly assign the adaptation to himself rather than to a pro like Alvin Sergeant or Jay Presson Allen, would have known how to deal with these rather important matters and how to tell this story effectively and affectingly. B minus.

PS...It took me two days to get Marvin Hamlisch's cloying theme out of my head. This is one better than his equally syrupy theme to ""The Swimmer""."

This is a rather slow horror and not that scary. It has a spooky quality to it mostly from Carpenter's music and the isolated seaside location. The story is pretty simplistic at its core.

ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK is Director John Carpenter's foray into post-apocalyptic sci-fi / action. In his vision, it's an out of control crime rate, rather than nuclear holocaust that's to blame. Packed with oddball characters, and loaded with classic scenes, EFNY became a trendsetter.

In spite of some clunky, ""futuristic"" technology, and the unavoidable poignancy of having Plisskin land atop the World Trade Center, it all works somehow. For its budget, this movie looks impressive. Russell is perfect in his eye patch-wearing, anti-hero role, riding high before his next big stint in THE THING. Great use is also made of older stars like Lee Van Cleef, Ernest Borgnine, and the inimitable music legend, Isaac Hayes.

Problem was I'd never been able to get more than 30 mins into it without something annoying me so badly I had to rage quit. Well, I finally got through it. Right to the end and yeah, it isn't for me.

Not sure what the budget was on this thing, but man oh man does it look bad. Its shot with soft lighting, and not enough lighting, and most of the time looks like Vaseline was on the lens. I think its a technique to mask the low budget special effects. Also, the famous transformation scene which I finally got to goes on for like two minutes too long and isn't that interesting. I prefer the Rat in From Dusk Till Dawn, at least he doesn't mess around. Having recently watched E.T. again I think I've identified my major problem with The Howling. Poor Dee Wallace, who also plays E.T.'s mother, is on screen most of the time, and she's just not a good actress. She's more convincing here than in E.T. but really she just doesn't sell any of it. And that really pulls a picture down when your protagonist, your anchor, just doesn't convince or draw you in. So, yeah. While probably landmark in 1983, The Howling is one I've always struggled to get through, tried to force myself to like, but at the end of the day its a movie its not homework, you don't have to like it. If I had to pinpoint the other main thing that frustrated me about The Howling it would be that the actual werewolves don't do get to do much. They spend so long transforming its like that's all they're good for. Its pretty funny when you think about it. Again, a question of what was possible with the special effects, but earlier films did more. Nosferatu (1922) and Dracula (1931) are incredible to this day. The Howling (1983) is not.

Its funny, maybe the genre just isn't for me. I can't think of a single werewolf movie I've liked except the remake to American Werewolf, and that one probably just hit me because I saw it at the right age, in the cinema. Maybe there's a time for werewolves, and you only get one chance. Its like falling in love."

The characters that he chooses to put forward to the audience as protagonists are archetypes of social and political caricatures that we would find in that particular decade; but heightened to conform to the over-the-top opulence/pestilence found central to the plot. His ability to craft characters and situations that resonate beyond the context of a particular scenario, coupled with his bitterness and unwillingness to conform is what sets him up as a satirist of serious note. He also elevates the film beyond the realms of mere art-house experimentation by fashioning a seriously funny script, which has ample opportunities for central character Albert Spica to prove himself the ultimate charismatic bully - part cockney hard man, part pantomime villain - who is never less than compulsively terrifying.

The plot is a simple construct centred on the theme of revenge and the need for personal freedom. This is mixed in with the socio-political undertones as well as Greenaway's many references to art, theatre, film and literature. It is also elevated by the impeccable cinematic qualities that we hold synonymous with the director's work. Everything here is about pushing things beyond the reasonable limitations; so we have a stunningly intricate set that is both theatrically simplistic, but also as other-worldly as anything from the work of say Gilliam or Jeunet. The costumes by Jean Paul Gaultier scream over-the-top chic, whilst often mirroring the use of colour employed by the production designers. Greenaway even breaks continuity by having Helen Mirren's costumes change colour as she moves through each room of the restaurant, so that we have a green dress in the kitchen, a red dress in the dinning area (inspired by Hitchcock's vertigo no less) and a white dress in the lavatory. It's an audacious move, but one that pays off in the creation of a completely self-contained world; something that is further established by Sacha Vierny's sumptuous cinematography and the wonderfully bombastic music of the ever-excellent Michael Nyman.

Some have clearly found the film's various abstractions problematic (yes, it is theatrical, yes it is occasionally shocking, and yes, it does evolve in a world of its own ostentatious creation). But it's also as artistic a film as you can get; a fact that some here have disputed. The reason that some define this as artistic refers to the use of colour, light and composition. The architecture of the sets too, and the way in which the production designers have chosen to dress them also adds to the artistic stylisation of the film. These factors are important to the narrative, as they are symbolic to what Greenaway is trying to convey, as well as what the characters are all about. Because of this, the design of the film becomes AS important as the framework, if not more so. But this film is more than a mere arty exploration; it's funny and intelligent and features a slew of great performances from a wonderfully eclectic cast. Michael Gambon as the thief Spica gives a grandstand performance to rival his own Phillip Marlow from The Singing Detective; hamming things up spectacularly but still retaining that much needed sense of humanity. The same can be said of the other principals too.

Mirren as the wife exudes a quite and restrained sexuality in what must be her best performance, whist Richard Bohringer as the cook is in some represents the linchpin/catalyst for the film. Elsewhere we find everyone from Tim Roth to Ian Dury popping up to give the film some added character and easily furthering the film's already cult appeal. This was a turning point for Greenaway; a move towards the more expressive, elaborate and self-contained style of film-making found in films like Prospero's Books and the Baby of Ma√ßon and away from the more easy to digest classics like the Draughtsman's Contract, Drowning by Numbers and A Zed and Two Noughts."

But ""The Grifters"" has three, all of them petty swindlers, desperate for quick cash or good odds at a ""long con"". And it's the personal relationships among these three criminals, complex, sometimes dark, and almost always motivated by survival, that make this film a pretty good bet.

Roy Dillon (John Cusack), is a trickster, a loner, ""on the grift"" for the ""short con"", strictly a nickels and dimes man. His mom is Lilly (Anjelica Huston); she's a middle-aged lady with white hair; she's seductive, cold-blooded, and tough as nails; she's been around the block a few times. Roy's love interest is Myra (Annette Bening), a shapely, fun loving babe who uses her charms to con rich businessmen. These three people are highly manipulative and scheming, on-guard, and mistrustful of each other and the rest of the world.

The film's tone is bleak and gloomy. There's very little ""heart"" in this film. And that's a problem, because I found these characters not very sympathetic. They lead lives of quiet desperation, grimy and tawdry. Still, ""The Grifters"" is a crime story in the best tradition of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, a pulpy melodrama about the underbelly of urban America.

The film's structure is conventional, and contains a number of flashbacks. The set-up is tediously long. The second half of the film is better than the first half, in my opinion, because the second half contains more suspense.

Dialogue is direct and tough, like when Lilly makes her point to the ambulance driver who takes Roy to the hospital and is skeptical about Roy's chances for survival: Says Lilly: ""My son is gonna be alright, if not, I'll have you killed"". Later, she explains the facts of life to her son: ""Grifts like anything else Roy, you don't stand still, you either go up or down, usually down, sooner or later"". Yes indeed, it's a tough life being a ""grifter""; but Lilly is one tough broad.

The film's color cinematography is fine. And the film has a terrific title sequence and a great Elmer Bernstein score at the beginning. Editing, costumes, and production design are all credible.

If you're in the mood for a gritty, bleak story of petty criminals in a well made modern film, ""The Grifters"" is a good choice. As a bonus, the DVD has an exceptionally good Commentary, with insightful comments from Director Stephen Frears, and actors John Cusack and Anjelica Huston.

I found from a documentary standpoint that this is a darned good documentary. It did what it set out to do, show me something I had no idea about and kept me interested in this world it explored. I knew nothing of the Drag world and finding out about them and the ""Balls"" was just spectacular to me. These folks were just so talented with what they do and how they do it, for competition. The catty folks, the complainers (even I was angry when someone told the judge that the coat the Drag Queen was wearing wasn't a man's coat!), the jealous, it's all there like in every other competition. LIKE EVERY OTHER COMPETITION like it. Which I felt was a point.

You had the older drag queen talking about how the Balls ""used"" to be compared to the newer drag queens who have changed the Balls and made more competition categories -- and even those who looked on knowing that the future of Balls would change even more when they were ready to walk the runway. It was interesting to hear that some of the contestants were living out on the street two minutes before the ball but came to compete, it was that important to them! Then there was sad stories, stories of who's ""house"" and ""house mother"" brought out the best and the brightest in competition. It was interesting.

Now to add after 10 years of seeing this film, I lived through the so called 'Madonna' craze. I spotted a few familiar faces from this documentary who ended up with Madonna during her ""Vogue"" phase and rightfully so. If not for those individuals, Madonna wouldn't have HAD a ""Vogue"" phase, I know that now. Credit should be given where credit is DUE. Makes me wonder, if anyone else from mainstream America would watch this documentary, they'll learn they're not as ""mainstream"" as they think.

On the heels of ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly,"" is this equally sprawling and archetypal Western, this time with less obvious dubbing, and Henry Fonda as a kind of tie in to Hollywood's hero paradigm. It's indescribably beautiful, one of the most gorgeous Westerns ever photographed, indeed a model for good visual directing and cinematography in any genre. That alone makes the almost three hours a pure pleasure.

But it's not a fast movie in any other way. It can't be. It depends on lingering over delicious details, small ones, shot up close in startling detail and ever deadpan looks and steely eyes. Nothing is believable and it's not meant to be. It's not even a fable, quite, but more a celebration of being inside an incredible film, as strange as that sounds. Not that the scenes are not believable--even the very last shots of the makeshift town and the railroad being built is about as realistic as it gets. Great stuff.

Plot? You might, at times, wonder where the plot went. There are lots of bad guys, and you're not totally sure there's a protagonist, unless the one woman in the movie is the center of our concerns, even if she is clearly a bystander to it all. When it gets clear, in the last twenty minutes, it's again archetypal (and has echoes of the over the tops showdown in ""Good Bad and Ugly""). A small bit of slow motion (not needed normally in a movie where everything is slow already) makes clear this is the key moment in the film, the thing that made the rest of it, with all its confusing and violent layers, sensible.

For my money, I'd love all this incredible visceral stuff, the sounds and sights, filled in with some kind of deeply felt conflict, not a purely dramatic one. I watch and am shocked, or swept away, or impressed, or dazzled, but I'm actually never moved, not from the heart. And there are plenty of aspects here that should really move us--including feeling for the woman's plight, rather than simply recognizing that it is, after all, quite a plight.

648,"Quiet Man, The (1952)",01-Jan-1952,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"['Comedy', 'Romance']"," I am uncertain how to critique this film objectively. I will start by making a critique of some other critiques. One complaint is the 'stereotypes' of the Irish. These complaints reveal both the Political Correctness of the complainers ¬ñ and their ignorance. The Director, John Ford (real name Sean Aloysius O'Fearna) was born and raised in Ireland and was very much the moving force in producing this movie. Why? Because he liked the script. The leading lady, Maureen O'Hara (real name Maureen Fitzsimons) was also born and raised in Ireland. She also helped get the film produced. Why? Because she liked the script.

Now, If these two Irish born participants in the picture don't find anything offensive, why should we? The greatest offense seems to be depicting the Irish as people who like to drink and fight. Having known many Irishmen I can say many do, in fact, like to drink and fight. Stereotypes usually originate in a firm foundation of fact.

Secondly, they are horribly offended by the 'violence against women', blah, blah, blah. Now, the Maureen O'Hara and John Wayne characters in this movie were repeated pretty much hereafter in every picture they did together. It is, in fact, a very old theme. People who hate the idea of a fiery, strong willed female finally tamed by a confident, dominant male can find equal hatred for Shakespeare, just read 'Taming of the Shrew'. It was an old theme when Shakespeare wrote it.

Sadly, they were so busy being offended they missed what a fine athletic performance Maureen O'Hara gave as John Wayne dragged her along. She was a real trooper. That bit of athletic performance was no mean feat.

Now, back to the film. It seemed syrupy, smalzy and contrived. So bad, at times, it was cloying and annoying. The plot seemed paper thin and artificial, merely a threadbare artifice to generate false conflict. The characters were all stock characters and hence all wholly predictable as was the inevitable outcome. Thus, with no genuine tension and no real character development that drew you in; it was hard to sustain interest in this film.

My difficulty is, as a boy, I use to love all of the John Ford/Maureen O'Hara/John Wayne pictures. Yet, I doubt most of them were any better than this. So why now do I find this so unengaging? I think because as a boy, as did the larger society, we believed these simple smarmy sentiments. I probably believed that when two men fought they would afterwards become friends ( a frequent theme in films of this era). I now know that the victor usually feels contempt for the loser and the loser has a burning hatred of the winner for the humiliation inflicted on him. And so it is with the other sentimental claptrap.

However, it may also be the era in which we live. Now we live where every disgusting, evil human perversion is just a click of the mouse away. Where car jacking, once shocking, are now just accepted as normal life. Where terrorists kill by the thousands and drug dealers enslave by the tens of thousands. We live in an era that has grown callous and cynical. Simple, smarmy sentiments like mom, home and apple pie simply don't hold much water anymore.

So, is impatience for the sugary sentiment in this picture merely a matter of growing up? Is it like the Bible says, ""When I was a child I thought like a child and acted as a child, but now I am a man and have put aside childish ways"".

Or, is it because both I and the society at large have grown hard, callous and cynical? Perhaps a little of both.

But remember, the generation that saw the release of this film loved this film. Even Hollywood did, giving it two Academy awards. And they were grown ups, having lived through a Great Depression and a World War. Certainly, they had no illusions.....

So perhaps it is just us..... A newer generation without illusions, but also without faith. I am uncertain how to critique this film objectively. I will start by making a critique of some other critiques. One complaint is the 'stereotypes' of the Irish. These complaints reveal both the Political Correctness of the complainers ¬ñ and their ignorance. The Director, John Ford (real name Sean Aloysius O'Fearna) was born and raised in Ireland and was very much the moving force in producing this movie. Why? Because he liked the script. The leading lady, Maureen O'Hara (real name Maureen Fitzsimons) was also born and raised in Ireland. She also helped get the film produced. Why? Because she liked the script.

Now, If these two Irish born participants in the picture don't find anything offensive, why should we? The greatest offense seems to be depicting the Irish as people who like to drink and fight. Having known many Irishmen I can say many do, in fact, like to drink and fight. Stereotypes usually originate in a firm foundation of fact.

Secondly, they are horribly offended by the 'violence against women', blah, blah, blah. Now, the Maureen O'Hara and John Wayne characters in this movie were repeated pretty much hereafter in every picture they did together. It is, in fact, a very old theme. People who hate the idea of a fiery, strong willed female finally tamed by a confident, dominant male can find equal hatred for Shakespeare, just read 'Taming of the Shrew'. It was an old theme when Shakespeare wrote it.

Sadly, they were so busy being offended they missed what a fine athletic performance Maureen O'Hara gave as John Wayne dragged her along. She was a real trooper. That bit of athletic performance was no mean feat.

Now, back to the film. It seemed syrupy, smalzy and contrived. So bad, at times, it was cloying and annoying. The plot seemed paper thin and artificial, merely a threadbare artifice to generate false conflict. The characters were all stock characters and hence all wholly predictable as was the inevitable outcome. Thus, with no genuine tension and no real character development that drew you in; it was hard to sustain interest in this film.

My difficulty is, as a boy, I use to love all of the John Ford/Maureen O'Hara/John Wayne pictures. Yet, I doubt most of them were any better than this. So why now do I find this so unengaging? I think because as a boy, as did the larger society, we believed these simple smarmy sentiments.

Every movie-maker capable enough to be called an auteur‚Äîby the virtue of his knack for eccentricity and novelty‚Äîhas had to borne the brunt of this naked opportunism: be it D.W. Griffith, Charles Chaplin, Orson Welles or Stanley Kubrick. Sergio Leone too had to pay collaterally by having to make five Westerns in order to get funding for his dream project, Once Upon a time in America (OUTA). OUTA is a masterpiece of epic proportions and is consummate on almost every level. The uniqueness of the movie is such that it can be looked upon from various angles with each perspective adding immensely to movie's substance and profundity. The movie not only transcends genres by making simultaneous forays into the realms of Crime, Drama, Mystery, Suspense and Fantasy, but also crosses on several occasions the fine line that separates Dream from Reality.

At the beginning of his career, Leone got widely proclaimed as a master of technique and style as he added new dimensions to cinematography and screenplay. Leone's directorial debut was 'A Fistful of dollars'. Movie's success was marred when Akira Kurosawa sued the production house for plagiarizing Yojimbo. Leone bounced back with 'For a Few More Dollars'. He single-handedly reinvented the Western genre by providing a completely different perspective to the Old West, which was hitherto portrayed as the battle ground for the epic battle of virtue versus vice in the backdrop of chivalry and machismo. With 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly', Leone perpetuated what would become his trademark: Spaghetti Western. Leone's distinctive style included juxtapositions, super close- ups, long continuous shots, and the rotating camera shots. Leone's collaboration with master-composer Ennio Morricone gave cinema some of its most mellifluous compositions. Once Upon a Time in the West elevated Leone from the position of a showman to a serious movie-maker‚Äîan auteur capable of much profound works. Leone refused a multitude of projects, including the opportunity to direct 'The Godfather', in a bid to realize his dream project.

OUTA is an epic crime saga based on the lives of Jewish gangsters from their humble childhood in the ghettos of New York to their rise in world of organized crime. 'Noodles', 'Patsy', 'Cockeye', and little Dominic struggle as street kids in the East Side of Manhattan in the early 1920s. They work for 'Bugsy', a local gangster, until they meet 'Max' and decide to start an independent operation, triggering a series of incidents which changes their lives for ever. Robert De Niro as 'Noodles' gives one of the most subtle performances of his career. James Woods is chillingly menacing as 'Max'. Young 13-year-old Jennifer Connelly as 'Deborah' serves as a pulchritudinous delight for the sour eyes, and I say this as a testament to her ethereal, nymphean charm that was evident even at such a tender age. The rest of the cast gives a great support to the actors in lead with special mention of Elizabeth McGovern, James Hayden and Joe Pesci. The music is composed by Leone's long-time collaborator Ennio Morricone, who once again works his magic by creating music that is so plaintively divine that even Mozart would be proud of it.

The film poignantly explores the themes of love, lust, friendship, greed, betrayal and loss of innocence in the backdrop of the 20th century America. For the European release, Leone cut down his original version to 229 minutes to appease the distributors. However, for the US release, OUTA was ignominiously edited down to 139 minutes by the muddle-headed studio personnel against the director's wishes. In this short version, the flashback narrative was omitted as the scenes were put back in the chronological order. Many of the movie's most beautiful shots are not present in the shorter version, including the nigh magical sequence in which time-switching is indicated by the conjuration of a Frisbee. Movie's abysmal show in the US is attributed to this sabotage. Leone was reportedly heartbroken by the American cut, and never made another film again.

The dreamlike screenplay of OUTA gives it a lyrical, almost hypnotic feel. OUTA is a tapestry of highly complex mesh work: the story depicts the lives of same individuals across three different timelines. The time-switching techniques used in the movie are so effective that the switching seems absolutely seem-less. The mystical ringing tone that the viewer gets to hear in the beginning of the movie provides a great subterfuge in unison with the dream-like finale, and adds surrealistic elements to the movie by raising doubts that the events depicted in the movie could well have been a part of a drug-induced dream that Noodles would have been experiencing under the hypnotic effect of opium. The movie has a multitude of unforgettable moments, which can be cherished again and again with the same levels of indulgence. The sequence in which little Dominic‚Äîcaught between the want to satiate his newly attained puberty and the fundamental urges‚Äîbuys a pastry to charm a neighborhood girl, but succumbs to the universal temptation and ends up eating it himself is pure gold. The scene which depicts Robert De Niro molesting his childhood love represents cinema at its most macabre. The make-up, set designing and costume designing are all top- notch. The make-up artists have gone about their business with such meticulousness that the actors seem to genuinely represent their character's age in each era.

Overall, OUTA is a testament to Sergio Leone's dedication to the free spirit of Art. It succeeds at multiple levels and makes the viewer go through an entire gamut of emotions, keeping him engaged throughout. It is sanguinary and is surfeited with blood-cuddling violence that makes it unsuitable for the weak-hearted. OUTA, however, is as a must for the enthusiasts of the genre and the cineastes worldwide. 10/10

It is one of the most patronising and formulaic films that I've seen in a long time that serves the viewer nothing but overblown sentimentality and self-righteousness.

Race is an extremely important issue that deserves to be treated with respect. This film merely seeks to exploit the highly emotionally charged issues in a pathetic attempt to try and bring hollow tears to the faces of its viewers.

Everything in this film is done by the book. All the stereotypical characters are there, lined up and ready to be used in the most clich√© of fashion. The film doesn't even try and tell a story but instead stick a load of over the top scenes together, accompanied by an extremely annoying pretentious score, that try to create many climactic ""moments"" to try and move the viewer.

Another thing that really annoyed me about this film is the title itself, ""Glory"". What is really glorious about a load of men getting killed, black or white? The film doesn't even try to portray the foolishness of war and instead resorts to partiotically flag-waving, proud that America was founded on such bloodshed. Mel Gibson in a kilt screaming ""FREEDOM"" at the top of his lungs would not seem out of place.

However, when you spray as many emotional scenes about the place at least a couple are going to hit their targets. The scene where Matthew Broderick is shouting at the stuttering squirrel shooter and fireing his pistol did manage to get a response out of me. This is because it was one of the few scenes that decided to leave race alone and attempt to deal with the reality of war. Another couple of scenes were well done too, but these scenes' resonance was muted by the overall quality of the others.

The battle scenes were well done, in a sense that they looked realistic. I thought that these might be able to help save the film but, to my dismay, as soon as I'm starting to believe in them another highly telegraphed clich√©d plot point comes along that completely breaks up the intensity and disintegrates into farce.

There isn't really a lot more than I can say about the film. I can't really comment on the quality of the acting because the actors were forced to play such one dimensional characters. I had been recommended this movie by a couple of people and had really high hopes for it, but instead of being a glorious experience it was condesending and repulsive.

In an American/Mexican border town a car bomb sets into motion a series of violence and crime, endangering Mexican Lawman Vargas (Heston) and newly Bride Susan (Janet Leigh)

Touch of Evil is all about the direction as Welles is able to show off his directional talents and then some. From the maybe most talked about opening, a bravura 3 minute tracking shot following a car with a bomb planted in the trunk, down a seedy town down to the border patrol to the very last intricate shots set through wastelands to a canal that were in no way logical to the plot but were visually pleasing very much showboating.

The plot is somewhat complex and maybe can't be grasped with just the one viewing given everything that is going on a technically as well. It reverses stereotypes, Vargas a high ranking Mexican narcotics detective and upstanding citizen with morals and an American wife. Hank Quinlan (Welles) who's power and high status in law enforcement has corrupted his mind, out for justice whether justified or not willing to plant evidence to get his target.

The acting is terrific Heston although he doesn't resemble a Mexican it doesn't matter, I believe it to be one of his best roles. Janet Leigh is stunning to look a real beauty of the screen who holds her own. Welles is a powerhouse not only his performance but also physically, his screen presence is something to marvel.

From that opening scene which sets the atmosphere and dark tone for the rest of the 90 minute or so running time, a couple of really tense scenes (A small room interrogation which also boasts Welles prowess) and at one point something horrifying ( There is an implied Gang rape that for me was pretty unsettling and for the year 1958 was a very brave thing to include in a mainstream movie, although afterwards its not to clear what happens)

This will always be held as a classic and one of the best Film Noirs around ( A genre I'm just getting into) I've seen it twice now and feel with each viewing there will be something different to notice and concentrate on. A great technical achievement that seems to be admired by film viewers and film makers alike. The black and white cinematography is stunning. A thrilling ride from start to finish.

Jack Nicholson really shines through in his role, and his acting in this film perfectly fits the character... his shark smile, his voice, his tone... all of it, perfect. I always thought, when watching films with Nicholson, that he'd make a great lead in a noir film, so when I found this film and discovered that it was indeed noir, I naturally saw it as soon as possible. I found the film to have a slightly slower pace than what I would have preferred or expected, but apart from that minor detail, it was flawless. The plot is great, and thoroughly interesting and involving. The pacing, while not fast all the time, is more than acceptable. There are sequences that are really intense and exciting. The acting is great... like I said earlier, Nicholson shines through and really takes this character and makes him his own. The characters are well-written and credible. The special effects are well-done and still hold up pretty well. The dialog is very well-written and memorable. There are quite a few quotable lines, as well. The cinematography is good, and even when the plot doesn't move a lot, Polanski keeps our interest through interesting angles and sequences. I liked that there was often something subtle going on in the background, while we're focusing on what's directly in front of us. While Polanski certainly doesn't possess the attention to detail that Kubrick does, he manages to put a good bit of detail into many of the shots, and there is fairly little left to coincidence or chance, much like Kubrick. The film has a few twists that are quite good, and they come as surprises... I don't think I really saw them coming, and I doubt anyone would be able to. Of course, some might not find the twists to be that impressive, but the story stands on it's own nicely as well. This is a great movie, which should be seen by just about anyone who can take it(it's more than just casually adult in nature, even though there's not that much violence or sex in it). I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys film noir, watching Jack Nicholson in perfect shape in a role that was tailor-made for him, a good mystery, Roman Polanski's direction and just a good movie with a more adult tone that many others. 10/10 While I don't care too much for Roman Polanski's style of direction(maybe I'll grow to like it eventually, maybe not), I can't deny that this is a truly great film.

I will say I absolutely loved Shawshank Redemption, and despite the fact that it was unfaithful to the book, and badly flawed, I liked It too.

Stand By Me, based on the novella by Stephen King, which I admit I haven't read, not only has a wonderfully engaging story, but it is both funny and moving. This is helped by the strong and wholly believable performances from the entire cast that include Kiefer Sutherland, John Cusack, Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Conell and River Pheonix especially.

The script was very well-crafted, and the film tells brilliantly of the values of friendship and standing together. Other strengths were the beautiful photography and the fine direction from Rob Reiner. But what impressed me most about Stand By Me was not only its nostalgic feel, but despite the hour and a half running time, the characters particularly Chris were so well developed. And I mustn't forget the beautiful song Stand By Me over the end credits.

A beautiful, unforgettable film, with a definite 10/10. Bethany Cox.

This is helped by the strong and wholly believable performances from the entire cast that include Kiefer Sutherland, John Cusack, Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Conell and River Pheonix especially.

The script was very well-crafted, and the film tells brilliantly of the values of friendship and standing together. Other strengths were the beautiful photography and the fine direction from Rob Reiner. But what impressed me most about Stand By Me was not only its nostalgic feel, but despite the hour and a half running time, the characters particularly Chris were so well developed. And I mustn't forget the beautiful song Stand By Me over the end credits.

A beautiful, unforgettable film, with a definite 10/10. Bethany Cox."

The story of M concerns a serial killer who preys on children & presents an underworld society whose usual business is disrupted due to the everyday raids carried out by the police to apprehend the killer-on-loose. Driven by police's continued failure & increasing losses in their business, the criminal bosses ultimately decide to take matters in their own hands & try to capture the killer all by themselves.

Directed by Fritz Lang, this is the film that the esteemed director called his finest & it's not really difficult to see why. The screenplay & direction brims with creativity, the suspense is wonderfully created & utilized, black-n-white photography is crisp & inventive, editing never lets the story settle down, score & sound effects work in seamless harmony, and Peter Lorre steals the show with a highly compelling performance.

On an overall scale, M is a cinematic treasure that has innovation written all over it. Whether it's the narrative style, leitmotifs, camera angles, sound mixing, symbolism or expressions, the contribution this German classic has made in the world of filmmaking is groundbreaking. A thought-provoking & well-researched study into the mind of a disturbed character, M is a strong meditation on the morals of right & wrong, that has a lot to say about our very own society.

I was expecting right wing propaganda, or possibly even (a distant outside chance) left wing propaganda: I certainly wasn't expecting THIS. It isn't propaganda at all. Deriving any kind of message at all from the film is difficult - one might be tempted to conclude that we ought to never trust people who cry cheap political insults like ""communist!"" or ""fascist!"" or ""racist!"" at the first opportunity, but that's just a thought. At any rate, in order to get a message we have to think about the story for ourselves, very carefully, which makes it the very opposite of propaganda.

Here's another bit of advice: don't make the mistake, as I did, of thinking now and then that Frankenheimer is drifting from the point. He knows exactly what he's doing at all times. Whenever it seems he's offering some interesting diversion from the main story he's really telling the main story by other means. How good the story is I cannot convey without saying too much. Probably the central conceit everyone knows already, which was why Frankenheimer was right to spill most of the beans as soon as possible - but he does has one or two in reserve. One great thing about the story is that it doesn't rely at all on us thinking it likely.

Everyone, from composer to cameraman, did a fine job, and the cast does an even finer one. Angela Lansbury gives the performance of her life. Frank Sinatra I had never seen in a movie before, and I was surprised to discover that he can act - very well, too. It permeates down to the minor roles.

Slater plays a young transfer student from an eastern high school to a new school in Arizona. His Clark Kent persona is a mild mannered wallflower type. But his father made the mistake of giving him a short wave radio set to keep in touch with friends back east who are presumably ham radio operators. What Slater does is create his own pirate radio station and starts with another whole personality of disc jockey Harry Hardon. Slater's other self isn't Superman, he's more like a teenage version of Howard Beale from Network.

He's amusing at first until one of the students commits suicide after calling in and Slater does little to discourage his intentions. That's a hard call to make, even professionals miss telltale signs of that kind of serious depression.

But when Slater starts disrupting the power structure in the person of principal Annie Ross, the hunt is on with even the Federal Communications Commission brought in to track down this broadcasting felon. Imagine Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest as a school principal and you've got Ross.

The main weakness of Pump Up The Volume is that Slater and Ross create the only two memorable characters. All the rest are strictly in support, we get no insights into any of the rest of the cast. But these two are memorable characters. A teenage mad prophet of the air and a school principal from hell.

Mortimer and Elaine take a taxi to Brooklyn to bring their luggage and Mortimer visits his adorable elderly aunts Abby (Josephine Hull) and Martha Brewster (Jean Adair), who raised him and are considered Good Samaritans in the neighborhood, renting rooms and giving meals to the poor. His aunts live with his insane brother Teddy (John Alexander), who believes that is Theodore Roosevelt and is digging locks for the Panama Canal in the basement of the house. When Mortimer is ready to go, he finds a dead body hidden in the window seat and his aunts explains that they have murdered the poor men for charity to stop their suffering serving wine spiked with arsenic and other poisons. Then Teddy buries the corpses in the locks believing that they had yellow fever.

Mortimer decides to send Teddy to the Happy Dale Sanatorium but things get worse when his other insane and cruel brother Jonathan Brewster (Raymond Massey), who had disappeared twenty years ago and has the face of Boris Karloff, unexpectedly appears in the house with his alcoholic partner, the plastic surgeon Dr. Einstein (Peter Lorre), expecting to find a place to dispose the corpse of his victim. The place transforms in a nuthouse.

This time the story is set on a military base where Steve Malone moves in with his family. His job to look for toxins that might be at high levels in the grounds of the base, but soon strange things begin to happen and certain people ""aren't themselves anymore."" People who have seen the previous two versions know exactly what this means. However, whether you know or not the film manages to be an eerie thriller in parts. There is a change in perspective from the previous two versions as the focus here is more on the family, but it still remains in subtle ways as a parable. But it is that family aspect that gives this version its push. The examination of trust and mistrust within the family unsentimental and compelling. Carol's monologue to her husband Steve in a key moment will literally make you grow goosebumps. And the end, which will be familiar to those of you who've seen the previous version, has it's own spin and take on the situation and what led up to it. The way hope and despair are mixed and shown makes the ending worth seeing, but unexpectedly abrupt. Though, abrupt in this case means ""chilling."" That makes it not quite the first which ended in despair. Different from the second which was chilling, but final moment was that of terror. Here it is... just chilling.

The production values are great and very stylish. The cinematography is beautiful, and the setting and lighting is suitably atmospheric.

Phillip Glass's hypnotic and goosebump-inducing score is also very effective, Bernard Rose directs brilliantly, the story is always gripping with Candyman's origins especially well done the dialogue is thought-provoking, intelligent and fits each scene accordingly.

The film is a good length and goes at a well-judged pace. The performances are impressive too, Virginia Madsen is simply terrific in a difficult role while Tony Todd is absolutely terrifying down from his posture to his voice. In fact, for me the only real downside was the ending, it was a sort of ""it's not over"" ending, and for me(I may be biased as I am not a fan of this type of ending) it felt tacky.

After reading some of the reviews of the movie, I've decided to see on my own for the first time. I must say that I wasn't expecting a whole lot out of this movie because a lot of people who have seen it compared it to the original 1942 Val Lewton picture from RKO. Well, I was very impressed by this version of Cat People and I must say that it's a exceptionally well made, well acted psychological horror film.

Irena, (Nastassja Kinski), arrives in New Orleans, visiting her brother, Paul, (Malcolm McDowell), for the first time. As the movie begins, Schrader sets up the movie very well. Hundreds of years ago, the feline group of mysterious people, called the Cat People, have the ability to change into a black leopard after mating. Unknowable to Irena, Paul starts to develop a incestuous feeling toward her as in one scene, which is, one of the best scenes in the movie, he stalks her while she sleeps in his house for the first time.

Soon enough, Irena is given a job at the local zoo in New Orleans by Oliver Yates, (John Heard). Yates soon starts a relationship with Irena after he witnesses her watching a black leopard, roaming around its cage, milling for food. Irena doesn't tell Oliver about her family secret. Instead, the movie gets even better when Heard and Kinski start a relationship between the two while McDowell takes a turn of the worse, using his cat-like instinct to kill and prey on women, living in New Orleans.

Almost some of Paul Schrader's films walk a tightrope between sexual tensions. He never back away from that particular theme in Cat People. Schrader, as you may know, written the screenplay for Taxi Driver and also directed two feature films, Hardcore, which shares some of the same elements in this film and American Gigolo. His films are quite daring, but nevertheless, interesting and engaging.

Some people might look at this movie as a sleazy exploitation horror film. But, to the tell you the truth, it is not. This is a very good looking movie, with great cinematography, showcasing many colorful sets and sights in New Orleans. Some of the scenes are quite suspenseful, almost ranking up there with the Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. The imagery that is used in this movie are very well shot and photographed. One scene that sums it up at all up is when Kinski witnesses a leopard, tearing out a zookeeper's arm. What makes that scene work is that Schrader cuts that with a shot of a pool of blood, running through Kinski's shoes and into a drain in the floor of the zoo. That's very well done, indeed. You can almost feel the darkness and mystery of the picture itself, thanks to the superb music score by Giorgio Moroder.

Nastassja Kinski, I think, steals the movie, away from John Heard and Malcolm McDowell. She is one of the most interesting and mysterious actresses I've ever seen. She provides the movie with a spice of eroticism that lights up the scenes. You can't talk your eyes off of her nor ignore her. She is really something in this movie. Unlike so many other female characters in horror movies, she gives Irena a mind of her own when she develops sexual feeling toward the two completely different men. That's very daring for a actress to do in the movies.

Cat People is a very scary horror film that's very well made by Paul Schrader and also scored very effectively by Giorgio Moroder. An very good movie for adults to see. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ 1/2 3 1/2 stars.

The story of ""The Crucible"" is very basic: a community, mad with hysteria, brings itself to its downfall. The story centers on Abigail Williams, played by Winona Ryder. She was the maid of John Proctor and his wife, Elizabeth, played by Daniel Day-Lewis and Joan Allen. Elizabeth suspects John of adultery with Abigail, so she and John agree to fire her. Abigail resorts to witchcraft to try and win John's heart, but when her uncle (the Reverend of their village's church) witnesses her dancing with other young girls of the community, she and her cousin are set into a panic. Their dancing was believed to be sinful and full of witchery. The next morning, Abigail's cousin Ruth is paralyzed in bed and this confuses the town. They think that the devil is the one to blame. This sets into motion the hysteria and suspicion of witchcraft and communication with the devil. No one in the village was safe from being condemned by Abigail and her dancing friends. The witch hysteria calls for immediate attention. Enter Judge Thomas Danforth, played by Paul Scofield. There are many trials and many innocent people getting accused of witchery, and no one is exempt, not even John or Elizabeth. The inevitable comes to pass.

I thought that this movie was poorly acted. There were some standouts in lead roles, but the supporting roles seemed to have been overlooked. There are four leads in this movie: John Procter, Abigail Williams, Elizabeth Proctor, and Judge Thomas Danforth. John Procter is played with lackluster enthusiasm by the great, two-time Academy Award Winning Daniel Day-Lewis. He seems to lack passion or care until the last scene, but by that time, I had lost hope and resigned myself to his weak performance. It is slightly unfair, though, that I say this, seeing as it was a pretty good performance, but I am naturally going to be biased as I have seen him in so many considerably better performances, some of the best of film (""My Left Foot"", ""There Will Be Blood"", etc.). He should have thought before he set the bar so high for his work. The other bad lead role was Abigail, played horrifically by Winona Ryder. I'll admit, her performance was bad, very bad, but it didn't help that throughout the movie, I despised her character. Even so, I am one to appreciate devious and villainous characters if they are played with villainy and passion. She gave an uninspired performance, to say the least. One of the lead roles that was superbly acted was the role of Elizabeth, played by Joan Allen. She plays her with such subtlety that I couldn't help liking her performance. She was the only member in the cast to receive an Academy Award nomination. The other wonderfully played lead role was the role of Judge Danforth, played magnificently by Paul Scofield. He played Thomas Moore in ""A Man For All Seasons"", which won him an Academy Award. He is such an implausibly underrated actor; I wish to see him in more roles. He is type-casted in this role, playing another law official, but it's for the better.

The writing is nothing to complain about. It follows fairly accurate with the play, although there are some differences, as you would find with any movie based on a previously written material. This movie, though, has an advantage. It was written by Arthur Miller, the same man who wrote the original play. There weren't too many noticeable differences. One scene played out outside, rather than in the courthouse where it was originally set. The dance of the girls was shown in the film, but in the play it was only talked about, but there weren't too many differences. Naturally, the dialogue was drawn out longer, but the duration of the movie is longer then the duration of the play. I liked the satiric aspect of the movie. If one of the girls had a grudge to bear with any member in town, they would recall an instance in the past that would make officials believe that the person was a witch. I thought that it was funny in a way, but the directing made it less comedic and more pitiful and dramatic. The scenery was dreary and tired and worn down. The filming was bland and forgettable. ""The Crucible"" lends itself better as a play than a movie. This play was based on an event happening at the time that Miller wrote it.

Senator Joseph McCarthy was spitting out accusations everywhere that people were Communists. If they denied that they were Communists, then they were thought guilty and were declared Communists, but if they admitted to being one, then they were let off the hook. This modern day witch-hunt known as ""McCarthyism"" mirrors Miller's play almost exactly.

The movie had many flaws. It made me feel uncomfortable and eerie, which makes me not like it, but thinking over that, I realize that that is possibly the director's intention, and if so, then well done. I can only recommend it to people that are interested in the witch-hunts. It wasn't that boring, it was actually entertaining (in a strange way), but it was very predictable. It was a strange movie, the acting was OK, the story is good, but the direction was weak. There were some very tense moments on screen, which made for thrilling cinema, but its faults are greater then its perks, but I think it would be worth it to check it out.

There are so many classic scenes. I got my girlfriend to watch it. She was convinced it was going to be a stupid Arnold muscle movie (it seems almost everyone thinks this) but she loved it.

It's such a change to see such an un-ironic passionate movie. I can't see a movie like this being made today. The nudity and violence were great and added realism without ever being flatly gratuitous.

I think that I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER is a rip-off of SCREAM, but a rip-off that can be enjoyed. Plots are similar, but not identical. It also has the similar pretty-teenager-being-stabbed-to-death feel to it.

On graduation night, four friends Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt), Helen Shivers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Barry Cox (Ryan Phillippe) and Ray Bronson (Freddie Prinze Jr.) go joyriding while drunk and accidentally run over and supposedly kill somebody in the street. While dumping the body in a bay, the body attacks Barry, then falls into the water. The four assume that he is dead, but the next summer they get notes saying ""I know what you did last summer"". The next thing you know, friends of the four are being murdered left and right and these four become the killer's next targets.

The plot is fair, but not especially interesting. I found the SCREAM plot to be much better. The acting and character development in SCREAM are better too. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sarah Michelle Gellar both do excellent jobs. Freddie Prinze Jr. is the worst actor I've ever seen in my life, and Ryan Phillippe does a fair job. Ann Heche is very good in the part that she has.

The characters, aside from Hewitt, Gellar and Heche, are very thin and rather boring. The killer himself is pretty interesting and fairly cool. The ending of this movie bites. It's maybe worth a rent, but if you want to see a movie of this style I'd recommend URBAN LEGENDS or SCREAM. I saw SCREAM and SCREAM 2 before I saw I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER.

This is about an aging Secret Service guy who is haunted by his past. That past urges him to keep the current President safe at all costs with election nearing. Even if that means playing a cat-and-mouse game with someone who wants to kill the President.

If you changed the name of The Jackal character to something else there`s very little chance Frederick Forsyth or anyone else would have sued for plagerism . As it is watching this Americanised version I found myself saying out loud "" The original was better . The original was better . The original ... """

The best thing about Seven Years in Tibet is the breathtaking high mountain scenery. How disappointing to learn the movie was shot in the Andes and not the Himalayas. The story is also compelling following Harrar as he morphs from selfish pig to generally nice guy. Unfortunately it's sometimes awkwardly told, and is over-long. And finally the use of English language dialogue as variously English, German, and Tibetan was as off-putting as Pitt's on-again, off-again German accent.

Second, I felt that there was too much of an attempt to unravel human behaviour. I appreciate that it was a sub-theme, but the film makers seemed to explore it without giving an insight or thorough reflection.

However, as far as sci-fi genre films go, this is way up there as it bursts with originality and moves at a modest pace - exploring the intricacies of the story line and providing a good build up, but was neither overly long nor rushed.

Douglas is good in the lead and looks quite acceptable as the President of the US - lets be honest, if it was him or ""oil baron"" Bush who would you pick? Bening is also good as Sydney but neither have anything outside of the usual romantic leads to do.

That this documentary is necessary at all is down to her association with the vilest and most evil regimes in history: Hitler & the Nazis.

The documentary maker, M√ºller, does not hold back in showing us - and by extension Riefenstahl herself - what she did, what her involvement was in Germany in the 1930s. Similarly, M√ºller tries to hold Riefenstahl to account. It's interesting to watch the 90-year-old pushing back and holding to the line that she's always held: that she was never a party member, never a true believer. Watch this documentary and see what you think.

There's no question that, seen through today's eyes, Triumph of the Will (TotW), and Olympia can be seen as propaganda. However, the former film won top awards before the war for its innovative techniques and imagery. The art is there. The films weren't seen as propaganda in 1938.... The problem, for Riefenstahl, is that these films are seen as propaganda NOW.

The other problem is that these two films are just too good as innovative art-in-cinema. In this documentary, it comes through that Riefenstahl wishes she hadn't made TofW. All of her (probably well-rehearsed) protestations about not knowing or realising what Hitler was are acceptable. As a matter of fact, Riefenstahl made no further ""propaganda"" films after Olympia (1936-38). If she had been a committed follower, then she would have made dozens of films for the Nazis 1936-45. Others did (e.g Veit Harlan). But she didn't. This suggests to me that there is a large element of truth in what she says here.

She was appalled by what she saw in Poland in 1939. This also moved her strongly away from wanting to make films for the regime.

Riefenstahl fell out badly with the Nazi authorities. She states that even as early as 1934, Goebbels hated her - and he was in control of the Nazi propaganda industry. She clearly was a strong minded artist who refused to be seduced or controlled.

The pity of it all is that Riefenstahl was pilloried and rejected after the war and made no further major contributions to cinema. In this documentary, we sense her regret - but we also sense that she is prepared to stand and justify her pre-war work. She cannot, even many years after the events, be separated from her art, even though many have identified her as a Nazi sympathiser because of it.

This documentary is about an hour too long - but then perhaps it has to be? Riefenstahl is a strong and compelling person.

702,Barcelona (1994),01-Jan-1994,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"['Comedy', 'Romance']"," ""Barcelona"" is a bizarre film that captures your attention through the fast-paced repertoire, but looses you through unfocused political jargon that doesn't seem important, but is obviously an instrumental part of the film. This is where the struggle occurs for this film. It is an internal struggle because of the popularity of ""Metropolitan"" you want to enjoy this film, feel that brush of fresh air, and laugh at what others would consider ""intelligent banter"", but even with the subtle humor between Eigeman and Nichols there is something missing that connects the crucial plot elements together. Stillman has created another valuable film, but it feels more like he was trying to reproduce the excitement of ""Metropolitan"" than create a new voice.

One cannot argue that Wit Stillman's style of film-making is still seen throughout modern cinema culture. While watching ""Barcelona"", there was this eerie feeling of watching ""The Darjeeling Limited"" again. Stillman's voice can be found in nearly all Wes Anderson films, the witty conversation, the intellectual characters, and the thin layer of plot are Stillman's characteristics seen today. Take ""Margo at the Wedding"", Baumback uses Stillman with honor and respect, and can even been better seen in Baumback's early ""Kicking and Screaming"". The key difference between these modern directors and Stillman's ""Barcelona"" is that they develop both plot and characters. Stillman's visual technique, his ability to capture the sense of normality, and control of the language is powerful in this film, but an apathetic feel for Ted and Fred, coupled with a lack of focus ¬ñ pushed ""Barcelona"" from challenging second film to average sophomoric effort. From a sales perspective, Ted and Fred couldn't persuade me to do anything, much less follow them around. Their jovial voice and constant bickering would amuse at first, but like the film became annoying near the end. From a character standpoint, Ted (Taylor Nichols) was enjoyable to watch. He felt like the stuck-in-sales type of guy that others could relate to. Aside from the religious dance scene (continuing with the unfocused plot idea), he was the quintessential hero of this film. Fred (Christopher Eigeman) covers the other end of the spectrum entirely. There was no belief that he was a Navy officer, his constant lying and possible theft (again ¬ñ that kayaking scene that lead ultimately nowhere) just created an annoying character that tried to be funny, but never was. There was this sense that Eigeman didn't understand he and Nichols' character relationship. One needs to ask, was Nichols' stutter part of the character, or just Stillman's lack of editing? Finally, what was Mira Sorvino doing here? Her accent was thicker than pea soup, yet as unbelievable as pea soup finding its way into a Whit Stillman film.

The obscurity of the actors leading us through this political comedy/drama, was a tough nail to bite, but the tougher one was the overall plot of this film. Stillman's goal was to make humor out of an odd anti-American culture in Spain. His actors, as mentioned, tried to bring the humor, but it was up to Stillman to bring us the connectors and overall themes of ""Barcelona"". It is this area that I felt Stillman was at his weakest. While the actors were not quite the caliber of Stillman's original effort, they at least made me chuckle and think of Wes Anderson's films, but I felt forced and confused by where Stillman was headed with the camera. The bomb at the beginning seemed pass√©, the anti-Americanism comments seemed less real ¬ñ Stillman never quite secured the feel of realism with this film. Our two characters walk down the street, talk-back to those who oppose them, and show less emotion when the dramatic ending takes place ¬ñ there just wasn't that sense of fear. This felt insulting. Stillman's eye in this film felt bored, stale, and unenergetic. This needs to be a stand alone film for Stillman, but I found myself comparing it to ""Metropolitan"" constantly. This film was missing that freshness, or that sense of excitement, and that desire to see the unknown. The relationships were bland, the characters were humorous ¬ñ but un-follow-able, and the story itself felt forced. This wasn't Stillman's greatest outing. He made some choices that didn't translate well onto the bigger screen. The colors even tired my eyes ¬ñ it just wasn't the film I expected, or wanted, from Stillman.

Overall, ""Barcelona"" was a second outing for Whit Stillman, but it wasn't the caliber of ""Metropolitan"". This film felt old, used, and un-welcomed in Stillman's repertoire of characters and language. There was plenty of potential, but it went unused with people like Mira Sorvino attempting to capture the essence of a Spanish woman. Again, I want to state that this film had some very funny moments that were as dry as any martini one could hope for. It had my laughing, but it wasn't enough. I wanted a detailed story, I wanted some of the issues about being a salesman come out clearer, and I wanted that random scene of religion and dancing to carry more gumption. ""Barcelona"" felt as if Stillman would start ideas, but never quite complete them. This film reminded me of Kevin Smith's early work. Using the same actors, Smith would attempt to recreate the same characters in different environments with mixed results. The power and honesty of Smith's ""Clerks"" could never be recreated and thus the doomed ""Clerks II"" will never reach cult status. That analogy could be used for Stillman's ""Barcelona"". He tried, but there is a reason this film wasn't nominated for the best screenplay category ¬ñ it just felt elusive and incomplete.

Grade: *** (hesitantly) out of ***** ""Barcelona"" is a bizarre film that captures your attention through the fast-paced repertoire, but looses you through unfocused political jargon that doesn't seem important, but is obviously an instrumental part of the film. This is where the struggle occurs for this film. It is an internal struggle because of the popularity of ""Metropolitan"" you want to enjoy this film, feel that brush of fresh air, and laugh at what others would consider ""intelligent banter"", but even with the subtle humor between Eigeman and Nichols there is something missing that connects the crucial plot elements together. Stillman has created another valuable film, but it feels more like he was trying to reproduce the excitement of ""Metropolitan"" than create a new voice.

One cannot argue that Wit Stillman's style of film-making is still seen throughout modern cinema culture. While watching ""Barcelona"", there was this eerie feeling of watching ""The Darjeeling Limited"" again. Stillman's voice can be found in nearly all Wes Anderson films, the witty conversation, the intellectual characters, and the thin layer of plot are Stillman's characteristics seen today. Take ""Margo at the Wedding"", Baumback uses Stillman with honor and respect, and can even been better seen in Baumback's early ""Kicking and Screaming"". The key difference between these modern directors and Stillman's ""Barcelona"" is that they develop both plot and characters. Stillman's visual technique, his ability to capture the sense of normality, and control of the language is powerful in this film, but an apathetic feel for Ted and Fred, coupled with a lack of focus ¬ñ pushed ""Barcelona"" from challenging second film to average sophomoric effort.

704,"House of the Spirits, The (1993)",01-Jan-1993,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"['Drama', 'Romance']"," Saw 'House of the Spirits' for two primary reasons, regardless of its less than great critical reception. One was for Isabel Allende's incredible book that it is based on, one of my favourites for its richness and emotional impact, did have my concerns as to knowing how difficult to adapt it would be. The other was for the cast with some immensely talented actors and actresses. Did think to myself, it is hard to go wrong with Meryl Streep, Glenn Close, Jeremy Irons, Vanessa Redgrave, Winona Ryder and Antonio Banderas.

Didn't think that 'House of the Spirits' was that bad, but it should have been so much better. It is severely underwhelming as an adaptation, with so much left out, so much simplified and with changes that don't make sense, confirming my worries of it being one of those books that should be left alone and doesn't translate well to film. It would have been much better as a mini-series of at least 6 one-hour parts. Actually also think though that one doesn't need to have read the book to be disappointed, as 'House of the Spirits' has noticeable flaws on its own terms.

There are good things here. 'House of the Spirits' looks fantastic for starters. Especially the majestic scenery and elegant interiors of the family home, all gorgeously photographed. The costumes are evocative enough and the make-up is more than convincing, with Irons especially unrecognisable as an older man. Hans Zimmer's score fits beautifully with a haunting main theme that's still in my mind. Found the last forty five minutes, with the portrayal of the revolution and the brutality it brought, or so both harrowing and moving, it is also the portion of the film where there are the most signs of a plot.

Of the cast, only Banderas passes as a Chilean in terms of how they look and speak and the accents waver from trying too hard (Irons) to not even attempting one (Ryder). Regardless of that, most do their best with what they have and do capably. Irons especially as the most, and only, properly interesting and richly drawn character gives his all and dominates the film, maybe too much to the point of hamminess in some of the earlier portions of the film where Esteban is pretty much irredeemably detestable (much of the time he is chilling). But when older and more repentent he is much more subtle, whether speaking or conveying a lot while saying little to nothing, yet manages to be authoritative and oddly affecting. On a side note he reunited with director Billie August twenty years later for 'Night Train to Lisbon', did find that a better film and preferred his performance in that despite the character being less complex, am writing this much about him because there is also much to say about Esteban and in a way he is the main character.

Streep is graceful and epitomises pathos as Clara, especially later on and although they didn't create the same magic as they did so well in 'The French Lieutenant's' Woman' her chemistry with Irons is sincerely done. Close has too little to do but is appropriately sympathetic yet stern. Banderas is dashing and Redgrave and Armin Mueller-Stahl make much of their limited screen time. Vincent Gallo is chilling in his small role and Grace Gummer (real life daughter of Streep) and Sasha Hanau are adorable without being saccharine as young Clara and Alba, Hanau especially.

Excepting the final forty five minutes or so where she is quite powerful and some nice chemistry with Irons, Ryder for me was the cast's weak link as she came over as out of place and too modern in looks and how she spoke (which tended to be too much of one-note)

Although as an adaptation 'House of the Spirits' is too short, the book doesn't translate too well as a two and a half hour film. Somehow the film, and it is the storytelling that dooms the film, feels dull with too much of a pedestrian pace and dramatically it feels anaemic and thin and uneventful in spots with any emotional power only coming out in spurts. With the abrupt jumps in time and the disjointed feel of the scenes and events following on from each other and so many plot strands and characters, 'House of the Spirits' can be very jumpy and hard to follow. Even telling who was who was confusing at first, especially for those who have read the book.

Found the character development bland to barely there, only Esteban shows signs of developing and believably. The character interaction is not always natural and could be static, particularly in the early parts, much isn't gone into anywhere near enough depth and the dialogue is trite and stilted. Particularly early on and in the heavy-handedly handled political-oriented moments. August took on an ambitious task and it proved to be too over-ambitious, he succeeds when it comes to the visuals but he fails in making the drama compelling or emotionally investable. For so much content crammed in for two and a half hours, 'House of the Spirits' did feel oddly bloated, despite so much left out and simplified, and like it tried to do too much.

Concluding, watchable film but underwhelming considering the amount of potential it had. 5/10 Saw 'House of the Spirits' for two primary reasons, regardless of its less than great critical reception.

705,Singin' in the Rain (1952),01-Jan-1952,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,"['Musical', 'Romance']"," I'm going to confine my comments about ""Singin' in the Rain"" to the ""Broadway Rhythm"" sequence where Cyd Charisse steals the movie without saying a word. In my view, Charisse, who is still gorgeous at 83, was the quintessential movie dancer of the 1950s. Her height, elegance, aloofness and those impossibly long legs -- along with an uncanny ability to match her style to that of her partner -- makes watching her dance a mesmerizing experience.

Many have said that the two numbers in ""Singin' in the Rain"" that feature Charisse probably belong in another movie. I don't know¬Ö as the flapper in jade, she sexes up Kelly's rube character to a steamy height unusual in movies of that era. In a dance full of wonderful moves, my favorite comes after she's left him with her cigarette holder. She sashays away from him, blowing on her nails in studied boredom. She's gotten some distance away, and as she tosses her right hand back, he throws down the cigarette holder, grabs her hand and brings her flying up to his chest, where she proceeds to slide down Kelly's thigh to the floor for one of several prone positions she takes during this duet, from which she returns to a standing position with amazing grace. I'm not wild about dances that rely heavily on props, but this one does so very effectively: they're amusing and they reinforce character.

And thank heaven for the artistic control that allowed Kelly to keep the ""crazy veil"" number in the picture. Charisse has discussed that dance, where she got to show off her early ballet training, most charmingly for a ""Word of Mouth"" feature on TCM. She and others have noted over the years that the wind machines required to keep that impossibly long veil moving and undulating between and above her and Kelly made filming a nightmare. But it looks effortless, on a set that is a subtle optical illusion¬ónot as deep nor as sloped as it appears to be.

Both dances end the same way. Whether she's a cheap gangster's moll in garish green or a Grecian goddess in white, less obviously in a mobster's sway, Charisse is invariably lured back to reality by proffered baubles and menacingly tossed coins. But at the end of the crazy veil number, she's the one tossing the coins.

MIRANDA RICHARDSON is the quiet housewife who seems to think her husband is bored with her; POLLY WALKER is a pretty socialite who wants to be admired for more than her beauty; JOAN PLOWBRIGHT is a crotchety older woman who learns to appreciate friendship when it's offered; and JOSIE LAWRENCE is the rather scatterbrained, almost eccentric woman who is unsure about her marriage until she invites her husband (JIM BROADBENT) to the charming place in the country where she feels nothing but good vibes. MICHAEL KITCHEN is the owner of the villa who falls for Richardson, thinking she's a widow, but then finds consolation with the pretty socialite who appreciates that he didn't warm up to her on the basis of her looks alone (he's nearsighted).

Most humorous aspect of the story is the relationship between Walker and her hubby, ALFRED MOLINA, whose relaxing bath turns into one of the films only ""explosive"" moments when he fails to understand Italian and the meaning of the word for dangerous.

It's a simple tale, woven tightly together by the four strands of storytelling, and passes the time pleasantly enough even though there are times when nothing seems to be happening. The pace is very slow, even for a film with a running time of little more than an hour and thirty minutes, so it's not a tale for every taste. It's a quietly reflective character study of perfect strangers learning about each other.

Nicely photographed in Italian locations, it's visually pleasing and easy to take, but really nothing special happens here.

There's not much of a story - it's about an innovative dancer, Scott Hastings (Mercurio) whose parents (Thomson and Barry Otto) run a dance studio. The beginning is done in documentary style as his mother, Janet Leigh on crack, relates, her voice trembling with emotion, that it's Scott's year to win the Pan Pacific Grand Prix dance competition. Unfortunately, during the regionals, he broke out and did non-sanctioned steps, and his partner deserted him. This is all treated with the seriousness of a brain operation, which makes the film even more hilarious. A nerdy girl named Fran approaches Scott in the studio and asks to partner with him. He gives her a chance, and then needs to make a decision - win the Pan Pacific or do his own thing on the dance floor. On the way to the competition, some family secrets are revealed, and he and Fran fall in love.

Told with hilarity, poignancy, and beautiful dancing, this is one of the all-time great dance films with Mercurio's electrifying moves, hot body, and good looks raising it to a very high level. Luhrmann's fast-paced and creative direction makes the film fly by. Some of the photography is spectacular: dancing in front of the neon Coca-Cola sign, Scott learning the paso doble from Fran's relatives as a train passes by, a kiss at twilight, and the color-mad, cartoon-like flashback scene near the end of the film. The dance sequences themselves are fabulous, with the outrageous costumes, wild hair and beautiful steps.

All of the performances are good, but my favorite by far is Thomson as a former ballroom star who puts on her ""happy face"" though her heart is breaking, i.e., Scott doesn't have a partner, Scott won't dance the correct steps - her constant near hysterics and overly dramatic concern are fantastic.

The undertone of the film concerns the slimy, toupeed head of the regulatory committee Barry Fife (Hunter) who wants ballroom dance to remain conservative and by the book. Given the interior battles in the ice dancing arena, it wouldn't surprise me if such a thing exists in ballroom as well. No selfish, crowd-pleasing steps! Just make it -strictly ballroom. If you've never seen this gem, go out and get it.

The director finds time for sex scenes but leaves out scenes that are vital to fully understanding the background and the relationships and what is going on.

The film is good, but should have been longer. Laurence Fishburne is good in the title role but not incredible, and again, he is missing some of his best lines due to editing. Irene Jacob is a bit weak as Desdemona and I do think it may have to do with English not being her native tongue. Kenneth Branagh as Iago virtually steals every scene he is in. He is just delicious. Fortunately he is in most of the scenes. He is evil even when he is about to make love to his wife, perhaps not in a way that she would like at all, from what I could tell.

See it but then see one of the versions that does not have so much text cut out.

Nicole, looking absolutely ravishing throughout, is a completely self-serving sociopath named Suzanne Stone who's simply hellbent on achieving her personal American dream of being a TV personality. When she realizes that her nice guy husband Larry (Matt Dillon, in a solid change of pace performance) is going to be an obstacle in her path, she turns on the heat and convinces dumb as dirt, lovelorn teenager Jimmy Emmett (Joaquin Phoenix, in his breakthrough performance) to bump off Larry. She then proceeds to play to the media to her hearts' content.

22 years later, this film version remains pretty damn relevant, in the era of reality television where just about any person can become a celebrity for no really good reason, and fame & fortune is still seen as a worthwhile goal. Working from a screenplay by actor Buck Henry, director Gus Van Sant gives us a thoroughly absorbing film with a fair amount of ideas to mull over. Just like any good dark comedy, it's funny in a twisted sort of way. I'm sure some people who've followed the story, or read the book, or seen the movie, must know one or more people like Suzanne Stone.

An exceptional cast full of familiar faces is the real drawing card: Phoenix, Casey Affleck as his degenerate ""friend"", Alison Folland as the awkward girl who hangs out with the two of them, Dan Hedaya and Maria Tucci as Larry's parents, Kurtwood Smith and Holland Taylor as Suzannes' folks, Tim Hopper and Michael Rispoli as investigating detectives, Wayne Knight as the manager of a local TV station, and especially Illeana Douglas as Larry's sister, a cynical sort who has Suzanne pegged right early on. Making cameo appearances are author Maynard (as Suzannes' lawyer), screenwriter Henry (as a huffy teacher), and filmmaker David Cronenberg as the mysterious man at the lake. Kidman is a marvel as she really struts her stuff for the camera.

Ultimately, one does feel somewhat sorry for Jimmy when it's seen just how pathetic he really is. He's just one of many characters who get jerked around by Suzanne, a master manipulator if ever there was one.

He's urban, sophisticated and seemingly very safe since he's an art curator, or seems to be. Demi Moore as Annie Laird, a gifted and original sculptor (she sculpts works of art that you feel with your hands by reaching up into them: it's all tactile), is thrilled when he offers to buy her work and sell it to the Japanese. Wow. She has arrived as an artist.

Thus we have an intriguing and original premise for a thriller. One almost wishes that there weren't this little matter of her agreeing to serve on the jury in the case of a Mafia boss on trial for murder..

I will gloss over the excellent, if unlikely, plot since it would be preemptive to reveal any of it, and concentrate on Demi Moore who is gorgeous, strange and riveting.

It might seem impossible to give an 'heroic' performance in a thriller, since the point of a thriller is pure entertainment, but this movie manages to look into the nature of good and evil a bit more than most, and Moore plays her part like our dream of a true heroine. Her character has strength and cunning; she's sharp without pretension. I always thought Moore was better than her reputation, but somehow she always seemed a little on the not entirely bright side, the kind of actress who would never presume to play Shakespeare. But now I think she's a 'natural,' like a gifted athlete-I'd almost say an 'animal'-as an actress, which is probably why some people don't like her. She can project the beautiful woman, an ordinary woman, or herself as a matronly woman with just a turn of her head. She can display a wide range of emotions and be, by turns, both a masculine and a feminine entity; but she is not androgynous. The role she plays here is, in a sense, the feminine counterpart of many Harrison Ford roles, the ordinary person elevated to heroic action by compelling circumstances. I would not say that Demi Moore is a great actress, but she is close, and I could be wrong.

Alec Baldwin combines megalomania with a seductive cynicism. He fills the screen with his presence like something you can't get rid of. He is so compelling you want to push him away or just give up. And he is charming-evil, but charming.

Brian Gibson's direction is unobtrusive and clever, and he pays attention to detail. The script is relatively free of the implausibilities that usually mar the genre, and the editing is crisp without jarring. The story practically transcends the genre by making us feel the evil of violent crime and how it perverts society, the sort of revelation not usually attempted in a thriller. I was especially delighted to see the Mafia demeaned and defeated, even if it's only by a new breed of international criminal. This is a superior thriller.

It's a movie entirely about directing a production of ""Hamlet"". He knew his subject, at any rate ... In fact, this film is a good deal better, and certainly more heartfelt, than the ""Hamlet"" that followed it. It's hard to know why this should be. Branagh is almost invariably brilliant. His previous Shakespeare movies were the best of their kind. I presume it's more or less impossible to care about directing ""Hamlet"" without caring about ""Hamlet"" itself. Yet there we have it: Branagh's ""Hamlet"" is just a tad soulless, while his film about how to perform Hamlet in the face of overwhelming odds is heart-warming, and crackles with energy. (You'll note that there was an omen. The performance we see of ""Hamlet"" in this movie, although it moves the audience, is dreadful, and belongs to the ""let's put Shakespeare's play in any setting but the correct one"" school of thought.)

A number of people - including those I saw the film with - complain about this or that cliche. These complaints strike me as being misguided. Is it a cliche to have the production threatened? Maybe; but any movie about people fulfilling a quest would be senseless if there was no danger of them failing to fulfil it. Is it a cliche to have actors fight each other behind the scenes? In a sense; but I fail to see how any but the dullest of films could result if they didn't. In short, these kinds of complaints are complaints against the necessary mechanisms of the play about a play. If they were just they would damn everything in the entire genre. People who make such complaints MAY be saying that in this instance Branagh presented all the necessary elements without verve, or boringly, or something of that kind; but then the charge is just obviously false.

By the way ... I'd like to protest against the use of the inferior title, ""A Midwinter's Tale"", in Australia (and, I gather, in the USA). ""In the Bleak Midwinter"" says it better. I trust Branagh himself had nothing to do with the change. Branagh made this around the same time he made Hamlet, and released it just beforehand.

The lead characters are an unmarried couple, Samuel and Rebecca, who have been living together for five years. They have good careers and enjoy life together. They have frequent sex and practice contraception because they haven't wanted to have children.

They say they are in love. So far, they have liked the arrangement that might be spoiled if they were to marry. But seeing children in other families, Rebecca asks Samuel if he wouldn't like to have more in life. Samuel has been content and doesn't want to have to change. When she gets pregnant, their lives do change.

""Nine Months"" has a mixture of comedy and seriousness. But, much of the comedy and some of the dialog is crude or crass. Hugh Grant plays Samuel and Julianne Moore is Rebecca. Tom Arnold, as Marty Dwyer, is the source of much of the crudity of this film. The guy seems to play those roles mostly. What little humor he may add is lost due to his loud and crude antics and dialog. He's a brother-in-law of a mutual friend, Sean Fletcher, played by Jeff Goldblum.

The movie has a fine outcome as Samuel changes and is changed by the new life in their lives. Robin Williams has a comedy part as a Russian doctor, and he vies with Arnold for crudity with his dialog. Joan Cusack is a balancing character in the film, with some humor and sense, as Marty's wife, Gail.

This film is about finding more in life beyond the sensual pleasures which are self-centered. Rebecca wants more than that, and, in time, Samuel wants it with her. So, he sheds his selfishness. Some people really don't want more in life, so they wouldn't enjoy this type of film. As Sean says, he may wind up all alone in the end. But he'll just keep on going and adjust his attitude to take his mind off of it.

But seeing children in other families, Rebecca asks Samuel if he wouldn't like to have more in life. Samuel has been content and doesn't want to have to change. When she gets pregnant, their lives do change.

""Nine Months"" has a mixture of comedy and seriousness. But, much of the comedy and some of the dialog is crude or crass. Hugh Grant plays Samuel and Julianne Moore is Rebecca. Tom Arnold, as Marty Dwyer, is the source of much of the crudity of this film. The guy seems to play those roles mostly. What little humor he may add is lost due to his loud and crude antics and dialog. He's a brother-in-law of a mutual friend, Sean Fletcher, played by Jeff Goldblum.

The movie has a fine outcome as Samuel changes and is changed by the new life in their lives. Robin Williams has a comedy part as a Russian doctor, and he vies with Arnold for crudity with his dialog. Joan Cusack is a balancing character in the film, with some humor and sense, as Marty's wife, Gail.

This film is about finding more in life beyond the sensual pleasures which are self-centered. Rebecca wants more than that, and, in time, Samuel wants it with her. So, he sheds his selfishness. Some people really don't want more in life, so they wouldn't enjoy this type of film. As Sean says, he may wind up all alone in the end. But he'll just keep on going and adjust his attitude to take his mind off of it."

Goldberg plays a lesbian, Parker plays a straight woman with AIDS and Barrymore a pregnant, unwed woman. All three are fantastic and the film manages (more or less) to juggle many plot elements (AIDS, lesbianism, pregnancy, drugs, violence, murder etc etc) and deal with them all effectively.

Parker is probably the first woman ever to play a straight woman with AIDS in a major Hollywood film--quite a feat. Goldberg and Barrymore are just letter perfect in their roles. Also the unknown Matthew McConaughey (absolutely gorgeous with a buff body and blue eyes blazing) and Estelle Parsons (as Parker's mother) give strong supporting performances. The film is long but never dull and it all ends to a very moving final sequence--I cry every time I see it!

Two minor quibbles--it takes Barrymore over a year to have her baby and there are obvious cuts in the second half of the movie (I assume this was to keep the film down to two hours).

Of course, it would permeate the wall of the stomach to form its life sac for exchange of nutrients with the host. And so on, and so on.

And, what might the comedy be, but a male acting out nuances and reactions of a woman in pregnancy. Most viewers didn't find much humor in that - well, after the first one or two times. And the script otherwise didn't have enough comedy to overcome the unfunny weird premise.

The movie public of 1994 didn't buy it at all. The film lost several million. U. S. Ticket sales didn't even match half of the budget, and the world gross didn't even cover the film's budget -- $108 million vs $60 million. The studio gets about 50% of the ticket sales.

With a budget that size for those stars in 1994, one would guess that Emma Thompson was offered a wad to make this movie.

733,Go Fish (1994),01-Jan-1994,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"['Drama', 'Romance']"," This may be the first time you hear me say this, but Go Fish was too artistic and dated for my enjoyment. I think that if I had seen this film when it was first released back in 1994 I would have been impressed. This was a very avant-garde film that tried very hard to discuss an issue that was very ""hush-hush"" back in the early 90s. Lesbians were very closeted back then and were not a major part of the culture norm as they are today (well, as much as we recognize them today). This makes for a very provocative film, but it also makes for a very dated film. This was my biggest issue with this film was that it nearly felt like a comedy instead of this symbolic struggle to pursue happiness like any heterosexual relationship. I realize that director Rose Troche was trying to show us that a lesbian relationship is no different than a male and female relationship and even lesbians talk like men talk about women, but somehow it just felt very dated and clich√© for me. It didn't open more doors in my mind to the lifestyle of lesbians, but instead gave me this dated image of this butch lesbian that is rebelling against something instead of embracing the true lifestyle.

The black and white photography, while symbolically trying to show the black and white of the situation and relationship, just felt like an art film. This was an art film, so what am I griping about? I guess I just didn't want to see an art film with this topic. I wanted to see something along the lines of Kids or even a documentary, not something where the uneducated will laugh at and ridicule even harder. I wanted a film that was going to punch me in the face, not build upon dated/old clich√©s that instead poked my mind randomly and not very hard. It was unimpressive. It wasn't bold film-making, but instead just this random, average production about a lesbian love story. Was it to be educational? I think there were elements that could have been explored greater and into detail to cross that education/lifestyle acceptance line. The scene dealing with bisexuality is the first that comes to mind. This probably sounded great on paper, but when it was actually filmed out, it seemed high schoolish and bland. The inner voices were not struggling with the character, but instead causing confusion and chaos that will never be resolved. Another scene that could have played out just a bit better was the dinner scene where a group of lesbians have gathered for a party. There could have been more discussed between the lesbians like lifestyle, issues, and current problems (that would help with the dated feel) instead of just sex, sex, and more sex.

That was a huge downfall for me was the constant reminder that all these women wanted was to have sex. There were times when I was watching this film where I felt a bit of sweetness in my mouth because I thought there was some candy-coating happening. This does not need to happen in a film that is supposed to bring the lesbian lifestyle closer into the spotlight. I never felt that these women in this film were given the best light to show their stuff anyway. From the beginning of the first scene until the last (and all those snippets in-between) all they could talk about was sex. They wanted to have sex more often than I honestly think about in a day. It really made the rest of the non-existent themes seem blurry and unimportant. There was just a consistent lack of togetherness for this film that ultimately hurt it in the long run. This wasn't a film about women's rights, but instead a dire attempt to show the similarities between homosexual and heterosexual relationships. I agree that this happened, but just not very coherently. There seemed to be other elements strewn together in a very loose fashion that took away from the overall power of the film. Don't get me wrong, this could have been a very powerful film about a lifestyle that this world is still not accepting, but instead it went too far to the left (which isn't bad, except in this case) and chose to go the bleeding artist route instead of the informative, here are the facts route. The black and white photography, the lack of character development (who really was Ely's partner?), and the cheesy moments between scenes where women talked to me about the illusive ""honey pot"". It just wasn't coming together well for me and eventually fell apart all together.

Overall, I was not impressed. There are greater films out there that express the power of the relationship and do not create this unimpressive ""raw"" sensation by trying to shock the audiences. One of my favorites is the film Big Eden which accepts homosexuality like it is commonplace in society. If Go Fish would have been done in a similar style, I think I could have walked away from the film with a better taste in my mouth. Instead, I am stuck with an unimpressive story that did nothing except joke about why lesbian women like to play the game ""Go Fish"". Ha ha ha h¬Ö.it just isn't working for me. I do not recommend this film in the least bit. There was one, singular scene that made me chuckle and for the likes of me I cannot remember why. It was an unmemorable feast of bad cinema. Skip it.

Grade: * out of ***** This may be the first time you hear me say this, but Go Fish was too artistic and dated for my enjoyment. I think that if I had seen this film when it was first released back in 1994 I would have been impressed. This was a very avant-garde film that tried very hard to discuss an issue that was very ""hush-hush"" back in the early 90s. Lesbians were very closeted back then and were not a major part of the culture norm as they are today (well, as much as we recognize them today). This makes for a very provocative film, but it also makes for a very dated film. This was my biggest issue with this film was that it nearly felt like a comedy instead of this symbolic struggle to pursue happiness like any heterosexual relationship. I realize that director Rose Troche was trying to show us that a lesbian relationship is no different than a male and female relationship and even lesbians talk like men talk about women, but somehow it just felt very dated and clich√© for me. It didn't open more doors in my mind to the lifestyle of lesbians, but instead gave me this dated image of this butch lesbian that is rebelling against something instead of embracing the true lifestyle.

The black and white photography, while symbolically trying to show the black and white of the situation and relationship, just felt like an art film. This was an art film, so what am I griping about? I guess I just didn't want to see an art film with this topic. I wanted to see something along the lines of Kids or even a documentary, not something where the uneducated will laugh at and ridicule even harder. I wanted a film that was going to punch me in the face, not build upon dated/old clich√©s that instead poked my mind randomly and not very hard. It was unimpressive. It wasn't bold film-making, but instead just this random, average production about a lesbian love story. Was it to be educational? I think there were elements that could have been explored greater and into detail to cross that education/lifestyle acceptance line. The scene dealing with bisexuality is the first that comes to mind. This probably sounded great on paper, but when it was actually filmed out, it seemed high schoolish and bland. The inner voices were not struggling with the character, but instead causing confusion and chaos that will never be resolved. Another scene that could have played out just a bit better was the dinner scene where a group of lesbians have gathered for a party. There could have been more discussed between the lesbians like lifestyle, issues, and current problems (that would help with the dated feel) instead of just sex, sex, and more sex.

That was a huge downfall for me was the constant reminder that all these women wanted was to have sex. There were times when I was watching this film where I felt a bit of sweetness in my mouth because I thought there was some candy-coating happening. This does not need to happen in a film that is supposed to bring the lesbian lifestyle closer into the spotlight. I never felt that these women in this film were given the best light to show their stuff anyway. From the beginning of the first scene until the last (and all those snippets in-between) all they could talk about was sex. They wanted to have sex more often than I honestly think about in a day. It really made the rest of the non-existent themes seem blurry and unimportant. There was just a consistent lack of togetherness for this film that ultimately hurt it in the long run. This wasn't a film about women's rights, but instead a dire attempt to show the similarities between homosexual and heterosexual relationships. I agree that this happened, but just not very coherently. There seemed to be other elements strewn together in a very loose fashion that took away from the overall power of the film. Don't get me wrong, this could have been a very powerful film about a lifestyle that this world is still not accepting, but instead it went too far to the left (which isn't bad, except in this case) and chose to go the bleeding artist route instead of the informative, here are the facts route. The black and white photography, the lack of character development (who really was Ely's partner?), and the cheesy moments between scenes where women talked to me about the illusive ""honey pot"". It just wasn't coming together well for me and eventually fell apart all together.

734,Made in America (1993),01-Jan-1993,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Comedy']," This is the signature line of used car salesman Hal Jackson (Ted Danson) who's known for his banal T.V. ads, and whose placid, carefree life is about to be shattered by a nice girl named Zora Matthews (Nia Long), who's strong, independent mother Sara (Whoopi Goldberg) conceived her through artificial insemination after the death of her husband.

The movie opens with Zora storming out of the class room, after a blood test confirms that the man Sara was married to couldn't possibly be her father.

And after a sobbing accusation in Sara's shop (""Mom, before dad died, you had an affair!"" To which Sara's employee replies: ""Thank goodness this happened on one of MY work days!""), the truth is revealed to the agitated Zora.

Though Sara wants the matter of Zora's father closed, her daughter's curiosity is awakened.

And in the company of her friend Tea Cake Walters (Will Smith), she begins a relentless pursuit to discover the identity of her mother's donor.

When she finds Hal Jackson's name in the sperm banks computer, she is overjoyed, but there's one little problem... Hal is white.

Moreover, he has absolutely no interest in having a relationship with Zora.

But he soon finds himself having no choice, as a furious Sara (who's devastated about her child's father being white), storms in to the used car lot to yell at him, and an unlikely attraction sparks between them.

Whoopi Goldberg, and Ted Danson are terrific. I have rarely seen better chemistry between two people.

Nia Long is perfect, and Will Smith is -as always- great, as is a surprising Jennifer Tilly, who does an outstanding job as Hal's girlfriend Stacy.

This is a movie which restores one's faith in the inherent goodness of people. And in humanity as a whole.

It's a real rarity. One I hope will be appreciated as time goes on.

I thought the courtroom scenes were extremely well done except when it came time for TOM HANKS to take the witness stand. His scenes on the stand, instead of being as dramatic as the other witnesses, merely showed that he was becoming too ill to really give any insight into his character and motivations. Nothing was really revealed about the man himself.

Having said that, the other obvious weaknesses were in the script which was a little too contrived at times. Furthermore, Denzel Washington's willingness to overlook his homophobic attitudes and become a buddy to Hanks was just a little too implausible. Then too, the final hospital scene with all of the family gathered around Hanks was not quite convincing.

But credit must be given to Jonathan Demme's tasteful direction and to the very fine performances given by the large cast. Jason Robards, Jr. is a standout as the executive seeking to have Hanks dismissed. The only actor shortchanged by the script seems to be ANTONIO BANDERAS who is given little to do and does not really seem a plausible partner for the Hanks character. In other words, they have no chemistry together.

As for TOM HANKS, he surely deserved all the awards he received as the lawyer determined to find someone who will fight for his cause. DENZEL WASHINGTON is equally effective in a difficult role, demonstrating once again that he is an actor to watch as he matures with each characterization.

Absorbing all the way through--thoughtful, provocative and guaranteed to stir your interest in its delicate handling of a difficult subject.

It really is good that this movies shows both sides of the kidnap, both the little boy's (Brawley Nolte, yes, indeed the son of...) parents (Mel Gibson, Rene Russo) and the kidnappers (Gary Sinise, Lili Taylor, Liev Schreiber, Donnie Wahlberg, Evan Handler.).

The music by James Horner is good, still I'm curious about the original Howard Shore score.

Yes the movie has some good moments and is perfectly watchable but it most certainly is not Ron Howard's or Mel Gibson's best. It also is not a movie that I enjoy watching multiple times.

743,"Crow: City of Angels, The (1996)",30-Aug-1996,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"['Action', 'Thriller']"," The Crow: City of Angels is the sequel to the amazing 1994 film ""The Crow."" While in some ways it tries too hard to be like the first, the film also succeeds in other areas, such as emotion and style. While not as good as it could have been, it is still pretty enjoyable.

Story: The film begins in post-apocalyptic Los Angeles, with a grown up Sarah, who as you may recall, is the little girl from the original. She has visions of another man rising up. In comes Ashe, a single father raising a son, Danny. Ashe and Danny accidentally witness a gang attack, and therefore, are attacked and killed themselves. Guess what happens? Ashe returns from the grave to seek vengeance. One by one, Ashe hunts down those responsible for his murder, which eventually leads him to Judah, a drug kingpin and crime lord of the city. The story really focuses on Ashe's pain of losing his sun, and there are some really powerful and emotional moments in the film.

Directing: Tim Pope is an acclaimed music video director, and his knack for music videos really shines in this film. While he sets and certain mood and doesn't let it up, the movie really jumbles around in terms of style. It's like watching one huge rock video, and at time, it can be a little hard on the eyes. Most scenes were staged quite well, and other than the style, Pope did an adequate job.

Acting: Vincent Perez(Ashe) did an excellent job with his part. He had a lot to contend with, such as filling Brandon Lee's shoes. Regardless, he shined, and in his scenes of pain and grief, I really felt for him. Bravo. Mia Kirshner(Sarah) did great with what she had. I felt that the character was wasted in the film, but she did fine. Richard Brooks(Judah) played the sadistic drug-lord quite effectively, although I never really had an opinion of the character either way. That could be the fault of Brooks, the director, or the writer. I'm not sure which. Iggy Pop(Curve) overacted beyond belief, and I was quite amused.

Score: Once again Graeme Revelle proved himself an excellent composer. His music helps the mood incredibly. I only wish more of his music was in the film, and less of the hard rock.

Violence: While it is felt and implied everywhere, there really isn't tons of on screen violence, and when it was there, it wasn't overly bloody, though it had quite a brutal feel to it. The violence was in your face, and not overly entertaining or exciting like in the first film.

Profanity/Sexual Themes: Strong language throughout. The f-bomb is used all through the film. There is also a lot of S&M in the film, as well as female nudity.

Substance Abuse: The film is about a drug-lord, so, there is quite a bit of drug use in the film. Almost all the villain characters snort the coke-like drug, Trinity.

Overall: The Crow: City of Angels was a decent sequel, and really excelled in some ares, although it failed in others. If you're a fan of the first, it's worth a look. I really dug the fact that the movie was mostly about the pain of losing a loved one. It's a pretty stylish adventure. 7/10"
744,Michael Collins (1996),11-Oct-1996,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"['Drama', 'War']"," For me as a fan of Ireland, having read the history of the Irish and having visited the island several times, this is a compelling piece of contemporary history. With a cast of names, all quite a bit younger, it was nice to see it again. The film reflects the true story quite well, and is grippingly directed to boot.

Since the whole story is set in the years (1916-1922), the film doesn't seem dusty either, despite being 28 years old by now. Liam Neeson and Alan Rickman are convincing all along the line, Julia Roberts is more of a supporting character who doesn't leave a lasting impression. But it is also more about politics, patriotism and the great dream of freedom. A detailed examination of the person Michael Collins, in which the early phase of the ""IRA"" is retold with good action and archive footage worth seeing. It moved me and gave me interesting background knowledge.

Anyone interested in contemporary Irish history should not miss this highlight.

------------ Conclusion: Excellent."
745,"Ruling Class, The (1972)",01-Jan-1972,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Comedy']," A scathing and profoundly witty attack on Britain's social and political institutions with Peter O'Toole on his best ever form as Jack, the Son of an English Earl who inherits his Father's estate when the old man accidentally kills himself via auto-erotic asphyxiation. The only problem for Jack's relatives is that he's a paranoid Schziophrenic who thinks he's Jesus and they're quick to move for his indefinite committal when he starts to talk about the relinquishing of material possessions and tolerance toward all men. The Ruling Class is a film of two halves. The first is some of the best character comedy you'll ever see. As ""JC"" who wears glasses because he's cold, O'Toole commands every scene benefiting from some superbly written monologues and one liners, the standout being his pre-wedding speech on the cross and he's assisted by the creme de la creme of British character actors, Arthur Lowe a standout as the newly liberated Trokskyite Butler Tuck with a blatant contempt for his old masters. The second half however, is dark stuff indeed - jet black in fact. Apparenty 'cured' after an arranged confrontation with the AC-DC messiah, Jack dresses as a Victorian gentleman, talks about capital punishment and superior breeding and concerns no-one, the fact he believes himself to be Jack the Ripper going completely unnoticed by his peers who prime him for his climatic accession to the House of Lords. The conceit is milked for all its worth and the final scenes with a hallucinatory Jack looking at his fellow peers in the House as decayed corpses is a particularly chilling postscript to the story. Subtle? No way but its sledgehammer to the concept of patronage and privilege as a criteria for governance and influence. Like the best satire its savage, angry stuff - possibly overlong and too conscious of its theatrical origins but ultimately no less caustic or inventive for it. Class indeed."
746,Real Genius (1985),01-Jan-1985,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Comedy']," It has often been said that once you love ""Weird Science"" you'll also like ""Real Genius"". And while I guess this is true, I really wouldn't place both movies into the same category an onto the same level.

This is really a movie in the vain of other great, classic goofball '80's comedies, focusing on young students. Looking back at it, this really was the golden age for comedies and the lovers of the genre and time period will surely be able to appreciate this movie.

And I can certainly appreciate this movie as well, for what it is. That doesn't mean that I can simply ignore all of its flaws and weaknesses as well though. The movie is fun but that is about all that the movie is.

One of the things that I thought the movie was really lacking in was its story. And I'm not just talking about its main premise but more so about all of its developments, the way things progress and the characters. I guess part of this can also be blamed on the directing by Martha Coolidge, since the main premise itself remains still quite good and fun. I just could never really get involved with its story or its characters, which was a real shame, since this seemed to be what the movie was really pushing for. It wanted you to really love all of its characters and made some of them as goofy as possible.

But really the only character that truly works out and becomes a greatly fun and memorable one is the Val Kilmer character. But this in itself is still enough to make the movie a real fun and entertaining one to watch! It makes it once more obvious what a waste it is that Val Kilmer never really broke through as a comedy actor and didn't do more movies like this during his career. Most people now days only known and recognize him for his serious movie roles. In this movie he looked almost as outrageous as he does now days and that is saying a lot! Val Kilmer his look has changed very drastically over the last couple of years and with change I mean his pretty extreme sudden weight gain, while he was once a true Hollywood heartthrob.

The sort of 'childish' '80's teenage comedy approach is what makes the movie actually charming and in a way also irresistible to watch. It provides the movie with plenty of crazy situations, as well as some serious teenage issues, that still appeal and apply to teenagers this present day. This is also really what makes these genre movies from the '80's such timeless ones and are also really the reason why some of them are still being so popular to watch now days.

I would exactly classify this movie as one of the classics- or best examples for its genre but it's definitely worth giving a go.

747,Benny & Joon (1993),01-Jan-1993,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"['Comedy', 'Romance']"," Aidan Quinn is a weird character, he acts well enough in the situations where he rarely needs to be serious and acts weird and boring where the situation is troublesome. The story is very good, but the direction faltered somewhere in the middle and I lost interest in the dialogues. Dialogues is an element which makes up a lot for such movies and they were irrelevant and messy.

On the other side, Johnny Depp is an acting masterclass. He knows how to deliver words, punctuations and breaks between the words. Where the presence of Depp always shines, the presence of other two makes the screen dull, because most of the dialogues are not really like that how mentally ill people would behave. It is understandable that as the title says, Benjamin and Joon are the protagonists, then why the movie's title introduced Depp as the main character? Was it because Depp was already a popular actor back then? Still it doesn't suffice the purpose. Moreover, the chemistry of Quinn and Juliann Moore just slows down the screenplay. There should have been something strong that connects them well with the story.

There are also many scenes which are filled with music or songs in the presence of Benny and Joon and it didn't really help the screen get closer to me. A crisp writing for the mentally challenged people could have been good. Something more serious and exciting like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest might have made the story brilliant."

The way I see The Saint is much the way George Sanders and Louis Hayward interpreted him. A debonair scourge of spies and criminals, The Saint steps in where the official police are afraid to tread or unable to investigate. Now there is nothing debonair about Val Kilmer. Nothing particularly likable either -- except for the fact that he bests the villains and can run fast. I don't blame the heroine for being confused, for The Saint himself -- as presented here -- is a confusing character. The script even takes time out to let us know WHY he is confused. It all happened in his childhood, see, when he was a victimized Oliver Twist in an orphanage -- but not just an ordinary orphanage. As I pointed out in other reviews, many modern movies are determined to throw off the shackles of the past and come out fighting mad. In this case, it's the Catholic Church that gets a firm drubbing with a sadistic priest presented as a fiend from hell. These childhood episodes really have little to do with the main action but are presented mainly for their shock value. The film, which is a mite too long at 112 minutes away, would be better off without them. Introduce Kilmer right from the start and you would have a more compact, less talkative and far more suspenseful movie."

Part of what makes this film a difficult, even at times offensive experience is the way the film is more interested in white male subjectivity (should this surprise us based on the creative teams identities) over any subjective concerns about the African characters. Real hard questions need to be asked about the historical inaccuracies and distortions and how these are used to suggest that there was a much larger white reaction against slavery than really existed at the time of the rebellion. It is difficult to not compare this film to Schindler's List and to see what Spielberg can do with a film about a holocaust. The ""fictionally"" created Black abolishionist character portrayed by Morgan Freeman is so utterly under utilized and under dramatized that he could be removed entirely from the film without in any way disrupting the narrative. The actual historical facts of this fascinating rebellion and the legal struggle to free the African prisoners is so much more interesting than anything the entertainment team has come with in this horrible, offensive, mess."

You take a war plot....... with an Sylvester Stallone gun fights and you just add bond into it. Brosnan does a good job here.......... you cant notice his age and he doesn't shove the one liners down our throats like Moore. I think the bad parts of this movie were the useless henchman who gets little buildup and doesn't do anything but stand around and look tough. I hated this air thin plot because the main villain completely destroys it. The villain should do something evil or have a nice background and buildup but this villain is just irritating and boring. Michelle Yeoh is OK here but you can tell that she doesn't have any chemistry with Brosnan and you barely know what shes doing. I enjoyed the remote control car sequences (including the hilarious part with Q). The best part was the the car chase with Bond using the remote control to drive. I was a little surprised at how they changed Bond to using machine guns and killing people without a heart or hesitation. The theme song was good as were some of the action scenes, It just doesn't feel like a Bond film."

John Woo (who else?) co-produced this debut US vehicle for Asian superstar Chow Yun-fat (or 'Mr. Fat', as he's known to some careless movie fans), in which Chow plays a hired killer pursued by ruthless gangster Kenneth Tsang Kong (BISHONEN) after refusing to assassinate the family of a cop (Michael Rooker) who killed Tsang's son during a drugs bust. Mira Sorvino plays the plucky con artist hired by Chow to provide him with forged documents so he can flee the country, only to find herself caught up in Tsang's lust for vengeance, as monstrous hit men Til Schweiger (DER BEWEGTE MANN) and Danny Trejo (BLOOD IN BLOOD OUT) arrive on the scene to exterminate both Chow and his immediate family. For all its flashy visuals and explosive soundtrack, Antoine Fuqua's derivative film ploughs a well-worn furrow, slavishly imitating the Hong Kong action-thrillers which first brought Chow to Hollywood's attention, whilst completely disregarding the emotional/thematic resonance that distinguishes Asian cinema from its western counterparts. Chow is OK, as usual, but the part doesn't require him to do very much, and the entire cast (including an underused J√ºrgen Prochnow) plays second fiddle to the slam-bang pyrotechnics. Routine stuff, with few redeeming features."
753,Burnt By the Sun (1994),01-Jan-1994,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," Like most film lovers I prize invention, originality and formal daring. BURNT BY THE SUN is a very conservative historical epic, full of sweeping scenes paralelling intimate domestic exchanges; theatrical framings and acting with lots of dialogue; Jarre-esque sugary Romantic music; a fetishisation of nature.

Nevertheless, I loved this film to bits, for all these reasons. it was as rich as a novel (although it is an original), yet full of the vibrancy, life, violence, anger, and comedy absent from most literary adaptations. There is also a sense of using a cliched mode to attack its assumptions, as Chekhovian comedy turns into a denunciation of totalitarianism, and a more absurdist register.

Mikhalkov's filming of a superficially ugly Russia is lyrical and emotionally charged, and his own performance is like watching an oak tree being systematically hacked, sublime in its reach. Packed with memorable, searing set-pieces, but the filming of Marusya's confusion on Mitya's return, or his story to Nadya, shot with Nicholas Ray's feel for decor, stand out for me."

I've seen it more times than I've bothered to count, since it's on several films I have on VHS from that period(and I *love* trailers, I rarely surpass any chance to watch them). So the trailer for this film was in my mind for a long time before I realized what it was about or even what the title was. To this day, I can pretty much remember the entire trailer, despite the fact that I haven't seen it in at least three to five years. I believe this was the first place I ever saw Gere, and I know it was the first place I saw Bai. I don't know when I first saw this film, or if I did, really, before tonight. I had a feeling of deja-vu through some scenes, but if I have indeed seen this film before, it certainly can't have made much of a lasting impression on me. Whether that is the fault of the film or merely a sign of me having a quite low interest in political matters in my younger days, I leave up to debate. The plot is quite well-written, and mostly realistic and plausible, if a bit aimed at the Chinese legal system and the people in general(I realize that they and their system is a Communist one, but this does seem a tad over the top, exaggerated). The film also contains a bit too much Hollywood for an otherwise quite realistic depiction of another country's court and legal system, one that is in stark contrast to that of the American system. Some forced(granted, the chemistry is most definitely there), not to mention quite unlikely, romance, a chase scene, etc. The pacing is solid. The acting is top-notch. The writing and direction are marred by obvious sinophobia - hate and fear of China - and a lack of objectivity when dealing with this subject. The writer obviously did extensive research into the culture and court system for this film, but unfortunately, these truths are mixed with preconceptions and prejudice of said system(and possibly of the culture as well), making for a skewed perspective of the reality of the Chinese courts and prisons. The cinematography and editing are quite impressive, not too flashy but intense and effective when the occasion calls for them to be. All in all, a pretty good court-room thriller with all the elements, but the anti-Communism just seems a tad too extreme. I recommend this to fans of thrillers, Richard Gere and politically themed dramas... just watch out, or you might get caught in the maelstrom of blind hatred towards China. 7/10"
755,Jumanji (1995),01-Jan-1995,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"['Action', 'Adventure', ""Children's"", 'Fantasy', 'Sci-Fi']"," A child living in an up-and-coming town in the 1960's discovers a crate which was buried a long time ago (1869 - as established at the start of the film). Inside the crate is a board game. One night, he and his friend Sarah, start playing the board game. The board game, however, isn't all it seems to be, as the children soon learn. Allan is sucked into the board game and Sarah is chased out of the house by bats. Twenty six years things are different. The town is a run-down ghost of its previous self, the disappearance of Allan is a folklore in which his dad supposedly cut him into pieces and hid his body parts, and Sarah is a psychic with emotional issues as nobody believed what she witnessed as a child. Allan's old house has new inhabitants. Orphaned children and their aunt are moving in. The children discover the board game and start playing. Unbeknown to them, they free Allan Parrish, now, much older. They also free the board game to continue its mayhem and chaos in a jungle theme. To stop all the mayhem and chaos they must first finish the game, to finish the game they need all the players, including Sarah. All the random events that the board game throws up come face to face with modern 1990's living.

This is a great family film from the 1990's and is a lot of fun for everybody. It used special effect techniques at the time which were revolutionary but haven't aged that well. The story and plot too are a bit generic, but are by no means weak - just occasionally predictable (but hey, it's a family film, it's hardly going to randomly kill off half the cast). The casting and acting throughout was good. I'm not usually a fan of Robin Williams because I tended to find his approach a little to full-on and in-your-face, in this film however he has a wider array of emotions to show off. As well as Williams, there are stars of yester-year and the future littered amongst the scenes, notably Kirsten Dunst appears as a child actor here. It's clear to see why this was a blockbuster of its time.

Beyond the obvious situations/events on-screen which younger audiences will primarily follow, there are more subtle events unfolding which offer a lot of depth to film savvy minds; such as multiverse's, fragmented realities, time travel, butterfly effects, inanimate objects with powers. Packaged the way it is, there is something for all in this classic.

FTR, I'm watching this as an adult in 2018, prior to watching the current Jumanji film, although some of the effects in this original look a little dated, it's nothing that'll put you off. I can confidently say that almost twenty years after it was released, this film is as good as it was in the 1990's. 7 out of 10 from me, thanks for reading and enjoy"

The great thing about it is that the original cast was back so I thought this had a good chance of being as good as the first. So I watched the first Father of the Bride and really loved it, so I watched Part 2 right afterwards, I have to say this movie is a bit unbelievable. Now getting pregnant the same time as your mother, it's cool, I can believe it because my grandmother and great grandmother were both pregnant at the same time, but they didn't give birth at the same time at the same hospital. That just seemed a little too ""coincidental"" and out of the blue. But Father of the Bride Part 2 still delivers good laughs even if the plot is predictable and unbelievable.

George and the family are doing well and are just enjoying life, he's even grown to like Bryan. When Annie and Bryan come over, they announce big news that they are pregnant, everyone is so excited, except for George who has just accepted his daughter being married, now he's going to be a grandpa? But the plot thickens, Nina is pregnant too with George's baby, like mother, like daughter, and when Bryan has to go out of town for work, George has to take over, but with Franck Eggelhoffer's help, that won't be too hard.

Father of the Bride Part 2 is predictable and like I said it does get ridicules at times, but it still is a fun film for you and the family. I have to admit that the ending was very sweet, but I won't give that away, you'll have to see for yourself. Steve Martin, I felt so bad for him how hard he was trying to take care of his wife and daughter at the same time, poor guy. Franck Eggelhoffer really delivers the laughs this round, he and Steve, when George falls asleep and Annie goes into labor, Franck tries to carry George and has a hard time is so funny. Fater of the Bride Part 2 is worth the time and look, it's a cute movie over all.

The mobsters use an off-shore freighter, The Tortugo, to tap into underwater bank cables and steal millions of dollars in bank transactions. That plan falls apart when the feisty and pretty civil lawyer Kate McQueen, Cindy Crawford, got in their way and had to be eliminated in order for them to keep up their illegal activities.

Attempting to assassinate Kate at the beginning of the movie as she was jogging down swanky Ocean Drive she has Homicide Detective Max Kirpatrick, William Baldwin, assigned to be with her around the clock to watch protect and defend her, it's a real hard job but somebody's got to do it, against other attempts on her life. This gang of ex-KGB thugs really mean business as they blow up half of South Florida to get the pair, Max & Kate. As usual, in the movies, Max & Kate are always one step ahead of them and the mobsters no matter how much men and firepower as well as electronic equipment that they have are no match against the two who have almost nothing but the clothes on their back, and some times not even that, to fight them with. Far more violent then most action police movies with almost the entire cast wiped out, with the exception of Max & Kate of course, by the ending credits.

The action scenes of ""Fair Game"" are a lot like the old Saturday afternoon cliff-hangers with Max & Kate looking like they've had it and then just getting away from the bad guys every fifteen or so minutes in the movie. The bad guys are as bad as they can get in what they do and try to do, you can just imagine anyone trying to hurt or kill Cindy Crawford has to be the biggest enemy against hu-MAN-ity in history.

The last half-hour of the movie is non-stop action on the roads and highways as well as railroad trains and ships in the South Florida area with the most graphic boat sinking since, even though movie was made in 1995 but I haven't seen it until 2004, the movie ""Titanic"" in 1997.

Outlandish but at the same time ironic ending with the head gangster Kazak instead of trying to escape the sinking and exploding ship tries to punch into the ships computer the information that he needs to complete his illegal bank transaction of almost one billion dollars! All this with him knowing very well that he won't make it out alive by taking so much time doing it! It's as if Kazak just wanted to die rich."
760,Screamers (1995),01-Jan-1995,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,['Sci-Fi']," Screamers from 1995 based on the Phillip K. Dick short story ""Second Variety"" follows Hendricksson(Peter Weller) on the planet Sirius 6b, a once thriving mining operation now the setting for an uneasy standoff between two factions the Alliance and the New Economic Bloc(N.E.B.). Hendricksson has grown weary of the cold war taking a passive approach to the situation while allowing self replicating killing machines known as Screamers to bear the brunt of the burden, but when an opportunity arrives to possibly end the cold war he travels to the N.E.B. base in the hopes of kickstarting negotiations only to find that other forces are at play that pose a threat to both factions.

The movie in its opening act is terrific in setting up its world and characters on its relatively shoestring budget. Sirius 6b is a desolate wasteland where the the only inhabitants are soldiers who's only relief from the boredom are the occasional skirmishes with N.E.B. forces or screeches from the titular screamers to break up the monotony. Weller in particular does a good job as the battle weary commander Hendricksson and in the opening half of the film we get some great world building and atmosphere taking us through the desolation and ruination of this once thriving mining colony.

Unfortunately at about the half way point the movie begins to wear its influences on its sleeves as it begins to try cramming in the paranoia from John Carpenter's The Thing, the military intensity of Aliens, and even some transhumanist themes from fellow Dick adaptation Blade Runner. The second half is so chaotic and overly cluttered that it ceases feeling like its own story and instead feels like a cut and paste job of the previous 10 years worth of science fiction films. Even the design of some of the Screamers become blatantly Giger-esque not helping the Aliens comparisons.

Screamers is not a bad movie, there's genuine trade craft on display and there's clear passion in front of and behind the camera, but one can't help feeling a sense of deja vu thinking they've seen this movie before but better. It's perfectly serviceable as a rental, but you'll most likely forget having seen it in about a day."

Being the typical unmarried man, I rented ""Beautiful Girls"" because of its attractive title. I had no idea it could be so moving or endearing. I may be just getting soft, but it was one of the few films I have thought about for more than 72 hours after I saw it.

Aside from all the sexual content, swearing, etc., the dialogue between Marty (the now beautiful Natalie Portman) and Willie (my favorite actor, Timothy Hutton) is nothing short of astounding. Willie is enchanted and attracted to this little 13-year old girl next door. As they exchange more and more conversation, he realizes her great potential and even dreams about how he might just be able to wait ten years and maybe marry her.

The scene in which Willie discusses his feelings with Mo, his married friend was the turning point of the story. Willie realizes that, even if she had a love-at-first-sight crush on him, she would drift away as she matures; she would find someone closer to her own age, and Willie would become just some silly old man she met when she was young and had a ridiculous, immature attraction to. He realizes that by just being her friend, he will be able to keep her in a much more real way than if he tries to wait for her to be his lover.

But the one scene I will remember forever, the most perfect scene in the entire movie, in which the dialogue seemed neither forced nor over-elongated, was the scene in the ice-skating rink with Marty and Willie. Marty tells Willie all the things he would have liked to hear before his talk with Mo. She would marry him after they waited five years, etc. The association Willie makes with Winnie the Pooh and Christopher Robins is so beautiful it almost made me cry. (Not really, but you get the point). He gives her a good taste of reality, and she seems mature enough to understand.

In a later scene, Willie tells Marty that he would like to continue being a friend, even a mentor to her, and he has total confidence that whatever she does will be amazing.

There are about three other stories intertwined into the movie, but the Portman-Hutton line stands out as the superior.

Overall, a wonderful movie to which they should have given a title that would attract people with the ability to be moved.

P.S. The funniest part of the entire movie is the confused look Willie and Paul exchange after Mo gives unusually-phrased threats to Steven, who beat up their friend. You have to have seen the movie to understand"
763,Happy Gilmore (1996),16-Feb-1996,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Comedy']," Golf is dreadfully boring. Thankfully, films like Caddyshack and Happy Gilmore posses ambition to bring fun to the green. Both are fresh ideas that use their actors to motivate their screenplay. Unfortunately, Happy Gilmore manages to drive itself into the high grass area shortly when the game commences. Let's watch...

Happy Gilmore is often cited as ""Sandler's funniest film."" I'm not sure he has one. I recently did a fairly lengthy blog post on the subject of Sandler's films and tried my hardest to find the one that made me laugh and enjoy thoroughly. I'd probably say his best piece of work had to be Funny People. Was it funny? Not a whole lot, but it was enjoyable and a step in the right direction Sandler quickly abandoned.

The story of Happy Gilmore is simple; a loud, energetic, aspiring hockey player of the same name takes up golf when he finds out he has a powerful swing. He has serious anger management issues, and because of that, somehow, he attracts the gorgeous Julie Bowen, who plays a Public Relations Director, and also, a fellow golf player named Shooter McGavin (McDonald) who wants Gilmore off the face of the golf world.

What Gilmore desperately wants to accomplish is getting $270,000 so he can buy back his grandmother's house that was recently taken away by the IRS because of failure to meet tax payments over the last decade.

There's the setup, compiled of the obligatory sports movie and love story clich√©s, but the main problem is, well, Sandler's character. The Happy Gilmore character is odd, annoying, and aggravating. This is what you call a film's desperate attempt at comedy. Gilmore is easily fatigued, which is why his character is seriously hard to like or side with. The character gets into fights every few minutes, resulting in lame, cartoonish blows to the face and also to Sandler's personal ego.

It seems the film couldn't succeed in the writing portion and went immediately to the punching, kicking, ""things didn't go my way"" kind of slapstick. Keep in mind that if you read many of my reviews you'll know I am a fan of silly slapstick. It takes a certain mood and a very likable lead actor to pull off good slapstick. I wonder if Chris Farley could've brought more coherent likability to the Happy Gilmore character.

Also, the product placement is shamefully explicit. I'm aware it's golf, and like every other sport, is known to display product placement around the field, but when doing it in a film it appears that some of the big name companies are put in for the money - not the realism of the source material. Especially the utterly shameless marketing for Subway. Have mercy.

When compared to present day Adam Sandler, Happy Gilmore has a harmless innocence to it. It's not harmful in any way, except maybe your tolerance level. Sandler finds will be at home with this, while others will search the screenplay high and low for the real humor.

But, the film does deliver laughs, just not consistently. There's nothing more uncomfortable than watching a comedy, that is supposed to be funny, but isn't. Happy Gilmore gets laughs, but a lot of them aren't distinct in any way. I think the most memorable scene is when Bob Barker and Happy Gilmore square off on the green. I think one of Barker's lines before the scene should've been ""humor, come on down!"" Starring: Adam Sandler, Julie Bowen, Christopher McDonald, and Carl Weathers. Directed by: Dennis Dugan."

I wouldn't expect a film starring Eddie Murphy, Martin Lawrence, David Alan Grier, Halle Berry and Robin Givens to be an amusing, quirky, and well-acted film. Each of them have talent in their own right, but are normally type-cast actors who are predictable in terms of what to expect. Well Grier, Givens and Berry gave no surprises. And Martin Lawrence, though he played his role to a tee, was pretty much Martin Lawrence. The real surprise was Murphy. This is the true Eddie Murphy charisma. A character that is beyond what I would normally expect from him, this film proves that he has talent, and was pretty much the peak of his career. If for no other reason than because it's not simply another goofy comedy a la Golden Child or Coming to America. Those films are really funny, but here, Murphy proves that he can act, too...and I don't think he's ever done it again. The problems with this film were few. The supporting cast were fairly strong...even though some were quite predictable in terms of character, they still worked out well. Robin Givens was a bit one-dimensional, but she served her purpose well. David Alan Grier was a weakness; he went overboard in this role; he played the same role in a much stronger manner (also opposite Halle Berry) in Strictly Business. And the smaller roles were all amusing: Grace Jones was hilarious, especially the restaurant scene! Leonard Jackson's facial expressions were priceless, John Witherspoon was great (as was the whole Thanksgiving dinner!!) and Geoffrey Holder was funny and charismatic as the quirky commercial designer, Nelson. So what were the problems? Well the length was an issue. This film could've been 20-30 minutes shorter; two hours is just too much. Start by cutting out the sex scenes, they were yawnable and pretty much useless. Look It's Robin Givens in her panties. Look it's Robin Givens in her panties again. And guess what? Yup, three time's the charm, Robin Givens in her panties once again...granted, Robin Givens is quite the looker, but not on top of Eddie Murphy. And this film really didn't need it. While we're at it, you can take out the whole Eartha Kitt-Eddie Murphy seduction scene. Could have been done in a quarter of the time, and frankly the whole scene still makes me shudder;) As well, the cinematography was poor, with generic shots an choppy cuts (and worse fades). Now, I don't expect art-school experimentation, nor do I expect Coen Brothers quality, but they could've at least made it look pretty. The scenes are nice, but they do nothing with them. This is textbook film-making. All in all, the film is a fun watch. The scenes that are on are *really* on; absolutely hilarious. As it is the film's quite good. Cut out even fifteen minutes and the film would be so much better! 7/10"

Despite hospital care she begins to change and have strange desires. With her desires controlling her turns to Peina for help.

A sister film in that both film share a crew, a writer and some of the cast. The genres are very different but the themes are the same ¬ñ religion and redemption. The vampire thing isn't played like it usually is ¬ñ stakes through the heart etc, these are mentioned but not laboured. Instead the story is about the origins of sin and the extent it controls us and how we can be redeemed. It cleverly uses the vampire myth as an allegory for wider human evil ¬ñ `We are not sinners because we sin, we sin because we are sinners. We aren't evil because we do evil, we do evil because we are evil'.

At times it gets a little heavy ¬ñ the ending in particular takes some interpretation and the message can be easily misunderstood. However ignoring the message this also stands up as a great vampire film ¬ñ the party which turns into a massacre is as good (if not better) then the nightclub opening of Blade, and much more meaningful to boot. Ferrara is a master director who has never followed the money to blockbusters ¬ñ here he is in total control of his themes and the film rarely loses focus. His clever use of music is also good ¬ñ a blend of all styles. The theme song feels like it's going to be a 1980's romantic comedy, but this blends straight into hip-hop and others to create a mix that never feels strange ¬ñ in fact a baseline seems to run under the whole film like a heartbeat.

Lili Taylor is on top form as Conklin and commands attention the whole time. Walken and Sciorra are both good but have less screen time than in the Funeral, however here, as there, they have key lines of dialogue that carry tremendous weight. Sopranos co-stars Falco and Imperioli are both good but are no more than bit players. The real stars are Ferrara and writer Nicolas St John, who wrote this and The Funeral after the death of his son.

Overall this is a great film that serves up more for thought than for action. To this end it won't please those expecting a Blade style vampire film but to fans of Ferrara used to his themes this will be very enjoyable."

Not if there is the ghostly inhabitants of Whipstaff Manor in Friendship, Maine! This desolate mansion is then, in the words of one of the members of the Ghostly Trio of Whipstaff, 'intruded' by Kat Harvey (Christina Ricci) and her eccentric father Dr. James Harvey (Bill Pullman), a ghost therapist. Carrigan Crittenden (Cathy Moriarty) had hired Dr. Harvey to exorcise the ghosts, including Casper the friendly ghost and his three obnoxious uncles, Stretch, Fatso and Stinkie, aspiring to gain Whipstaff's 'buried gold'.

'Casper' is recommended for any audience, regardless of age.

It was only afterwards did I realise how much other people (and when I say 'other people' I generally mean the critics!) absolutely hated it. And, although I obviously don't agree, I can see why - from a certain point of view.

In 1993 'Jurassic Park' was epically adapted from a Michael Crichton novel and... well, the Box Office and impact on films and popular culture spoke for itself. Therefore, when 'Congo' was pitched from another Crichton novel, it was 'sold' to the masses as 'Jurassic Park with gorillas.' Yes, if you saw any of the trailers or marketing material around the time of its release, you'd get the impression the human stars were going to be going up against hordes of savage, mutated gorillas in the jungle. And, although that does happen, it can hardly be described as the 'main' portion of the film. In fact... would it be a 'spoiler' to say that the 'bad gorillas' only come into the story in the final act?

What 'Congo' is about is a bit of a 'mish-mash.' You have a scientist (Dylan Walsh) who's trained a gorilla to use sign language and to 'speak' through the help of a virtual-reality glove, returning her to the film (in the 'Congo' - surprise!), teaming up with an ex CIA operative (Laura Linney) who's looking for her ex fianc√© because he disappeared while searching for a new form of diamond for a telecommunications company. Throw in an eccentric Hungarian (Tim Curry) who's looking for a lost city in the jungle and a suave British local guide (Ernie Hudson) and you generally have a lot going on. Is it any wonder that the film-makers simple figured it would be easier just to sell it as 'Jurassic Park with gorillas?'

However, despite having a lot to cover plot-wise, it's actually pretty good. It's not so much about 'man versus mutant gorilla,' rather the group versus everything you'd expect (and more!) to find in that area of the world. You have the local tribes, the harsh elements, corrupt military and hungry, hungry hippos (yes, seriously). First of all, it's an adventure film. The bad gorillas are simply one part of a much bigger film.

It's no dramatic masterpiece. In fact, Laura Linney and Dylan Walsh are two pretty uninspiring leads. The true outstanding performances come from Ernie Hudson and Tim Curry who - probably - should have been the two leads as their bantering and performances is what makes the film (in terms of human leads).

The other notable 'cast members' are the gorillas themselves. Although computer effects did wonders at bringing dinosaurs back a few years earlier, the technology still wasn't there to make furry gorillas look realistic, so animatronics and practical effects were used instead. These were masterminded by Stan Winston and, although they aren't perfect, they are as pretty close to holding up today as any film made in 1995.

If you're expecting a wall-to-wall action film where man must survive against great big, nasty gorillas who are picking them off one by one, then you won't find it here. If, however, you're looking for a good old fashioned action/adventure film that could be watched by all the family on a Saturday afternoon, then this will certainly kill a couple of hours."

Noir takes on a double meaning (naughty pun) as WWII vet turned private eye Ezekial ""Easy"" Rawlins (Denzel Washington) finds himself mired in the quick sands of corruption, coersion and murder most foul after taking on a job that's led him straight to the dirtiest little secret in town. After he accepts a missing persons inquiry from mysterious DeWitt Allbright (Tom Sizemore, first shady and then downright scary when we see what he's really about), he finds himself searching for a girl named Daphne (Jennifer Beals) a runaway with ties to a very powerful politician (Maury Chaykin makes your skin creep and crawl) with some seriously disturbing extra curricular activities. Rawlins recognizes danger when he sees it and tries to back out, but by then he knows too much and it's way late in the game. Now he must navigate the scene like the pro he to escape not only with answers, but perhaps his life. Washington gives him the underdog treatment, a worn out gumshoe who still has some grit left, enough for one last ride in any case. There's an L.A. Confidential type feel to the plot in the sense that it ducks some conventions in order to service true surprise from its audience. Sizemore is a charming viper as the kind of dude you never want to trust (isn't he just the best at playing that?) and Beals subverts the damsel in distress archetype by injecting her performance with a jolt of poison. In terms of L.A. noir this baby is fairly overlooked, but holds its own to this day. Watch for Don Cheadle as well."

772,Kids (1995),01-Jan-1995,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," There are two highly, and deservedly, controversial movies dealing with the issues of drug and alcohol abuse, underage sex, lack of control, and the preteen and teenage minority of urban America. One of them is ""Kids"" and the other is ""Bully."" The former is a haunting work of art; the latter is a clunk of garbage. Both were directed by the same man, Larry Clark. I saw ""Bully"" first about a year ago and I was blown out of my mind by how offensive and atrociously cruel that movie was and how it redeemed itself in no way. I initially condemned Mr. Clark as a director and vowed never to see another movie of his again.

Then I happened to see the Siskel & Ebert review for his first movie ""Kids"" and after much deliberation, decided to give this controversial filmmaker a second chance. I am so glad that I did.

In many respects, ""Kids"" and ""Bully"" are much the same movie. They're both frighteningly brutal, appalling in their explicit content and vulgar dialogue, and they expose the nasty undercurrents in the younger generations of today, especially in urban cities where parental control (or control of any kind) seems all but present. So why is ""Kids"" a great movie and ""Bully"" an awful one? Because while ""Bully"" only pretended to have a purpose, ""Kids"" *has* a purpose and it never once dumbs down on that. It's a sick and disgusting picture, but it's also somewhat of a wake-up call. And I can fairly say now that as a reviewer and film-goer, I can forgive Mr. Clark.

""Kids"" is set in the drug-riddled streets of New York. We see very little of parents, or adults for that matter, and focus on a group of rambunctious, vulgarity-spitting, lecherous teenagers who are devoted to getting drunk, abusing drugs, and giving away their virginity. The most sickening of them is Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick). Not because he can charm young girls enough to seduce them into deflowering them, but because he's simultaneously signing their death warrants with the HIV virus. One of his victims (Chloe Sevigny) discovers she has AIDS because of her one-night stand with him and as she slowly suffers, searches the city to confront him. Meanwhile, Telly is trying to seduce his next victim while he and a group of other nasty individuals roam unsupervised through a place as horrific as any drug underworld. More shocking is that this is just a day in the life for them.

Even more shocking is the daunting realization that this is one hundred percent accurate and we must commend Mr. Clark and screenwriter Harmony Korine, the latter in particular. His screenplay is the core of why this picture is so powerful. He writes his dialogue without any apparent flow or structure, as if the behavior of his characters are not even up to him. The actions of the characters are unpredictable, as they would be. I also really commend him for his choice to not close up with an obligating-style ending, but to choose a really haunting, crusher of one instead. And Mr. Clark shoots his film in a strong, visual-focused documentary approach with long takes from his camera swinging back and forth between the gossiping teenagers. He also pays good attention to their surroundings, showing the conditions and lack of concern from their peers and elders that resulted in their being this way. Because he has a screenplay that is focused and sharp (""Bully"" did not) his movie has a purpose and even his seemingly pornographic shots have a purpose as well.

The content is oftentimes appalling, but it also has a purpose. This time I must appreciate Mr. Clark's boldness and reluctance to be contrived. Whereas I got the sense he was indulging the drug use and sex in ""Bully,"" here he clearly defines his intentions of turning our stomachs. These particular kids are scum and they are a product of their scummy environment. He wants to show us that. So the scenes of underage sex are jaw-dropping. They do not turn on the audience; they appall. Furthermore, he does not flood the screen with images of naked teenage bodies and relies on our imagination at crucial moments to exploit the real horror. He balances the explicit and implicit with professional craftsmanship.

""Kids"" is a very tough movie to watch and tough to enjoy, but I must confess that it is, to my mind, a truly great film. As I sat there watching it, I was appalled and disgusting and flabbergasted, but at the same time, I was drawn in. Mr. Clark's brilliant portrait of the bad side of humanity in our younger generation grips you by the throat and he never lets go. Not once. He's also got some very strong performances from his cast which include Leo Fitzpatrick, a very young Rosario Dawson, Chloe Sevingy, and the late Justin Pierce whose brilliant performance reminds me so much of the scumbags that I had the displeasure to know in my adolescent years. I personally managed to avoid their paths of life and now looking at ""Kids,"" I am even more thankful that I did."
773,Mute Witness (1994),01-Jan-1994,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,['Thriller']," At first this movie really had my full attention. I'm not saying this was an original movie, like I had never seen before, but it sure had something to offer that really appealed to me. It's a pity that it all went wrong in the second half of the movie.

Billy Hughes is a mute make-up artist who works on an American slasher movie that's being shot in Moscow. One fine evening she witnesses the making of a snuff movie in the studio where her crew works. Now she has to try to escape from the murderers (Russian people who work in her film crew), to stay alive and to convince the authorities that the murder that she witnessed is real.

I like to watch good thrillers and I'm a fan of European movies, because most of the time they pay more attention to the character development and the story. Even though this movie sometimes reminds me of a Hitchcock movie and even though it has a European cast and director, it can't convince me all that much. It has some good potential, but somehow they have messed it up and made it look like a mediocre Hollywood movie. The story is quite original, the locations are nice, but it is the acting that doesn't always do the trick. I'm not saying the actors are bad, but they aren't great either. I guess there are people who really love this movie, but I'm certainly not one of them. I give it a 5/10."

It features some truly zany scenes, usually involving 'good' angel Eric Stoltz fighting against the forces of evil, and a stand-out performance from Christopher Walken who toplines as the angel Gabriel.

Walken is one weird guy, and he's never been weirder than in this film. Writer/director Gregory Widen gives Walken some great dialogue to play with, which adds immeasurably to the fun. The storyline is all over the place really, mixing in some police procedural stuff with De Niro-lookalike cop Elias Koteas, a cameo for Lucifer himself (Viggo Mortensen, raising his profile) and a superfluous appearance for CANDYMAN's Virginia Madsen.

Despite the film's sometimes slightly aimless feel, for the most part it works. The storyline is punctuated by moments of creepiness and graphic violence and for the most part it feels fresh and original. In fact, it did so well that sequels followed..."

The casting by Marion Dougherty is brilliant. Mother/Julia Roberts; daughter /Brett Cullen; and sister/Kyra Sedgwick have the same speech pattern and same lips! There is something about their mouths that makes them really match. The cast is full of pros: Dennis Quaid (The League), Gena Rowlands (Hope Floats), and one of my favorites Robert Duvall (Wrestling Ernest Hemingway, The Apostle). He is of the top actors of the American Cinema, Oscar winner and many times nominated for all the prestigious awards available.Two treasures! Dennis Quaid and Robert Duvall. They can surely transform themselves! Eddie Bichon, played by Dennis Quaid, is cheating in his wife and she raises an uproar. She gets the entire family, friends and town are all involved, and Grace makes a point of going out of her way to spread the news of who is cheating and with whom. The movie gets funny as Grace takes vengeance at her own hands including giving Eddie a near death experience with her special chemistry in cooking helped by a special recipe from her Aunt. Kyra Sedwick (Singles, Phenomenon) has so many funny lines. She is my favorite character in this movie. Kyra Sedwick was nominated for Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture for this part. I think that those supporting roles are really good and many times the actor can explore his or her craft more than the actor who has the lead. I have the tape and enjoy watching it. I love: the customs, the stable, horses, and equine competition atmosphere in the movie.

My favorite line: ""Sometimes a near death experience helps to keep things in perspective"" Emma Rae is in bed almost falling asleep: Grace ""Are you up?"". Emma Rae: "" Not technically!"" My favorite Scene: Emma Rae kicking her brother -in -law after she helped him to come in the second floor of the house through the window. Nice looking movie! Good for the eyes! Full of fine lines!"
776,Three Wishes (1995),01-Jan-1995,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," This movie is better than the rating suggests. Patrick Swayze displays some tremendous acting skills as the ever blue Jack McCloud, a tramp and thorough loner. He is sincere and pervasive, as is Joseph Mazzello as Tom. The evolving relationship between the two of them is one of the three major themes of the movie. It is a relationship propelled by Tom's dear wish to have some male person around he can relate to and rely on, as his father is apparently absent. Jack, who joins the family as a stranger, develops a kind of deep and caring commitment towards the three family members. He doesn't push for it, it just happens. The second theme focuses around M.E. Mastrantonio's brilliant performance as Jeanne Holman, Tom's and Gunny's mom. Her despair mingled with hope and confidence makes her the archetype of the single parent of the Mid-50s, the era which is so superbly revived as the movie's setting. The third theme centers around Gunny, Tom's little brother, his belief in magic and fairies as well as his fears. This is the movie's underlying main theme, as the title itself suggests. The end, which makes you feel good and renews faith in what we have and ought to preserve and care for, reveals the message of the title and grants this movie an inspiring and deeply human message. Magic is out there - in everything we do and everything we dream of. It is the little things, the little signs of love and affection, of hope and endurance. Tom himself, as an adult, receives reassurance in his faith and his values by what Jack has done to his family when he was a young boy. The message is brilliant and makes this movie a solid 8/10. ""Be yourself"", Jack advises Tom. ""And be happy with what you have"" he adds much later in the movie. Hope and love will endure against all odds, if we allow magic into our lives. The same magic we believed in as kids. It is still there. You just have to admit it."
777,Castle Freak (1995),01-Jan-1995,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Horror']," John (Jeffrey Combs) and Susan Reilly (Barbara Crampton) are a married couple going through some very dark times. She blames him for the fatal car crash that blinded their teen aged daughter Rebecca (Jessica Dollarhide) and killed their younger child J.J. (Alessandro Sebastian Satta). Now, years later, John learns that he has inherited a 12th century Italian castle. They come to do some inventory (John really just wants to sell the place) and do a little exploring. What they discover is that the castle also comes with a secret: a monster, Giorgio (Jonathan Fuller) residing in the lower levels.

What gives ""Castle Freak"" an edge over similar horror product is the overwhelming feeling of tragedy. A pall hangs over this whole film; one has to wonder if this family is ever going to be happy again. Giorgio, too, comes with his own desperately unhappy back story. As is the case with many a movie monster, he's quite pitiable as well as hideous. Fuller is excellent in the role. As often as he creeps you out, he earns your sympathies.

While Combs does tend to get his due as a truly talented actor, this viewer would have to point to ""Castle Freak"" as a solid example of just how good Crampton is as an actress. She's more than just a pretty face. The dramatic tension between John and Susan is palpable. Dollarhide, too, is very good, delivering a sensitive and vulnerable performance. It's somewhat wearying that Susan keeps automatically dismissing Rebeccas' insistence of the other presence in the castle. Stubborn characters can be hard to deal with in this or any other genre.

Director Stuart Gordon and his largely Italian crew create vivid atmosphere. They mostly try to avoid bright colours. In fact, this is one of those instances where it feels like the filmmakers tried to create a slightly colourized version of a black & white movie. The makeup effects by Optic Nerve are impressive, and Richard Bands' music is excellent.

""Castle Freak"" definitely deserves a wider audience. It's a serious, somber story where one does get emotionally invested in these characters.

Inspired by, rather than officially based on, the H.P. Lovecraft tale ""The Outsider"".

778,Don Juan DeMarco (1995),01-Jan-1995,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance']"," DON JUAN DEMARCO lives in the comedy section at my local Blockbuster. I suppose that is the best place for it; it does not suffer under the weight of its psychiatric-evaluation plot device, is exultant and exhilarating, and includes some truly laugh out loud funny lines.

For the most part, though, DJDM is a romantic fable with lessons not just for men (about how to seduce a woman touching nothing but her hand, for example), but for women as well (about how romance can exist in our everyday lives, even if we never encounter Don Juan).

Johnny Depp plays Don Juan DeMarco, the world's greatest lover - a 21 year old man in Queens, NY when we meet him. He has nothing left to live for and climbs to the top of a billboard to await a worthy adversary who will end

his life. Instead, he gets a somnambulistic psychiatrist on the verge of retirement (Marlon Brando), who convinces him to come down and promptly commits him for observation.

In tone, the film is similar to CHOCOLAT (which also stats Depp) and LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE; its environment of a psychiatric hospital where the young Don Juan must prove his sanity reminds me of the grandfather in A PRINCESS BRIDE. It gives us a point of reference in our own world and prevents the unbridled romanticism of Don Juan's monologues from getting out of hand.

No man other than Depp could sit squarely in this modern-world fishbowl and deliver the lines of Don Juan. He insisted on working with Brando on the film, but he outshines the cinema icon in every shared shot. His physical beauty is less important than his utter sincerity - a sincerity so convincing that even my ""I hate chick flicks"" husband can watch with a straight face and come away in a better mood.

As Don Juan says, ""there are only four questions of value in life: What is sacred? Of what is the spirit made? What is worth living for? What is worth dying for?"" By the end of the film, he has proven his point: ""the answer to each is the same - only love."" Not that the story answers all of its own questions...

Is Don Juan a pathological liar and a schizophrenic? Is he troubled but sincere? Does Brando's Dr. Mickler really get conflicting evidence from Don Juan's family, or has he slipped into a daydream fueled by his desire to recapture the part of himself Don Juan represents? No matter how many times I see the film, I end up believing *in* Don Juan, even if I do not *believe* him.

DJDM gets a 7 in spite of being one of my favorite films. The reason: Brando can be nearly intolerable at times, but Depp picks up his slack. Highly recommended to romantics of all ages - one of the sexiest movies in my collection, despite its PG rating."

Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels team up as the not just odd, but strange, weird and mentally disabled couple.

After losing both of their jobs on the same day, Lloyd (Carrey), who retrieved a bag which a woman he drove to the airport leaves in the terminal, encourages his friend Harry to come with him to Aspen where the girl flew to. They think that the gas company is after them since they didn't pay their bill, but is actually the kidnappers of Mary (Holly)'s husband, who were supposed to pick up the money where she left it in the airport terminal.

From their start in Rhode Island, until they arrive in Aspen, the kidnappers follow Harry (Daniels)and Lloyd, along the road. The script is the most well-written comedy I think ever, because every thing that they do in the movie, leads to something new and funny that ends up happening to them later on.

Their are more than a few funny scenes, and the dialogue is always right-on.

I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Farrley Brothers' movies, or anyone who likes Jim Carrey. It's a hilarious comedy and the two stars were perfectly casted, especially Jim Carrey, of course.

A flustered Meg Ryan is fun. A fake French Kevin Kline is not. The fake French accent gets annoying. She has a short haircut and her character at the start doesn't fit. Their chemistry is not quite right but it is still Meg Ryan with Kevin Kline. They are apart too much but they have some fun moments together. Meg Ryan maintains her adorable quotient with a bit too much wackiness. The humor is a bit too broad.

I was also asked whether I was ever involved in the Russian mafia. I answered ""no"" to both questions. It was true I had never seen the film, nor had I ever been involved with Russian organized crime. I was a first-generation American, who because of my parents and grandparents was able to speak Russian, and my family's hopes of achieving the ""American Dream"" rested firmly on my shoulders. The man who had asked me these questions was an accomplished educator, who had even once been invited to the Oval Office. He was always borderline derisive of me and I felt that he had seen me as a stereotypical ""Russian mobster in the making."" It was years later when I finally watched the film and I was fuming. I want to convey several issues to Americans about this film. The most important issue is that crime exists everywhere, but Brighton Beach is not controlled by the Russian Mafia. There is barely any presence of Russian organized crime, and most residents have vaguely heard or interacted with these elements. The protagonist of the film, a Russian Jewish hit-man who fled Brighton Beach to evade the ire of the Russian Mafia, was a plot-driven character who did not even slightly resemble any of the young immigrants who arrived to Brighton Beach during the 1970's and 1980's. Joshua Shapira was as realistic as Peter Pan. Second, the elderly generation was poorly portrayed in this film. It was filmed in 1993 and Jacob's 80-year-old grandmother was James Gray's idea of an ""off-the-boat"" immigrant. I almost laughed at how the grandmother only spoke Yiddish and was an ""old world"" zombie. That is absolute nonsense. It is true that that generation could speak Yiddish, but they in fact spoke Russian much more frequently and were quite cognizant of history, politics, and current events. That generation, my grandparents, attended English courses for immigrants and were able to converse in basic English. I will admit that not all could do this. Some still had to work, while others had to babysit their grandchildren. My point is that the grandmother in this film, an ""Old World"" Yiddish-only zombie, was not in any way, shape, or form similar to the grandparents of the Soviet Jewish immigration. My grandfather, who recently passed away, spoke Yiddish, Russian, and rudimentary English (because he worked in this country for many years). He also was always mindful of American and world politics. The portrayal of grandparents in this movie was ridiculous and unrealistic. For example, on my way to the Brighton Beach library I remember overhearing two World War 2 generation Soviet immigrants discussing Hillary Clinton's first international tour as Secretary of State in 2009. The baby boomers, who are grandparents today on Brighton Beach, can speak English proficiently and are quite Americanized. Third, the mother suffering from cancer at home and implicitly unable to get medical care because she is an immigrant is absurd. The United States fully provided medical care and support to the underprivileged. If the Shapiro family were in fact as poor as the family portrays, she would had been able to receive Medicaid/Medicare benefits and the government would have paid for her treatments. It was a sinister exaggeration that the poor immigrant suffering from cancer had to die at home and implicitly the reason was because of her ""impoverished immigrant status."" Absolutely bogus. She would have been provided full medical benefits and not suffer at home like portrayed in the film. Fourth, the father in the film was the stereotypical ""Soviet dictator"" parent who was domineering, abusive, and emotionless. The character was just a plot-driven element of the film not remotely similar to any of the Soviet Jewish immigrants who had supported their children, who were either born in the USA or arrived as young children. He was clearly the antagonist of the film, and when the accomplished educator I had mentioned earlier spoke to me about Brighton Beach, I distinctly remember him asking what my father was like. I can assure you that 99% of the Soviet Jewish parents were not Stalin-like brutes. They, in fact, were completely supportive because they wanted their kids to be successful Americans. The father in this film, who dressed like they did at the turn of the century and not the 1990's and stood on Brighton Beach at night with others drinking Vodka with prostitutes, was nowhere close to any reasonable behavior or individual I have encountered on Brighton Beach. The father was an absurd character created by a warped view of what a Soviet immigrant patriarch would be like. I won't spoil the ending for those who haven't seen it, but as the entire movie suggests Brighton Beach is a dark world full of crime, sadness, and tragedy. False. False. False. New Yorkers from all five boroughs travel to the beach and boardwalk during the warmer months, and Brighton Beach is full of restaurants, Sushi bars, and Russian nightclubs. I cannot explain to you how ridiculous it was when Joshua in the end sat in his car alone thinking about all the tragic events during the film. Even when this was filmed in 1993, the movie was a terrible and inaccurate portrayal of Brighton Beach and the Soviet Jewish immigrants who inhabit it. I can tell you that the Soviet Jewish immigrants who arrived when they were young and first-generation Americans who were born here did not live in ""Little Odessa"" and were not inclined to a life of crime. Education, hard work, and successful careers are the attributes of those who inhabit Brighton Beach and this movie was complete fiction in its portrayal of the older immigrants, younger immigrants, and first-generation Americans."
783,Milk Money (1994),01-Jan-1994,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"['Comedy', 'Romance']"," Three near pubescent boys Brad (Adam LaVorgna), Frank (Michael Patrick Carter) and Kevin (Brian Christopher) decide to satisfy their burgeoning curiosity of the opposite sex by pooling their money together and buying a prostitute to see naked. Their ill advised venture to the city leads them into danger almost immediately until they are saved by hooker named 'V' (Melanie Griffith) and the boys convince her to accept their transaction. V gives the boys a lift home after their bikes are stolen using her pimp's car. When the car breaks down Frank offers to let V live in his treehouse until it's fixed hoping to set her up with his widowed father, Tom (Ed Harris), a science teacher engaged in a fight to save the local wetlands. When V's pimp turns up dead as a result of money stolen from his boss Waltzer (Malcolm McDowell) V's big city life clashes with the uptight suburbia in which she's taken refuge.

Released in 1994, the initial sale of the screenplay by John Mattson was considered such a hot commodity that Paramount paid $1.1 million for the script leading to a lawsuit against Mattson for violation of a verbal agreement with the Dino De Laurentis. When the movie was released the film was a bomb released in the late August dumping ground not even recouping its $20 million budget and made multiple critics ""Worst of '94"" lists including Siskel and Ebert (with Ebert's newspaper review not even being a review but a satirical conversation between two fictitious executives who greenlit the movie). All these years later and the movie is still as awful as it was when first released.

The movie is multiple movie really, it's a coming of age story about boys discovering their sexuality, it's a romantic comedy, it's a crime comedy, and it's a Home Alone style kid shenanigans movie all rolled into one, and surprise surprise it doesn't do ANY of those elements well.

The movie's kid characters are written like gimmicky TGIF sitcom characters with each one being an exaggerated ""Type"". Brad is the ""cool"" one with his preening looks, leather jacket, and combed hair that seems like it's trying to evoke the antiquated image of James Dean, Kevin is an uptight neurotic neatfreak, and Frank is a mixture of a wisecracker and an innocent. Frank is massively inconsistent in the movie being a pranking schemer when the script calls for it, and being cloyingly ""cute"" when the situation calls for it. None of these kids act like real kids and they exist more as excuses for lame jokes are idiotic decisions to move the plot forward. One point of massive stupidity happens early on in the film where the kids travel to ""The City""(never identified by name) and start asking random women if they're prostitutes, when this fails a scuzzy man in a trenchcoat who sees the boys flashing the cash around is able to convince them to come with him to a secluded alleyway because if our characters had a pair of braincells between them there wouldn't be a movie. Even in the impetus for the boys' excursion to find a prostitute to see naked seems rather pointless because we see the boys have access to pornographic VHS tapes and magazines and there's really no rhyme or reason as to why they're doing this.

Things don't improve when V enters the picture, V is the textbook manic pixie dream girl fantasy to a ""T"" with her presence in the film feeling tinkerbellish against the Norman Rockwell by way of Andy Griffith town of Middleton that's so painfully scrubbed clean it makes Main Street USA look like Cabrini Green. The movie has this quasi 50s attitude with its quaint small town that wouldn't feel too far removed from a 50s sitcom like Father Knows Best. Everything about this town from the social attitudes to the behavior of the citizens feels like it's several decades removed from present day. V colliding with suburbia is a large part of the humor in this movie and it feels so artificial and phony because no one acts like a human being. The characters aren't so much characters as they are broad stereotypes and caricatures who are basically there to give one note reactions and overdone catchphrases as ""Jokes"", one scene repeats the dialogue ""That is Bad. That is Very. Very. Bad"" 3 times over the course of five minutes. Even the ""meet cute"" between Frank's father, Tom and V is such a hackneyed misunderstanding filled with unintentional double meanings with a sexual slant that it just makes you cringe watching it. I didn't laugh once at this movie, and more often than not I was groaning, cringing, or some combination of both. Scenes like where V has the boy's lift their shirts over their heads to see if they're ""not harry enough to be dangerous"" or the scene where they go to V's apartment to see her topless are just so unintentionally creepy and their sitcom presentation coupled with very bouncy shenanigans music only makes them worse.

When I was watching this film, I repeatedly asked myself ""Who was this made for?"" with all the sexual themes, innuendos, and a character who's a hooker it's way too outside of acceptable for a general family orientated comedy, but other scenes with kid shenanigans where they talk about farts, barf, or mistake feminine care items for weapons (yes, seriously) play to such a young audience that even Nickelodeon would see these jokes as beneath them. There's also a subplot with Tom trying to save some wetlands and I have no earthly idea why it's in the movie, it's barely a footnote all things considered and the movie doesn't establish anything about them other than they're important to Tom. The movie is basically Pretty Woman by way of a car crash with one of Chris Columbus' family dramedies and they just don't mesh well. Pretty Woman even though there's certainly a Cinderella type fantasy element to the story had a level of credibility to it because it was willing to look at the seamier side of its subject matter (The attempted rape by Jason Alexander's character is still a really well done scene). Chris Columbus movies aren't designed to tackle these kinds of issues and the fact they've built a movie tonally similar to Mrs. Doubtfire around a subject matter like this just shows a complete lack of awareness.

Milk Money is just junk. It's an ill advised attempt to take two popular film tends (Pretty Woman and Chris Columbus movies) and try to mix them together and we're given a mess. The movie doesn't work as a comedy because it tackles a taboo subject mater with a bubbly airheaded delivery more appropriate for a family sitcom, it doesn't work as a romantic comedy because it has dumb characters acting out an unbelievable premise, and it doesn't work as a coming of age story because there's no attempt at actually understanding a child discovering their sexuality and it's instead used as a lame excuse for catch phrases and awkward humor. It's a movie that alternates between tired jokes and cringe inducing situations and is easily one of the worst mainstream films of the 90s."

Nevertheless, Big Tom is taking out new loans to start up a new brake pad factory and marrying Beverly (Bo Derek). Beverly's son Paul (Rob Lowe) is a jerk. Big Tom puts resentful Richard Hayden (David Spade) in charge of looking after Tommy. Tommy reconnects with former schoolmate and shipping manager Michelle Brock (Julie Warner).

Chris Farley is naturally adorable and a great physical comic. He exudes charm. David Spade is his perfect partner with his sarcastic superior manner. The movie excels when the duo is on the screen together. It doesn't work quite as well without both guys together. They are simply a hilarious team."

I didn't like the casting choices at all. None of the actresses (and actors) in this movie match the description of their characters in the books. However, the cast of the video series is more faithful to the books.

The movie, while fun, is very stockish and predictable. There isn't much focus on the kids, either! Sure, we get a glimpse of a child here and there (Jackie Rodowsky is no where near a Walking Disaster in the film), but the primary plot centers on Kristy Thomas.

It's too bad that the character of Jessi was horribly underwritten. I'd hate to think that the screenwriter deliberately reduced her to token black person status, but that's pretty much the way Jessi comes across in the film. She only has a few lines to say, and most of them are pretty stupid.

The only performances I did enjoy were those of Elizabeth and Watson (Kristy's mother and stepfather).

All in all, viewers who are just looking for some mindless entertainment might get some enjoyment out of this film. However, fans of the BSC books and videos would probably be disappointed unless they aren't looking for a faithful adaptation."

Palminteri, as ""Cheech,"" was great to watch in this film.

Unfortunately, his other two costars were not entertaining, especially John Cusack, as playwright ""David Shayne."" Cusack's character shouted, ranted and raved throughout his scenes. Yeah, I know he is supposed to deliberately overact, but that still doesn't make it fun to hear. His hysterics really begin to grate on you after awhile and especially if you watch this movie twice, which I did.

I liked the story and Palminteri, and could put up with Jennifer Tilley's deliberately-stupid bimbo character ""Olive Neal,"" but ""Shayne"" finally did me in. His character ruined the movie forever."

As a 14 year old playing the younger 12 year ""richest kid in the world"", Culkin and his management must have realized quickly that he could not stay a child actor forever. Richie Rich, therefore became Culkin's last major project until his return to film as a 23-year-old young adult in 2003's Party Monster.

In ""Rich"", no actor is in top form. The laughs were too few and too far between, especially for a family comedy. The post-Jurassic Park CGI ""robot bee"" may have even been a hindrance rather than a creative flourish. None of the characters were developed beyond the simple caricatures we'd expect and further stripped of comedic potential. By the time the antagonist breaks into the vault, anyone over the age of 17 probably knew what was inside; that is if they hadn't already stopped paying attention and fallen asleep.

Had the film starred another adolescent lead, we may have been forgiving, but the overall quality of this venture paled in comparison with the Culkin we knew from Uncle Buck, the Home Alone pictures, My Girl, and even his brief appearance in Michael Jackson's 9 minute ""Black or White"" rampage.

The very witty banter between Keaton's and Davis' characters is lively and thoroughly enjoyable. Their chemistry is wonderful and believable. The storyline is credible, too. It probably doesn't happen often inside opposite political camps but, just as Carville and Matlin are living examples that relationships can survive working for opposing party candidates, you'll savor watching the film's characters discover that love is the most important party.

At the beginning, there's a meeting where the guy says it's impossible to go forward in time because it hasn't happened yet - not true - hasn't he heard of Eintstein's theory of relativity? He then says you can go back in time 'because it's already happened' (which isn't an explanation of anything) - furthermore, backwards time travel is as doubtful now in 2008 as it was in 1994 when the film was made. Then he contradicts himself by claiming someone jumped forward in time to buy arms with gold bullion.

He says the age of the gold bullion was determined by carbon dating. Firstly if something jumped forward in time, then the process of carbon isotope decay would be skipped. Secondly, there isn't an awful lot of carbon in gold! I am willing to suspend belief when I watch science fiction, but it needs to come up with an explanation that is just a little bit plausible or keep it pure fantasy and miss out so-called scientific explanations.

Of all Van Damme movies this one of his, is the best of Van Damme ever and I absolutely love it to death. Like the title says Don't hunt what you can't kill. It is my John Woo's number 1 personal favorite action flick of all time, that I love to death. It is also one one of my personal favorite action films of all time.

""Don't hunt what you can't kill.""

The thrill of the hunt. It's the ultimate drug, and the more intense the rush, the higher the price. International superstar Jean-Claude Van Damme teams up with world-famous action director John Woo for this electrifying thriller Van Damme is the target of an evil mercenary (Lance Henriksen) who recruits homeless combat veterans for the ""amusement"" of his clients - bored tycoons who will pay a half a million dollars to stalk and kill the most challenging prey of them all: Man. Laced with dark humor and slam-packed with electrifying action Hard Target is a must see for action fans.

Hard Target is not only my John Woo favorite film, it is also my Jean-Claude Van Damme favorite best action film from my favorite action star. I put this film over Die Hard, this is my Die Hard movie. I love that the stunts were realistic I think that John Woo didn't allow Van Damme to make his own stunts and it is a shame that Jean-Claude Van Damme *beep* up his chance with John Woo by making on another film. It is Van Damme's ego fault. Still they don't make movies like this.

I heard that there is Driector's cut somewhere on DVD that I have never saw, I own this film on Blu-ray in my John Woo collection and I still love it. The stunts are crazy, the action are spectacular. Van Damme catching a snake wow incredible. (at one point, a movie's typical crazy stuntman; firing the Beretta 92FS 9mm while standing on the seat of a motorcycle and crashes in to the car.) Still the motorcycle chase sequence is my favorite scene in the film.

Van Damme ""launches thousands of bullets, slugs, and explosive projectiles into THIRTY of mercenary tycoons baddies."" Arnold Vosloo is also underrated actor who plays Pik van Cleef he did a really pretty good job as the villain and Fouchon second mercenary henchman. Possibly best role for him. ""I don't get angry. I'm a professional."" I love this movie the action is delivered perfectly. Honestly I love Arnold Vosloo more in this movie than Lance Henriksen and I love his character Pik van Cleef.

The trill of the hunt. It's the ultimate drug and the more intense the rush, the higher the price. Hard target was the film is saw as a teen when I was 18, I couldn't saw it as a kid I really don't know, it was never on TV and I have never seen a VHS cover in a video store. I didn't even know that movie exists.

Hard Target is a 1993 action film that marked the US directorial debut of acclaimed Hong Kong director John Woo, who brought out his Asian style of action to Western cinema.

I am surprised that the rating is not too high. The movie ""Deer hunter"" which was also about Vietname war, it was so slow and boring. If it didn't win some Oscars, I would have stopped watching in the middle of it. This movie is about the same feature length, but this one is much more emotional, and not boring at all.

It is another tear-jerking movie. This movie helped me to understand the pain that Vietnamese people suffered during the war. It is very authentic. Those are the common people who just want to make the best out of their lives, they just want to live. It was especially touching when she finally came back to her village, and her brother told her about how he felt throughout the years. She is not a hero, but she is such a brave woman who suffered so much, who almost died. How many of us will ever live a life like hers.

Lillian and Paul invite their neighbors to drink coffee with them in their apartment and Lillian shows her treadmill to Carol and Paul shows his collection of stamps to Larry. While drinking coffee, the elderly couple tells that they have been married for twenty-eight years and they have a twin tomb in the cemetery. Lillian tells that she is in good shape and uses her treadmill everyday.

On the next night, Carol and Larry go to see The Flying Dutchman in the theater and when they come back home, they learn that Lillian has died of heart attack. A couple of days later, Carol and Larry meet Paul on the street and Carol believes he is too perky for a widower that has just lost his beloved wife. When Carol accidentally finds an urn with Lillian's ashes in Paul's kitchen, she suspects that Paul has killed Lillian and comments with her friend Ted (Alan Alda). They decide to investigate her neighbor and Carol steals the keys of Paul's apartment from the super. She finds that Paul will travel to Paris and not to Caribbean as he had told to Larry and she, with a woman called Helen Moss. When Carol sees by chance Lillian alive in a bus, her curiosity increases and she decides to go further in her investigation.

Yesterday I was setting in order and cleaning my films on the shelf, and I decided to see again the VHS ""Manhattan Murder Mystery"". Last time I saw this film was in the 90's and I did not recall the story in details. Woody Allen is one of my favorite directors and actor, and that is the reason why I do not dare to say that this film is one of his best films because I love practically all his filmography.

""Manhattan Murder Mystery"" has mystery, suspense and the refined and witty humor typical from Woody Allen. One of my favorite moments is when Larry compares the need to Carol returning to her shrink with a GM's recall. Another very funny moment is when the clumsy Larry plays the wrong tape during the phone conversation with Paul. If the reader wants to spend 104 minutes laughing, watch ""Manhattan Murder Mystery"" since this film is funny even for those that are not fans of Woody Allen. My vote is eight.

Title (Brazil):""Um Misterioso Assassinato em Manhattan"" (""A Mysterious Murder in Manhattan"")

806,Menace II Society (1993),01-Jan-1993,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['Action', 'Crime', 'Drama']"," The feature debut of the Hughes brothers brings us the story of the life of young people in the Los Angeles ghetto. ""Menace II Society"" focuses on Caine (Tyrin Turner), the son of a drug dealer father and an addict mother, who grows up surrounded by scum and crime, but to which he does not belong in the soul and from which he tries to escape. Unfortunately, too late.

""Menace II Society"" is reminiscent of ""Goodfellas"" in its structure, and in essence a black version of ""American History X"". It's relentless and explicitly brutal, and while it's considered one of the most realistic portrayals of 1990s ghetto life, I think it's still rather over the top. Its main assets are the camera and directing, followed by the good acting of most of the characters. But the script is not its strong point.

For the first hour, the film is on the verge of boring, a mediocre crime drama about life in the ghetto, and only in the last third does it gain weight. But just when you are properly drawn into the story, the experience is spoiled by a couple of unnecessarily melodramatic scenes, without real emotional strength, and if you didn't predict the end at the beginning, it will be crystal clear to you now.

Also, the characters only function as part of the group and their environment, while individually they are two-dimensional and you will not get attached to them and sympathize with them. On top of that, the main character is probably the most uninteresting of them all, even irritating at times.

Although extremely negative, O-Dog is by far the most charismatic character in the film. The debut performance of the eighteen-year-old Tate is simply infectious, but it gives the film a note of propagating violence and crime, which the Hughes brothers did not intend. There's also a young Jada Pinkett, as well as a small but very impressive appearance by Samuel L. Jackson as Caine's father.

All in all, good cinematography and acting, and brutal realism are spoiled by the lack of a well-constructed story and characters that would arouse sincere emotions, and the dramatic ending loses its power because it is obvious from the very beginning.

807,Poetic Justice (1993),01-Jan-1993,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," I was hoping the main character, played by Janet Jackson, would lead to more adventures, like making a career out of her poetry composing, or befriend a nicer guy than Lucky (Tupac). After her boyfriend is killed at the beginning, Justice dives into despair and writes poems to escape her depression. She is dragged along for an anonymous ride with her friend and her boyfriend plus Lucky, which ends up in nothing but arguments and domestic violence.

Why is Justice hanging out with these people? She could have made it big with her poetry and gotten out of South Central, get her dreams started and move on from her harsh life. Instead nothing really happens except that she and Lucky seem to share the same views on violent social life, which turns out to be boring.

John Singleton seems to put in more bitchy, annoying domestic and social arguments between his characters in this film, Higher Learning, Baby Boy and this film unfortunately lack the deepness of his outstanding directional techniques he used for his first feature film, Boyz In Da Hood. 2fast 2furious and Four Brothers are taken out of the ghetto, but they don't share the rawness and desperation of Boyz. Shaft, on the other hand, is a change to the director's inventory and also shines a few ""behind the camera"" genius sparks he first showed us in his Oscar-nominated film Boyz In Da Hood."

810,"Shadow, The (1994)",01-Jan-1994,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Action']," In 1930s New York City, the Shadow (Alec Baldwin) battles his nemesis, Shiwan Khan (John Lone), who is building an atomic bomb out of unstable bronzium and beryllium spheres.

This film gets a bum wrap. While the picture is a great film, it is a decent adaptation of the old radio dramas and serial films (such as ""Behind the Mask""). While audiences of the 1990s may not have been familiar, many of the story elements were taken directly from the radio dramas and pulp novels. Even before Batman, there was the Shadow (with even an inside man on the New York Police Department).

As mentioned, the scenarios in this film come from the old novels and writer David Koepp created more than decent adaptations and his work was done with good intent and absolute reverence. Koepp, a Wisconsin native, is no slouch -- he is the fifth most successful screenwriter of all time in terms of domestic box office receipts, with such films as ""Jurassic Park"", ""Mission Impossible"", and ""Spider-Man"".

Alec Baldwin is surprisingly good in the role of Lamont Cranston -- who could have pictured him a hero? Not long before, he was a scrawny nerd in ""Beetlejuice"". The impressive cast could be singled out one by one -- Jonathan Winters, Tim Curry, Penelope Ann Miller and more... this was quite the ensemble.

Some things did not make a lot of sense, but I think perhaps that was intentional. Or, as Ebert says, ""If the movie is finally just a little less than the sum of its parts, maybe that's appropriate."" Unfortunately, the least coherent part is the beginning (which includes the origin story), and this might lose some viewers before they have decided to even give the movie a chance. And then the rest of the film sort of glosses over the moral conundrum that this millionaire playboy can afford to be a hero because he made his money addicting Tibetans to heroin and opium...

Thanks to Shout Factory, we now have a slick new Blu-Ray disc looking better than ever. Sadly, the features are a bit weak for a special edition. Although they were able to track down the writer, director, cinematographer and two of the three lead actors to create a 23-minute featurette (worth watching), apparently none of these folks was willing to provide a couple hours for commentary.

This is the sort of film that was overlooked in its day (losing revenue to ""The Mask"") and really deserves a sequel, though of course at this point the only option is a remake. If the rumors of Sam Raimi wanting to tackle the project turn out to be true, maybe some day we will see it..."

I like this film because I'm an animal lover and this film is filled with animals.

""Andre"" is about a little girl, Toni Whitney, played by Tina Majorina, who lives with her parents Harry and Thalice, played by Shane Meier and Chelsea Field; her sister, Paula, played by Aidan Pendleton; and her brother Steve, played by Keith Carradine. They have an assortment of animals, and decide to adopt an orphaned, baby seal that that they name Andre. Andre lives with the Whitney's for a few years, until a man from the health department shows up and wants to take Andre away!

My favorite character in this film is Toni's mother, Thalice. I like Thalice because she is very loving toward her kids, yet also knows how to discipline them.

My favorite scene in this movie is when Andre learns funny tricks and performs them for people on the pier. I like this scene because Andre is so cute and fun. An interesting fact is that Andre is played by a sea lion, not a seal, in the movie.

""Andre"" is directed by George Miller and produced by Annette Handley. The music in this film sets the mood. The movie is filmed in a beautiful harbor in Rockport, Maine and I especially love the cinematography when the seasons change.

This movie is a tear-jerker and Toni learns that despite how much she loves Andre she may have to let him go. This is a family-friendly movie and I recommend it to people of all ages. I give this film five-out-of- five stars because I thought that the movie was really well-done overall and had a great plot. I am pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed this movie so much because the picture on the cover made me think that it would appeal to a younger audience."

Yes, some of the people interviewed are more informative than others - Gore Vidal's stories about the creation of *Ben Hur* are perhaps at the top, but others have interesting things to say as well. The range of movies from which the clips were taken is very impressive indeed, and is a tribute to Vito Russo's historical work on the topic, on which this movie was based.

My only objection is that no one and no movie is identified. Yes, they are all listed in the credits at the end. But I really would like to have learned, as I watched it, what movies some of those clips came from, and who some of the interviewees I did not recognize were. Perhaps on the dvd version that omission is rectified?

That notwithstanding, I recommend this movie without reservation for anyone who wants to see how gays and lesbians were portrayed in the first hundred years of American cinema. Yes, I'm sure there is some favorite movie of yours, or movie scene, that is left out. That's inevitable. You can't cover all the movies Russo mentions in one film. Yes, it's unfortunate that there is no sequel to cover Hollywood since 1988, or foreign movies, or tv shows. But those are not faults with what is here, which is very entertaining and informative.

A very well made movie."

It has scenes as quick witted - and often as wackily off-kilter! - as the adults must be just in order to survive their average day. Stir love into this mess of two increasingly desparate modern lives and you get a miraculous souffle of a film, at once sharp and sweet.

No scene is laboured, no point is telegraphed, and - phenomenally for a modern American film - neither kids nor kittens are allowed to smother the audience in the nauseous layers of cutesiness that are usually applied. The scene with the analyst, where Clooney must obscure his account of his sex-life in an ever-more-surrealistic periphrasis involving iced cakes and fish, since his little daughter has to accompany him into the presumably crecheless analyst's surgery, and her dad is embarassed to expose her to such adult matters as he is obliged to reveal during the session, is a scene which is a model of intelligent and stylish comedy writing. The dialogue of both himself and his analyst finally founders on the increasingly strained comparisons and metaphors being attempted. The analyst begins to construct an alarmingly kinky lifestyle for his client out of what he takes to be Freudian suggestions - but which are, as noted, merely the product of old-fashioned seemliness - whereupon Clooney is forced to bring the whole towering edifice back down to earth when his version of the morning's business with the goldfish gets mixed up in the heady brew of symbolism: 'No. I mean fish. You know - 'Fish' fish?'

The humour is all good, never strained, and beautifully played by all the principals, including the wonderfully un-sentimentalised children. The transformation, stage-by-stage, of the harsh mutual competition and resentment that exists at first between these harassed adults, into an exhausted truce, by way of barely-restrained irritation, grudging gratitude, reluctant respect, and growing affection, is handled with considerable dramatic finesse throughout.

To produce the unlikely union of such an ill-assorted pair under such utterly unpropitious and unromantic circumstances is a comedic challenge of considerable proportions, and the makers of this film do an excellent job to bring it off at all. The spirits of Grant and Hepburn - even Beatrice and Benedict - are not too far away.

The only disappointment is to see how many people in the audience have gone home just as sour as when they arrived, judging from some of the comments here. But then, love curdles in any mean-spirited breast.

One particularly admires the fact that, at its conclusion, the film's romantic clincher - when the tired-out couple have to settle for just falling asleep together, despite their by now clearly desparate need for each other, - insists upon the importance of exactly this: Love, rather than merely lust, as the basis for an adult relationship.

Just occasionally, Hollywood still lets us have a grown-up entertainment. It makes a pleasant and wholesome change from the usual fare of adolescent dreams."

Watching Spike Lee movies all these years I know what to expect going into a Spike Lee movie. Incredible dialog, incredible acting, messages or even incredible film scores (courtesy of Terence Blanchard). Spike Lee's 1996 effort Girl 6 however is a tough cookie. Upon seeing it for the first time, I was confused. There were a lot of elements in this film that I hadn't seen in any of Spike's films before. The cameos and the attempt to make this a straight forward comedy was some of the things I had never seen Spike do. But I had confidence in him and knew that he'd make this film watchable. Over the years I had been on the fence about this film and couldn't really figured out what I liked about this film. Was it the fact that it was a Spike Lee joint? Was it the incredible Prince soundtrack? So I decided to sit down and analyze the DVD of the film. We meet an actress (Theresa Randle) in the middle of an audition being conducted by Quentin Tarantino. We witness her walking out on the part because of demands and we also see her being dropped by her agent and kicked out of her acting class. Down on her luck, she looks in the classifieds and find phone sex companies looking for new ladies. She takes the job and we see Girl 6 blossom before our eyes. She has her highs and lows in the business but remains an aspiring actress at heart. Complete with fantasy scenes, Prince music, cameos and Spikes trademark shots Girl 6 was an OK comedy at best. Scenes made me cringe (see the Jeffersons/Good Times fantasy sequence), some made me laugh and the ending left me disappointed. I had now come to see what everyone disliked about the movie. But it wasn't as bad as everyone made it seem. Sure its a Spike Lee joint but don't expect it to be on the level of Do The Right Thing, Malcolm X or Bamboozled. Spike lapsed on this one but it still has its moments. 8 years after Girl 6, Spike would suffer the same fate in 2004's She Hate Me. Maybe comedy isn't his thing but Girl 6 (also see his child friendly 1994 film Crooklyn) separated him from the angry and controversial persona that the press made him out to be. Girl 6 is a mixed bag but it is watchable. I honestly can't say that I wouldn't sit down and watch the whole thing again.

820,Space Jam (1996),15-Nov-1996,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['Adventure', 'Animation', ""Children's"", 'Comedy', 'Fantasy']"," NOTE: This film was recommended to me by Ryan Clevenger for ""Steve Pulaski Sees It.""

Living in Illinois, Space Jam is a film that hits the tender spots of the last two generations; one generation that got to experience Michael Jordan's unfathomable legacy as arguably the greatest basketball player who ever lived, and the other, mine, that reflects on his legacy through highlights and documentaries to keep the memory of such an all-star alive. Jordan's legacy didn't stop at on-court talent, as he was one of the most marketed athletes of his time and helped popularize the NBA, let alone the Chicago Bulls, on a previously unforeseen international level.

If we remove the nostalgia factor from Space Jam, which is a very difficult thing to do by the way, then the film serves as Jordan's versatility. After retiring from the NBA at a relatively young age to pursue a career in baseball, Jordan only became more of a fascinating person, in addition to someone with impeccable charisma. Space Jam exists as a response to Jordan's departure from the NBA to the MLB, as the Looney Tune gang of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Tweety Bird, Sylvester the Cat, Porky Pig, and Lola Bunny all call Jordan out of retirement when they challenge a group of intergalactic invaders from ""Moron Mountain"" to a basketball game in exchange for the planet.

The Looney Tunes thing this will be an easy win, until the aliens from Moron Mountain, who are relatively puny in size and strength, find a way to steal the talents of star basketball players like Charles Barkley and Larry Johnson and become the ""Monstars"" of the court. Meanwhile, Jordan agrees to play for the Looney Tunes team, but it takes all of the five minutes of practice to show that the team is disproportionately talented towards Jordan. As a result, the team indulges in some aggressive training tactics to beat the Monstars and save the planet.

As an amalgamation of live-action and animation, especially in an age where Pixar was coming on the scene and traditional animation was soon to be phased out, Space Jam is bright and vivid. The real-life characters of Michael Jordan, Wayne Knight, who has an amusing role, like he always does, Larry Bird, and even Bill Murray's interactions with the animated characters of Bugs Bunny and the like in a convincing, believable manner. The result is a beautifully colored and nicely executed mix of whimsy.

Because both worlds of reality and animation are explored here, Space Jam has the luxury of being a film that can go beyond traditional boundaries of a sports film, and the Looney Tunes are no better characters to incite such zaniness. The animated bunch are quick-witted and ecstatic, and Jordan is clearly doing this for fun and excitement rather than a phoned-in project or another endorsement. Had Space Jam been more of a lackluster cash-in, sports fans and Jordan fans would've seen it from a mile away and dismissed the film immediately. However, because everyone involved recognizes what a zany project this is, they don't try to fight the lunacy, but instead, play along, and that provides us, the audience, with a wickedly entertaining stride into a lively sports film that is so fun you almost, almost miss the clich√©d underdog element.

I imagined it as a romantic comedy of sorts, and yet from the very beginning it was really quite heavy, dealing as it did with young Connie (Rikki Lake) being homeless, then meeting up with a sleazebag and then being tossed out by him when he gets her pregnant. I really wasn't feeling much fun at that point in the movie. Then mistaken identity turns into deliberate deceit on Connie's part (although I understand it wasn't malicious.) Once she gets taken in by the Winterbourne's after the train wreck that kills their son and his wife (whom the family has never met, and whom Connie is mistaken for) the only character who really made sense to me was Bill (Brendan Fraser), who seemed appropriately suspicious of her given the circumstances. True, he was ridiculously obnoxious, but his suspicion was bang on, except that he then, for no obvious reason that I saw, fell head over heels in love with her, letting go of all his suspicions and deciding to marry her! Where did that come from?

There are some moments of fun in this. Shirley MacLaine (as the matriarch of the Winterbourne clan) was probably the best part of the movie and provided much of the comedy, and the closing scenes (as everyone tries to protect Connie/Patricia) was quite touching, as was the point that the Winterbournes became the family she never had. There was a nice feel to that, especially because we know that Connie isn't out for the family's money, but just wants the sense of family for herself and even more for her son.

There was one huge inconsistency here that just made everything else implausible, though. Bill finally figures out what's going on because he sees ""Patricia"" sign ""Connie Doyle"" on a check, and investigates who Connie Doyle is. He gets back a report that Connie and her unborn baby were killed in the train wreck (it was, of course, the real Patricia and her unborn baby who were killed.) How would he get that report? Connie wasn't supposed to be on that train. She got swept into it by a huge crowd of people, she had no ticket, and since it wasn't really Connie there would be no way of identifying the body as Connie. How then would anyone come to the conclusion that the dead body was Connie when no one knew Connie was on that train - and, in fact, no one on that train even knew Connie?

This isn't an unenjoyable movie. It's quite touching, really - but it does have a lot of flaws! 5/10"

I'm sorry, but noir never really works for me unless it's steeped in shadows and a colorless world. That's just what I've been conditioned to expect from a good noir movie. If Mulholland Falls would have been set in the modern day, I think that the color wouldn't have bothered me as much, but the combination of the time period and the style makes the colorization just to much for me to tolerate.

As for Jennifer, she's the crux of the film, but we don't get to spend very much time at all with her. We don't get a sense of who she is and why she did the things that she did, and that greatly lessens the impact of her death. If you don't care about the core of the story, then it's difficult to have any real investment in the rest of the movie.

In all honesty, even if the movie was in black and white and Jennifer Connelly had two times more scenes, this movie would probably still be boring. I just never cared or was interested in what was going on. Michael Madsen was wasted, there wasn't nearly enough of John Malkovich, and Nick Nolte was just smacking people and looking grim. Mulholland Falls gets two stars for Jennifer Connelly's magnificence, but even her wonders barely made it worth watching."

Writer/director David Twohy accomplished the near-impossible in the summer of 1996; he delivered a fun, fast-paced AND intelligent sci-fi thriller with The Arrival, an intriguing, thought-provoking film that was unfairly ignored in theaters at the time of its release (most viewers chose to see Twister, M:I, Independence Day). The movie has a classic premise about a radio astronomer (Charlie Sheen) who receives a signal from outer space that may or may not have come from extraterrestrial life.

To say anymore would be unforgivable, as Twohy packs in believable twists and turns throughout the plot, which is fun without insulting the brain, and complex without ever bogging down in mind-numbing confusion. The script does have a few head-scratchers here and there (I was particularly miffed that Lindsay Crouse's character, an environmentalist, wasn't familiar with the concept of terraforming) and some contrivances, but they're hardly bothersome and aren't noticeable until a second viewing.

As good a screenwriter as Twohy is, he's even more adept as a director (further proven by Pitch Black, a superbly crafted deep-space thriller with a script not even half as smart as The Arrival's). With great pacing and precise editing, Twohy builds momentum with each discovery Sheen unfolds, until it culminates to an edge-of-the-seat climax that's quite satisfying (unlike...cough...cough...""V: the Final Battle"", Independence Day).

The cast is all-around effective, with Sheen delivering a surprisingly terrific performance as the paranoid astronomer. It's great to see an intelligent protagonist who thinks his way out of tight jams, rather than shooting and blowing up everything in sight. No one else gets half of Sheen's screentime, but Ron Silver is nicely ambiguous as his boss, and Teri Polo, however underused, is fine as Sheen's girlfriend. Lindsay Crouse also makes a good impression as an environmentalist studying some strange activity.

On a technical level, some sci-fi fans might be a little disappointed. Those weaned on ""V"" and ID4 will notice the lack of large-scale special effects. Sorry, no disc-shaped motherships here. Still, the visuals present are mostly decent, certainly passable enough that they don't become a distraction to the plot. Despite the use of CGI in its more primitive stages (this was '96, after all) the effects are still occasionally excellent and imaginative, such as the spherical object those tight-lipped men wield. Composer Arthur Kempel's score adds a bit more tension to the already excruciating suspense, and evokes a creepy atmosphere during the film's quieter moments.

Remember, folks, The Arrival is a rarity, a once in a while example of how pure movie magic can be created when we've got dedicated filmmakers who want to intrigue the audience rather than catering to demographics just for the sake of box office returns. Forget Independence Day, The War of the Worlds, or V and its sequel, The Arrival is the most satisfying cinematic depiction of alien invasion to date."
826,"Phantom, The (1996)",07-Jun-1996,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Adventure']," The Phantom originated with a comic strip in 1936. He is a superhero without super powers, surrounded by myths and mysticism. This film preserves the comic strip feel of the original hero, much like the TV series of Batman that featured Adam West. Billy Zane, who portrays The Phamtom, even sounds like Adam West when he talks.

Many of the characters feel like they come from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". The action borders on silliness, as if punches should be accompanied by bubbles saying ""POW!"" or ""BAM!"" a la ""Batman"".

The Phantom is called ""the ghost who walks"", but much of the time he rides his horse called Hero, accompanied by his wolf named Devil. Most of the characters are clich√©d caricatures.

The action takes place just before WWII and the non-jungle scenes capture that era effectively. The scenery and the design aspects of the film, including the fashions, are the best part of the film.

Kristy Swanson plays the part of Diana Palmer, love interest to the main character. There is no chemistry between them. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Sala, the bad girl accomplice of the villains-a small part that allows her to shine briefly. Treat Williams plays Xander Drax, the villain, with true comic-strip smarminess and relish.

Had they modernized The Phantom as was done with later Batman films, it might have been more successful. The ""Agent Carter"" TV series is an example of doing it right. This film lacked the humor that might have sold its tongue-in-cheek approach."

However this film also delivers on the emotional level and follows a journey of transformation as beautiful as the visual aspects.

A single father apts for a change after losing his wife by moving to Alaska with his two children to become a bush pilot. His son is resentful at best, ungrateful, and unappreciative of the vast and stunning riches Alaska has to offer. When their father's plane goes down and rescue efforts fail, they begin a spiritual journey that will forever change their lives. The son, Shawn, played by Vincent Karthieser, soon comes to terms with the death of his mother, the love for his father, and the respect and appreciation for Alaska. Thora Birch, an actress with a promising future, provides the level-headed and sensible approach to the journey in contrast to her brother's cockiness and arrogance which provides for great chemistry between the two.

Along with the natural beauty and landscapes just about every other aspect associated with Alaska is present from: poaching, bushpilots, kayaking, rustic cabins, rock climbing,, moutaineering, camping, and the northern lights along with Cubby, a baby polar bear who tags along and even provides for some tear jerking moments and light hearted humor.

Overall this is a great movie for the entire family or for one with a fascination with the wonders and beauty of the last frontier. It truly evokes a sense of appreciation delivered in a manner without the concept of strong language, violence, and nudity, the three marketing schemes of the industry. It is a fantastic adventure, with great camera angles, stunning visuals and a powerful message. Very well done IMHO."

This thrilling picture results to be an inferior sequel to Escape from N.Y. , the latter become a real Cult Movie . It contains mystery , chills , noisy action , thrills , fights , social critical , bits of humor with tongue-in cheek attitude and a weird atmosphere with dark and surprising ending . Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell, he was the only cast member from the original film to appear in the sequel)is once again called in by the United States government (Stacy Keach as officer , Michele Forbes as deputy and Clift Robertson as President) to recover a potential doomsday device from Los Angeles, now an autonomous island where undesirables are deported and finds itself under siege by violent gangs . A previous war hero named Snake Plissken gone rebel must execute a daring adventure and bring up a powerful artifact in twenty four hours . Snake must recover it and along the way facing off villains like Cuervo Jones (George Corraface) . He's only helped by a sympathetic rogue underling (Steve Buscemi who took the part in this film to help fund his directorial debut, Trees Lounge) , and action women (Valeria Golino, Pam Grier) . As Snake Plissken to get in and out of Los Angeles .

The film is a comic book plenty of action , fun , adventures , suspense , thriller and surprise-filled entertainment . Magnificent plethora of characters with decent performances by its entire cast . Middle-budget by Paramount Pictures , in fact its President Sherry Lansing was a fan of ""Escape from New York"" and wanted John Carpenter, Kurt Russell and Debra Hill to make the sequel in the same vein as the original. Kurt Russell as tough and valiant renegade is terrific . At the beginning of the film, Kurt Russell wears his costume from the original film, which still fits after 15 years . Kurt Russell not only came up with but wrote the entire ending of the movie , in fact it was the first and only writing credit . Escape From LA was caught in development hell for over ten years . A script for the film was first commissioned in 1985 but John Carpenter thought it ""too light, too campy"" . An initial script was written , but it remained dormant until Carpenter and Kurt Russell got together with frequent collaborator Debra Hill. It was Russell's persistence that got the film made ; Snake Plissken was his favourite character, a character he loved and wanted to play again . Support cast is frankly good such as Peter Fonda , Cliff Robertson , Valeria Golino , Stacy Keach , Pam Grier , Bruce Campbell , Michelle Forbes , A.J. Langer and Peter Jason , Carpenter's usual . The picture contains an imaginative and memorable production design by Lawrence G. Paull . Colorful and glimmer cinematography by Gary B. Kibbe . John Carpenter also made the atmospheric music score along with Shirley Walker . The movie likely to satisfy action enthusiasts and Kurt Russell fans .

Director John Carpenter is in familiar ground with this well-done tale on the style of comic books and old Sci-Fi serials . His films often feature important visuals shown from a video screen , as the end-of-the-world transmission from the future in ¬®Prince of darkness¬® (1987), the Norwegian recordings of the expedition to uncover the aliens in ¬®The Thing¬® (1982), various TV sets and the general anti-TV motif in ¬®They live¬®(1988), etc. ¬®1997 escape from N.Y¬® was realized during his best period in the 70s and late 8os when he directed classics as ¬®Halloween¬®, ¬®The fog ¬®, ¬®Christine¬®, ¬®They live¬® , ¬®Big Trouble in Little China¬® and ¬®The thing¬® . The sequel ¬®Escape from L.A¬® rating : average but entertaining . The movie will enjoy to noisy action fans but packs a roller-coaster thriller and wholesome amusement . The film will appeal to John Carpenter enthusiasts . A third sequel was going to be made titled Escape from Earth which would have had Snake escaping Earth after a dark matter experiment. However, the negative reaction to this film prevented the sequel from being developed. As the movie was a notorious failure on release, making around $25 million , just half its budget , at the US box office. Many reviews criticized the film for being too violent or for being too similar to the original film ."

The movie is about a little boy, named Albert who loses his mother in a car wreck. He has to go and live with his mothers foster sister (played by Whoopi) who knows absolutely nothing about children. So the kid gets an imaginary friend.

The film is sad in places... i felt sorry for Albert. Haley Joel Osment played Albert... his work was not very convincing in parts of the movie. But then it is so hard to find a good child actor. I think I can name only 2 really great child actors. (Maisie Williams & Dakota Fanning)

Whoopi Goldberg is a brilliant actress and she does another great job in this. I think she is one of the best actresses in America. I loved her in the Sister Act movies, Ghost, Made in America and Burglar... but my favourite film of hers is Jumpin' Jack Flash. Her character is a career driven person who does not have the time for kids. Whoopi was convincing and I felt sorry for her through the movie because she really was thrown in the deep end really by having this boy dumped in her lap.

Gerard Depardieu plays the imaginary friend named Bogus. He also did a good job. He was funny in places and really believable that he cares.

I don't really have anything bad to say about this movie, except maybe Haley wasn't very good at certain points.

The story was good. It made me smile and made me feel sad in places.

A good movie... I will give this 7 out of 10. I hope to see Whoopi back in a blockbuster where she belongs very soon.

834,Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers (1995),01-Jan-1995,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"['Horror', 'Thriller']"," John Carpenter's 1978 'Halloween' is wholly deserving of its status as a horror classic. To this day it's still one of the freakiest films personally seen and introduced the world to one of horror's most iconic villainous characters Michael Myers.

Which is why it is such a shame that not only are all of the sequels nowhere near as good but that the decline in quality is so drastic. Ok, the original 'Halloween' is very difficult to follow on from, but most of the sequels could at least looked like effort was made into them. 'Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers' is a prime example of this, a film with very little to recommend and just very poorly done in many areas.

Starting with the very few good things, Paul Rudd and Donald Pleasance, in his last film before his death from heart failure not long after (although his screen time is far too short and was clearly severely truncated), come off in a good way in the acting department.

The exploding head death is a pretty fun one and the setting is eerie. As far as praises go, that is it.

'Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers' was directed by someone who had an apparent dislike for Pleasance, the main reason for his limited screen time most likely, and had no interest in directing the film or the 'Halloween' series in general, and it shows loud and clear on screen. Even the direction in 'Season of the Witch' and 'Halloween 5' wasn't this indifferent or inept.

Sadly the effectiveness of the setting, which actually is eerie, is hindered by the filming and editing being pretty amateurish, the photography often is far too dark and drab and the editing makes bacon-slicer-like editing seem coherent in comparison. The music, like the previous film, is here a drawback when it was one of the better elements of the first four films. Here it sounds cheap, goofy and would have sounded out of date even in the 80s most likely.

Everything looks, sounds and feels like it was made in a rush and with absolutely no heart, accounting for the constant sense of incompleteness. There is nothing scary or suspenseful, it's unintentionally campy, uncomfortably strange and by the numbers with a convoluted story that makes no sense whatsoever, an abrupt ending, dull pacing and the man in black/cult plot that is just bizarre and just muddles everything. Michael Myers is just not creepy enough and looks goofy.

Very like the previous sequel, there is nothing interesting or endearing about the characters (though none are quite as annoying as Tina in 'Halloween 5'). The script especially sounds incomplete and the acting, apart from Rudd and Pleasance (whose screen time, as said, is far too short), is subpar to put it lightly. J.C. Brandy is a pretty poor replacement for Danielle Harris.

Overall, don't expect any terror, scares, fear or thrills here, you'll be disappointed. 3/10 Bethany Cox"
835,"Gay Divorcee, The (1934)",01-Jan-1934,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,"['Comedy', 'Musical', 'Romance']"," The Gay Divorc√©e is the answer to the trivia question of which of Fred Astaire's and Ginger Rogers's is one that Fred Astaire had previously done on Broadway. When Astaire did it on Broadway, the Cole Porter musical had been entitled The Gay Divorce. But that extra 'e' was added on lest anyone get the idea that divorce itself was something frivolous. Imagine anticipating Britney Spears by about 70 years.

Actually Fred had also done Funny Face and The Bandwagon on stage as well. But on stage The Bandwagon was a revue and Funny Face had an entirely different plot than the musical made by Astaire in the Fifties. Only in The Gay Divorc√©e was he asked to repeat a stage role.

The basic plot is still the same, the usual Astaire-Rogers case of mistaken identity. Ginger is the budding divorc√©e going to London to get a divorce as Aunt Alice Brady hired a professional co-respondent. Ginger mistakes Fred for that co-respondent and it takes a while for Fred to warm her up.

Fred's an American musical comedy star visiting London with his manager Edward Everett Horton who also happens to know Brady. This gives the excuse for the musical numbers.

Cole Porter's score was cut completely from the screen other than the immortal Night and Day. In it's place came four songs, three written by Harry Revel&Mack Gordon and one written by Con Conrad&Herb Magdison. Fred and Ginger dance divinely to Night and Day.

Fred does a solo dance to A Needle in a Haystack and Don't Let It Bother You. Betty Grable got her first notice from the movie going public, singing and dancing in Let's Knock Knees all of which were contributed by Revel&Gordon.

But it was The Continental number by Con Conrad and Herbert Magdison that got the first Academy Award ever given out for Best Original Song in a motion picture. It's what The Gay Divorc√©e is remembered for today. It's a rather long, between ten and fifteen minutes of screen time, but as magical as ever

The Gay Divorce ran for 248 performances on Broadway during the 1932- 1933 season. Sacrificed for romance are Porter's witty lyrics in the rest of the score containing their usual commentary on the social scene. Of all the American musical giants of the era, I would say that Cole Porter wins hands down as the man that Hollywood butchered the most in bringing his work to the screen. Even before The Code was in place, it seemed that the powers that be deemed that his work was way too sophisticated and naughty to be seen and heard as is.

Still with the film being frothy romance instead of social commentary, The Gay Divorc√©e is still great entertainment. Also repeating their roles from Broadway are supercilious waiter Eric Blore and the real co-respondent Tonetti who prefers spaghetti, Erik Rhodes.

Wit for romance, you decide if it was a fair exchange."
836,Ninotchka (1939),01-Jan-1939,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"['Comedy', 'Romance']"," ""Garbo Laughs!"" was the tagline splattered on posters of Ninotchka, regardless of whether or not she'd actually laughed in other movies. She had, but if you want to see her guffaw and pound the table, you'll have to rent this one. It's a classic silver screen comedy, and one of the few old movies that are still known to modern audiences. It's tailor-made for the Swedish star, who famously rattles off, ""Don't make an issue of my womanhood,"" during her entrance. Greta Garbo was such a mannish star, yet in her earlier films, she was always cast as a sex symbol. Ninotchka is a perfect and hilarious change of pace for her; she's a Russian Communist without frills or romance on her mind, and her natural masculinity can finally be showcased. This was the first of her movies I saw, so I always thought she was a homely actress. When I finally saw her in Camille, I was shocked that she looked so pretty! Melvyn Douglas plays a Parisian playboy who likes all the things Greta doesn't. He tries flirting with her as she asks directions to the Eiffel Tower, and after a few rebuffs, she asks, ""Must you flirt?"" ""Well, I don't have to, but I find it comes naturally,"" Mel smirks. The perfect tamper on his impeccable timing, Greta shuts him up with the order, ""Suppress it."" While his role could have been ably played by any number of Hollywood's leading men, Robert Montgomery, Robert Young, Fred Astaire, Cary Grant, it's Melvyn Douglas who's immortalized as Greta's counterpoint, and it's part of the reason he's so well-remembered from his leading man days in the silver screen.

Technically, the film is categorized as an adapted screenplay. However, the source upon which it was based was a three-sentence idea from the MGM studio: ""Russian girl saturated with Bolshevist ideals goes to fearful, capitalistic, monopolistic Paris. She meets romance and has an uproarious good time. Capitalism not so bad, after all."" That's it, folks; that's what the screenwriters had to work with. Thankfully, that's not at all how the movie comes across; it's not a political commentary. This is a romance between an innocent girl who's never been treated to the high life and a playboy who learns to see life through her eyes.

In a movie showcasing Greta Garbo, with the endless comic talents of Melvyn Douglas, with a hilarious screenplay, it's amazing that the person who runs away with the movie has nearly the smallest part. Felix Bressart, a German actor who fled to the United States during the Nazi rise to power, made his American splash in Ninotchka and made several movies per year for the next ten years. His unique look, his sweet, soft voice, and the sincerity of his emotions wins the audience over in any given scene. In one scene, Melvyn is getting the three silly sidekicks-Felix Bressart, Sig Ruman, and Alexander Granach were ironically all German actors playing Russians-drunk while trying to trick information out of them. ""Why are you so good to us?"" Felix coos, embracing Mel. ""Yes, why are you so good to us?"" the others chime in, covering Mel with kisses. It's such an adorable moment in an adorable movie, one that will instantly make you a fan of the new German star.

There are so many great scenes, sweet moments, and hilarious one-liners that will have you popping in Ninotchka time after time. My VHS copy from high school is nearly worn through, I've watched it so many times. When Greta Garbo tastes champagne for the first time, such an adorable expression passes across her face. She insists she should be punished for being so happy, so Mel pretends to execute her in the firing squad via a champagne bottle. The silly hat, the goat milk, and the cigarette girls all leave you smiling and wanting more. Why is the movie so good to us? Lots of reasons, so if you haven't found out yet, watch it tonight!"
837,Meet John Doe (1941),01-Jan-1941,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," ""Meet John Doe"" has in it some good performances. Walter Brennan played Gary Cooper's cynical hobo friend almost to perfection, at least as well as the role could be played given the flawed script. He saw the conventional world as one full of ""heelots"" (lots of heels) who were only after the other guy's money. Cooper, as John Doe, handed in a credible performance, as well, and Barbara Stanwick, when she wasn't overacting, was generally interesting to watch and easy on the eyes. The actors portraying the newspaper editor and the media magnate were also effective. But this story and this script, while reaching for greater meaning, had the unfortunate tendency to fall back on schmaltzy clich√©s and flag-waving propaganda and that kept the movie from realizing its full promise and potential. Director Capra, whose talents were greatly admired in the movie industry, didn't seem able to make up his mind if he wanted this thing to be a somewhat saccharine, albeit uplifting Christmas movie about people forgetting their petty differences and coming together, or something quite different, that being a cynical and gritty political statement about the rich and powerful's compelling need to use and abuse the common man. The movie tried to combine elements of both themes yet it only partly succeeded on either score. In contrast, ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" which attempted much the same thing, succeeded where ""Meet John Doe"" missed the mark. It was a far more effective Christmas movie, yet at the same time contained significant elements that examined dishonesty, cruelty, and greed. Still, ""Meet John Doe,"" a less admired, less focused, and less consistent effort featured some compelling scenes. I thought the argument between Doe and DB Norton, the fascist media magnate who was hoping to launch a presidential bid on the strength of the John Doe Clubs, was probably the best scene in the film, although Walter Brennan's speech about the ""heelots"" was also quite good. The mob scene, reminiscent of Christ's crucifixion, no doubt was intended to be the film's most powerful sequence, and on balance it was fairly gripping. Unfortunately, it contained obvious continuity errors that detracted seriously from its believability. For example, Norton's troopers grabbed Doe to stop him from speaking to the crowd and exposing Norton's evil scheme, then all of a sudden, they released him and stood back, allowing him to weakly defend himself in front of the mike. Whereas the mob seemed to sympathize with him even when disillusioned by the disturbing allegations leveled against him, suddenly they were out for his blood. It didn't really add up, at least not as it unfolded. The last scene in the movie, where Doe climbed City Hall intending to commit suicide, aspired to be a very moving moment but was even more flawed. The magnate and his fellow conspirators were on hand and they didn't want him to go through with it because it might spoil their attempts to salvage what was left of their meglomaniacal aims, but evidently they felt somewhat guilty for their part in his destruction. Doe simply brushed them aside, and in what was perhaps Coop's most convincing moment, he was just about to leap to his death when Barbara Stanwick dashed forward to stop him. Unfortunately, that's when the movie took a real nosedive. Her lines were painfully contrived and delivered in a thoroughly unconvincing manner. As such, the ending was like the rest of the flick, inching up on something quite good and then falling flat. Too bad; with more polishing, significant editing and re-shooting, it could have been a much better movie."

As a matter of fact, it's the various endearing characters which make it watchable - and not just the titular duo (the surprising, but most capable, cast of voice actors includes such veterans as Jack Albertson, Pearl Bailey, John Fiedler, John McIntire, Jeanette Nolan, and Mickey Rooney as Tod the Fox); that said, the romantic interest which crops up during its last third proves a distraction from the central relationship - which is quite movingly developed.

950,Georgia (1995),01-Jan-1995,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," Jennifer Jason Leigh here pulls off another of her 'impossible' performances. Is there any film actress as versatile as she is? Is there anything she can't do or any role she cannot play? When she acts, she throws herself into the role with the force of an express train. Here she transforms into a hopeless, cheery, ever-smiling flop of a girl, who has failed at everything but just goes on in good humour, taking it on the chin from Life time after time. Her pathetic, sprawling, inept character is endlessly endearing, like a delightful child, even though she drives everyone she knows crazy because she is so hopeless. She can't stay off the drugs, or the booze, or out of bed with anyone for a quickie. She doesn't know when to start, she doesn't know when to stop. She is behaviour-dyslexic. Her thoroughly controlled and successful older sister gets her revenge on little sister by extending icy and permanent tolerance, disguising condescension as devotion. The two sisters are both singers, and the older one, Georgia of the title (though the star is really Sadie, the Leigh character), is a magnificent folk singer with a marvellously controlled and captivating voice (must get Winningham's CDs!). She is played brilliantly by Mare Willingham, who was justly nominated for an Oscar for it. As for Leigh, she won best actress awards from the New York Film Critics Circle Awards (highly prestigious in the USA), and the Montreal Film Festival. Leigh can sing better than she does in the film because it is part of the role that she must not be very good. However, she throws herself totally into every song she sings, and unbearably heart-rending emotion is her specialty. What a contrast to the cold control shown by her sister, who stands erect and formal, while Leigh throws herself all over the stage and repeatedly swallows and vomits up the microphone, and everything hangs out like long johns on the washing line which the neighbours don't want to see. The film is incredibly sensitive and profound, a triumph by Ulu Grosbard, who made too few films in his career, and is now well into his 80s. This is REAL film-making, and one of the endless parade of spectacular achievements by the incomparably brilliant Jennifer Jason Leigh, and surely one of her best. Jennifer Jason Leigh here pulls off another of her 'impossible' performances. Is there any film actress as versatile as she is? Is there anything she can't do or any role she cannot play? When she acts, she throws herself into the role with the force of an express train. Here she transforms into a hopeless, cheery, ever-smiling flop of a girl, who has failed at everything but just goes on in good humour, taking it on the chin from Life time after time. Her pathetic, sprawling, inept character is endlessly endearing, like a delightful child, even though she drives everyone she knows crazy because she is so hopeless. She can't stay off the drugs, or the booze, or out of bed with anyone for a quickie. She doesn't know when to start, she doesn't know when to stop. She is behaviour-dyslexic. Her thoroughly controlled and successful older sister gets her revenge on little sister by extending icy and permanent tolerance, disguising condescension as devotion. The two sisters are both singers, and the older one, Georgia of the title (though the star is really Sadie, the Leigh character), is a magnificent folk singer with a marvellously controlled and captivating voice (must get Winningham's CDs!). She is played brilliantly by Mare Willingham, who was justly nominated for an Oscar for it. As for Leigh, she won best actress awards from the New York Film Critics Circle Awards (highly prestigious in the USA), and the Montreal Film Festival. Leigh can sing better than she does in the film because it is part of the role that she must not be very good. However, she throws herself totally into every song she sings, and unbearably heart-rending emotion is her specialty. What a contrast to the cold control shown by her sister, who stands erect and formal, while Leigh throws herself all over the stage and repeatedly swallows and vomits up the microphone, and everything hangs out like long johns on the washing line which the neighbours don't want to see. The film is incredibly sensitive and profound, a triumph by Ulu Grosbard, who made too few films in his career, and is now well into his 80s. This is REAL film-making, and one of the endless parade of spectacular achievements by the incomparably brilliant Jennifer Jason Leigh, and surely one of her best."

I liked it but it doesn't have the stuff to make it to my higher favoritism of movies. Frank Oz is imaginative, but I have to say that this film to me is not so Frank Oz, and movies that are adapted from books are quite impressive, but I can only say I was slightly impressed. For one thing, the cast is inadequate, I never heard of David Keith and Litefoot.

This story follows Omri, an extremely childish youngster who, for his birthday, receives a MAGICAL (ooh!) cupboard. The Cupboard lacks its key so Omri's mother (actress Lindsay Crouse, never heard of her), gives him her collection of keys, and guess what¬Ö? He finds the certain key on his second try! That part always took me aback. He puts in an antique Iroquois figure in the cupboard, and later in the morning he opens it to find the figure alive as a small Iroquois man. The pair has many tedious adventures, some including an idiotic rat ball and a down-right scruffy cowboy who was a toy figure too. The cupboard MAGICALLY turns plastic (plaz-teck!) things into their real life counterparts, only smaller. The pair soon learns that every boy must become a man (a typical, yet true moral).

Omri's character really is childish, yet endearing; his parents seem to pamper him, he's afraid of the dark, and he has lame 90's action figures; but he does mellow out in the end of the movie. I liked the acting, but it was no To Kill a Mocking Bird, even at moving parts. The Iroquois man was different from other Indian movies; he was a guru in a way. The music was just moderate and odd, though with one exception you'll know when you hear it.

Be warned, my dear readers, this movie contains slight profanity (embarrassing really); simulative killing and some ladies do a loathsome dance on TV at one point (they call this a kid movie, how embarrassing. Let's hope Omri was sleeping at that adultish scene). And no the kid does not play God, its just a story, have fun. Other than the 3 points I pointed out, the movie is plucky and it has a rather moving ending. It's an poorish if okay movie.

I know almost nothing about fashion and have difficulty getting into documentaries. I did see this years ago, about the time it hit video, and while I liked Isaac, the movie didn't hold my interest.

Fast forward to 2008, I've been watching Ugly Betty for two seasons. It is another unlikely choice for me, but it's over the top enough to be fun. Everyone around me loves The Devil Wears Prada, so I've seen that several times as well.

Then Unzipped reappears on satellite TV, and as I watch it I see a first hand look at the world that Betty and Devil are only reflecting. Seeing it in this context I found a whole new appreciation for this movie. It's interesting, funny and dramatic in places, and it's beautifully shot. Maybe there are a lot of documentary clich√©s at work here, but who better to give the glamorous black and white treatment to than supermodels and fashionistas? It works, extremely well, now I understand better where it comes from. Why settle for an 'inspired by' Anna Wintour when you can have the real thing?

High praise and my sincere gratitude go to the director and writers for delivering two charming characters, superb writing, always interesting and witty dialogs, two awesome performances, and the atmosphere of magic that falling in love is.

He was nominated for Nobody's Fool but I have the feeling that was more of a sympathy or guilt nomination from the academy .

Don't get me wrong , his performance is good , It was probably his last good performance in fact, but the film itself is a bit too fluffy for me.

Paul Newman a stubborn man past his prime reflects on his life of strict independence and seeks more from himself.

He realises that he's not been a great father , in fact no father at all , so perhaps he can make up for that ?

Considering this was nominated twice for academy awards it's surprising how it feels like a Sunday afternoon made for TV film.

That's not a criticism, it just feels like that and lots of people like those type of films.

Newman plays this role very naturally and I was pleased he didn't try to make this comedic.

It has its serious moments and it's lighthearted moments and it's very watchable .

There is a great cast . Bruce Willis ( who chews up the scenery) , Melanie Griffith, who gives us a nice little flash ! , A young Phillip Seymour Hoffman and the last ever performance from Jessica Tandy , in fact she died before it was released.

The film is initially dull and boring. 7 minutes into the film and not one word is said! Though silence enhances the cultural rift between Mr Chu and Martha, the silence is probably too long. As the film progresses, more cultural differences are displayed. It is striking that during dinner, Martha and Jeremy uses forks to eat while Mr Chu and Alex uses chopsticks. Another striking scene is when Mr Chu and Mrs Chan talk in the community centre towards the end of the film, behind Mr Chu is an American flag while behind Mrs Chan it is a piece of Chinese calligraphy. Such subtle display of cultural differences is clever. The film is also heavy on Chinese traditional ideas, such as children taking care of parents as a natural duty, parents not wanting to burden children of their troubles etc. Such cultural ideas are beautifully explored.

It is a pity that this film is shot with a very low budget. There are even three occasions that the boom mike is visible. Fortunately, such imperfections do not hinder my enjoyment.

I'm well aware at how well Dazed and Confused was received, getting 5/5 ratings from the majority of viewers. I guess that means I just missed something about it and it didn't work for me.

It's about the last day of school in an American High School, back in 1976. The older students are looking forward to generally beating up the younger kids (as is tradition... apparently - all I can say is that this didn't happen to me at school in Britain during the eighties and nineties and I'm glad it didn't!).

I found most of the characters either unlikeable or boring. I found it hard to root for someone who enjoys bullying people smaller than them (which is most of the older kids), just as I found it harder to identify with the younger ones who just sort of spent most of the film running away or waiting to take a hiding. Plus there's no real story. What you have here is a collection of scenes with numerous different characters all doing their own things on the last day of school. There's also too many characters. Many don't really have much impact and aren't really fleshed out enough to be believed in. I think it would have benefited with a smaller cast. Although, the cast is pretty impressive - maybe not when this movie was made, but, in retrospect, there are a fair few Hollywood A-listers all here in the younger (pre-fame) days.

However, as much as I didn't really like it, I had to give it credit for getting the 'look' of the period right on. It really could have been filmed in the seventies for the way it was presented. Plus the soundtrack was right up my street. For once a film set in the seventies didn't have a single Abba track involved and there was far more use of some 'classic rock anthems' such as Alice Cooper (hooray!).

I didn't hate it, I just didn't like it as much as everyone else apparently did.

Nunez's writing and direction is an honest and personal observation of the identity crisis we face when our dreams are halted by the stark realities of life. As we follow Ruby through her experiences in heartbreak, failure, and anxiety, we find a narrative that is comfortingly familiar to anyone's own life. Nunez does not reach for a fast-paced action, or otherworldly setting, but rather keeps us grounded in neighbor's pies and dead tourist shops, allowing a unique connection with the audience by not asking them to escape from the mundanity of their lives, but rather find gratitude in the simplicity of living. Ashley Judd's performance as Ruby is likeable, subtle, and earnest, giving prominence to intuitive acting. By simply existing within the scene, Judd elevates Nunez's writing to focus on the journey within rather than the consequences of big external events. Ruby in Paradise impresses by inviting a connection on a genuine human level not necessarily specific to gender or identity, making it worth revisiting 28 years later.

Fred Astaire was well advanced in his 50s when he made this film, and Audrey Hepburn was twenty years younger, and yet their peculiar romance works, although they make diametrically contrary characters, he a fast photographer for a fashion magazine and she a very intellectual librarian. But the question is if it is not Kay Thompson that makes this film. She was in very few films, and this one was her third and last major performance (in her 40s), and although she was not a real film star at all, she absolutely dominates the film. Although it's a very flimsy and superficial intrigue, the dialog is brilliant throughout, especially as Audrey all the time keeps spicing it with her philosophical conversation, which actually gets Kay Thompson intrigued in it was well, and it all turns out into some psychological education, as they all learn something about empathy - Audrey is the teacher, or rather the informer and awakener, while Fred and Kay never heard of such a thing before, but they do learn. To all this comes the marvellous old music of George Gershwin and the absolutely splendid direction by Stanley Donen. Every time I have seen this film (since 1958, the first time,) I have loved it even more, for its charm will keep growing with you and within you. It is all too obvious, and you can't miss it in the film, that Audrey Hepburn loved making this film with Fred Astaire, and she admitted that herself on TV decades afterwards. The imagination, the innovations, the variation of the performances and playacting, the intoxicatingly beautiful settings - everything combines in making this film one of the most precious jewels in all film musical history, and it will keep growing in its invaluable preciousness.

It was composed by Harry Warren and Harold Adamson and it's one of the great movie themes of all time. Guaranteed to put you in the mood for romance and tears.

This version with Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr sticks pretty close to the original with Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne. Two people, each engaged to others, meet on shipboard and fall in love. It's one of those chemical things that no one can help.

Grant's a playboy who candidly admits he's never worked a day in his life and Kerr wants a bit more security than that. They agree to meet at the top of the Empire State Building in exactly six months to see if the sparks are still there. But something is always interrupting the course of history and romance.

Can't say much more than that, but as Kerr reminds Grant if they don't meet it will be for a darn good reason and if you see the film you'll agree she had one.

This was the second of three films that Grant and Kerr made together and this is easily the best of them. I don't think Cary Grant was ever more romantic on the screen and that is saying something.

Cathleen Nesbitt though old enough to be his mother, plays Cary's grandmother in grand old world style. Her part had previously been played by Maria Ouspenskaya and later on in the Warren Beatty-Annette Bening remake was done by Katharine Hepburn.

The only decent thing in this film is the scenery. The plot, such as it is, is predictable and boring in the extreme.

As brilliant a filmmaker as he remains, every one of his films has its own shortcomings that leave it in the ""near-perfect"" category. In a way it feels as though he purposely leaves something unnecessary in each time out. For this reason among others, Sayles' films are an acquired taste. His 1992 film ""Passion Fish"" struts along at a very self-assured, yet slow paced gait, much like the population of its Southern Gothic location.

The main focus of the film is put on two women, one who returns to the place she left to dwell upon her current challenges and another who comes there for refuge from her troubles elsewhere. The women's paths intersect at a precarious point in their lives, leading to some very interesting results. Mary McDonnell stars as May-Alice, a feisty, soap actress forced into early retirement by a car accident. It's a challenging role and she brings a certain bravado that hasn't been shown by her previously. Alfre Woodard gives a highly nuanced performance as the nurse who has been hired to help the reluctant May-Alice.

Like in many of Sayles' films, given his immense prowess as a writer, the true pleasure comes not from watching the main storyline but the local and supporting flavor chewing up scenery throughout. One such gem involves an outdoor luncheon with McDonnell's character attempting to keep her composure and a tactful face with two Southern Belle types she hates. It's moments like this that add texture to Sayles' films, but also tend to keep them loosely edited and occasionally overwrought.

If you must know the threadbare plot follows 16-year old Nicole Walker, played by Reese Witherspoon. Sure is a long way from this garbage to an Academy Award for Miss Witherspoon. But I digress. Anyhow, young Nicole falls in love with seemingly sweet, nice, perfectly charming David McCall, played by Mark Wahlberg who somehow managed to salvage an acting career after appearing in this movie and thus was spared a lifetime of ""Whatever happened to that Marky Mark guy"" questions. Of course if David is as seemingly wonderful as he initially seems this movie would have a different title. As it is, David soon reveals himself to be a murderous lunatic and everybody does not in fact live happily ever after.

So what's wrong with this movie you ask? In a nutshell, everything. The script is terrible, with some of the most god-awful dialogue ever heard. The characters are all clich√©d, pulled straight out of so many similar and infinitely better movies that had come before. This film has nothing new to offer, it's just a painfully bad rehash. It's meant to be suspenseful and shocking. In fact it's just laughable. Nothing here is believable, the whole thing is over to the top to the point of stupidity. Don't even get me started on why Nicole's completely ordinary family lives in a home with more security features than Fort Knox. It's downright ludicrous, an artificial attempt to make the climax of the film more dramatic. Unfortunately by the film's climax you'll be stifling yawns. If you haven't already given up and turned the thing off. You get the sense everyone involved with this movie would like to forget it ever happened. If you ever are unlucky enough to have to sit through it you'll wish you could forget it too. Well this is about as bad as movies get. Nothing to see here, move along.

While the attractive Mary Stuat Masterson is his old flame, a blond stripper who still has feelings for Dave.

All these esteemed actors give a good showing in their own right but their characters are flat and lifeless. The script seems compelled only to move the action along and nothing else. Mr. Caine, Mr. Nicholson and Ms. Davis give punctuation and try their best to put a breath of life into this lifeless film with an all too obvious plot.

Stephen Dorff gives a better performance than usual (no cheers for Blade or Cecil B. Demented) but his character is far from complex, and Jennifer Lopez can't keep her faux Cuban accent up throughout the course of the film.

The plot is rather generic and the suspense that the movie is trying to portray is better invoked by the musical score than the cinematic or script climax.

As a saving grace the location scouting is great, really espousing the feeling of the Floridian backdrop. But that doesn't save the movie. There are as well a couple of slightly memorable stunt scenes but is not an action film.

Skip this one and watch Chinatown again. And if you haven't seen that see it twice.

This is a 747-200! not a 747-400. The cockpit should have gouges, switches, and a flight engineer station, rather than having computers. How can a 747 have very little passengers on a holiday? Why would the police transport a convict on a civilian airliner? I thought that convicts should be transported on a Boeing 727 (like the one they used in the film Eraser and U.S. Marshals) rather than a Boeing 747, unless there are more than 300 convicts. Why would the autopilot kill the pilot? Pretty stupid invention. I tested what would happened if a Boeing 747-200 would do if flies upside down on Flight Simulator ( by Microsoft not the real one). The 747 would lose a lot of altitude instead of flying at leveled altitude, And there is no way a 747 would have an outside viewing window in the avionics bay. Neither does it have a sliding door on the staircase to block access to the upper deck. The staircase of a 747-200 is not suppose to be straight it's suppose to be spiral styled. Even the Tower Air 747 ( the aircraft that Capt. Bowen flies while helping Teri to fly the plane ) has the same stuff like the Trans Con 747. Most of the scenes in Turbulence has been placed in films like, Turbulence 2 and 3 and Ground Control. Turbulence 2 and 3 all have something in common, and that is their destination is always LAX. I really don't like this film, but I like to keep on watching it whenever there is nothing to watch on TV. Turbulence, it's such a stupid, pointless movie. The aircraft, a Trans Con 747-200, has the controls of a 747-400. This is a 747-200! not a 747-400. The cockpit should have gouges, switches, and a flight engineer station, rather than having computers. How can a 747 have very little passengers on a holiday? Why would the police transport a convict on a civilian airliner? I thought that convicts should be transported on a Boeing 727 (like the one they used in the film Eraser and U.S. Marshals) rather than a Boeing 747, unless there are more than 300 convicts. Why would the autopilot kill the pilot? Pretty stupid invention. I tested what would happened if a Boeing 747-200 would do if flies upside down on Flight Simulator ( by Microsoft not the real one).

989,Cats Don't Dance (1997),26-Mar-1997,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['Animation', ""Children's"", 'Musical']"," In 1997, Warner Bros. and Ted Turner released an animated musical feature called Cats Don't Dance, which was intended as a tribute to Hollywood musicals from the 1930s. With direction from Mark Dindal (who would go on to make The Emperor's New Groove) and some choreography taught by the legend himself, Gene Kelly, this seemed like a sure fire hit....that is if it really were. While the film was decently well received by critics, it wasn't marketed very well and sadly flopped at the box office. Luckily, it has garnished a cult following over the years, and after seeing it myself, I can more than ever see why.

Set in Hollywood in the late 1930s, the film centers around the optimistic and talented cat Danny who wants to make it into showbiz. The only issue, he's a cat and all other animals are only treated as second rate props behind human actors, including the nasty Darla Dimple. Upon getting into trouble with Ms. Dimple, Danny decides to bring all the animals together to make it big in the movies. Yeah, right off the bat, the plot is rather predictable and it's not so different from the usual underdog story we normally see in some animated movies. That being said, the film makes up for the weak plot with some highly entertaining scenes and jokes, fast paced animation, likable characters, and a true passion for Hollywood.

In terms of the characters, Danny is the highly ambitious albeit naive protagonist who wishes to be a star, even if he has to fight hard to get his dream, which is something many people still go through today so he is a little sympathetic. Sawyer is the disillusioned albeit beautiful white cat who neglects Danny's hopes at first, but soon supports him and the other animals to become big as well. Also, can I just say that Danny and Sawyer are absolutely adorable? I love cats as it is, but they are so charming and delightful to watch....anyway, the rest are rather one dimensional, but are still humorous in their own right, like the giddy Tillie, the bad tempered curmudgeon Cranston, the superstitious T.W., and the chubby albeit charming Pudge.

And then there's Darla Dimple, who is absolutely hilarious from her voice to her design. As she is a parody of Shirley Temple, she may seem like an adorable animal loving angel, but she's really an egotistical monster who will do whatever it takes to sabotage the animals just so she can be the big shot. In addition, her butler Max just cracks me up almost every time, mainly from how huge and deadpan he is. Speaking of Darla's prejudice of animals, the most interesting thing about the story itself is how, as stated before, the animals are viewed. Many of the animals themselves have dreams to be big in the theater, but they're sadly looked down upon by the humans who top them. If not for the fact that they were animals, this film probably could have been a social commentary on how African Americans were mistreated in showbiz until the 1960s....damn, this film is smart.

As for the animation, in accordance to the film's upbeat and whimsical tone, the general style is reminiscent to the Looney Tunes and cartoons by Tex Avery. The characters are designed from the ground up to be cartoony, and their fast paced squash & stretch movements are perfectly timed. Not to mention, given how Gene Kelly did some choreography for the animators, the dance moves are superb, really bringing out a lot of jive and soul from each animal. The way the movie recreates Hollywood is solid enough, but the dance movements bring out that extra flavor of fun for the audience. It's also cool how the film utilizes a perfectly contrasted color scheme to set the tone: saturated when optimistic and happy and neutralized when sad and hopeless.

Now I will admit, the musical numbers done by Randy Newman are rather hit or miss. Some like I Do Believe, Danny's Arrival Song and Tell Me Lies do come at their given times and are well directed and choreographed, but they don't leave enough impact to be memorable enough to sing along to. That being said, others like Animal Jam, Big and Loud, and especially Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now are highly entertaining, catchy and worth getting off your seat and just dancing to. The last one mentioned is a special highlight, not just because of the shenanigans Darla Dimple gets herself into, but also by the jazzy and upbeat tone that stands as a true finale highlight, complete with solid colors, lyrics, and dances. So yeah, the songs are either average or very good, but the good ones stick out more.

I don't know how this film would have gone had it been marketed properly, but I do know that it would have been somewhat of a classic. Cats Don't Dance is a highly entertaining and fun feature that stands as an enjoyable tribute and rendition to musicals from Hollywood's golden era. Even if the plot is fairly standard and most of the characters aren't particularly grand, the wacky fast paced animation, lovable main protagonists and antagonists, catchy songs, and comedic tone make it an enjoyable feature worth your time. If you're a fan of Hollywood movies from the 30s and 40s, musicals, animated features with talking animals, or even cartoony animation, then definitely seek this one out for the whole family.

The religion of the ancient Greeks cannot be described as active, and thus is fair game for irreverent revisions that will offend very few beside Hellenist scholars.

Animated and live-action films that illustrate current religions, however, must adhere to tradition. Only look at the wealth of Hindu devotional films, visualized scriptures that provide ample evidence of the present-day believer's faith in the miraculous. Animated versions make these treasured tales of the gods more accessible to children. This is a living religion, with about a billion followers worldwide, and the third largest faith today.

But a 'dead' religion has virtually no one to protect its integrity, and so its miracles become myths, and its myths become infinitely flexible.

I suppose it's best for the tender sensibilities of children to present Zeus as a nice monogamous papa-god, whose only son was borne by his wife Hera.

This film has a cast of excellent actors who portray tragedy and comedy with sublime skill. The script is heartfelt and funny. There is no mockery of recovery programs or the self-help movement.

AL Franken's deadpan deliver of Stuart's ridiculous, but charming self is the the heart of the movie. But equally good are Piper Laurie, Vincent D'Onofrio, Lesley Boone & Harris Yulin.

Surprisingly, (Melora Walters) looked super cute. The sailors' team delivered so right performance. Nothing was over the top, or goofy in a bad way. All the elements harmonized to make the jest good. It even managed to be a story about a boy turning into a man along the way too.

This kind of comedies used to be twisted, disgusting, poor, or easy, whatever. But Cabin Boy isn't any of that. It's joyful, yet in loyally childish way; which can be the secret of it indeed.

It was a chore to sit through.

That actually may be a stretch even for that age. I'm all for slapstick ridiculousness, but there isn't even the faintest hint of wit or cleverness. I have an idea, lets take bad uninspired obvious jokes and play them at twice the speed. Now that's funny. Ha. Ha.

It was a chore to sit through. The ""jokes"" were uninspired rehashes from other, better shows and movies, and Leguizamo's manic portrayal of this obnoxious character should only appeal to age ten and below. That actually may be a stretch even for that age. I'm all for slapstick ridiculousness, but there isn't even the faintest hint of wit or cleverness. I have an idea, lets take bad uninspired obvious jokes and play them at twice the speed. Now that's funny. Ha. Ha.

Movies that you should see that take silly humor and add comic timing and originality: The Marx Brothers' A Night at the Opera, Monty Python's The Meaning of Life, South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut,...and the list goes on. Don't lose an hour and a half of your life on unmemorable crap.

By the way, I can only assume that the reason that David Bar Katz (the other writer) did VERY little in film after this movie is because he was instantly blacklisted. I'm actually impressed that Leguizamo was able to recover after this mess."

I'm starting to wonder how the hostiles were designated ""hostile"" when there were so many of these stand-up-and-be-heard PC types running around. (In the army, no less, which is just the place *I* would go if I wanted to find to a peaceful solution with the native American people.) I do wish that the movies would just show what happened without the characters of Basil Exposition and The Preacher, so we can form our own conclusions.

This movie is no exception, focusing on the Apache War, with Jason Patric playing Lt. Gatewood - speaking the very language of the Apache - pointing out to his commanding officer the errors of Indian policy. Matt Daman trots along in his wake and explains other concerns helpfully. Both look sincere and concerned, with Jason showing religious fervor and Matt looking terribly naive. Robert Duvall is excellent (as always); Wes Studi is solid as Geronimo.

The scenery (if you neglect to note the transportation implications as they race from one lovely monument several hours by car to another while raiding in the space of minutes) is lovely, and the soldiers look suitably tired and scruffy. I did find it dreadfully distracting (sorry to be so obsessive) that each actor had a mouthful of beautiful white teeth in the 1800s when dental care was a mere rumour.

And the facts. Well, so, as one reviewer pointed out, we weren't there, but we do know some details because the people that were there kept diaries and wrote letters, and we can compare what people wrote, and they all agreed on certain things. Unfortunately, Hollywood used what was handy and ignored a few important details.

So now some viewers will probably think they know something about Geronimo's life that isn't true, especially the poor junior high school kid cheating on some report by watching the movie. It's just irresponsible for movie makers to distort basic and important facts for the sake of the story.

This movie was beautifully photographed, well acted, and brings visibility in an highly poignant fashion to the suffering of the Native American to those who may have missed all the other movies. If they'd ridden their horses just a little closer to the facts, they would have had a much tighter story on Geronimo.

We saw this film when it was originally released, but caught it recently in the retrospect of Mr. Guest's films shown recently here.

""Waiting for Guffman"" is, to this humble viewer, probably his best creation to date. Not only is this a funny movie, it shows the genius of Mr. Guest at his best.

Corky St. Clair, the director from the New York stage seems completely out of place in Blaine, Mo. He is too witty for that small little town, where he is clearly adored, not only by the local thespians, but by the whole municipal council. Some of the lines one hears coming from Corky's mouth are so amazing that one wonders if the citizens of Blaine fully realize they have a gem living in town.

The players auditioning for Corky's new production about Blaine's beginnings, live in a world of themselves. Ron and Sheila Albertson, are the star of other productions, so they return again for the new show. Libby Mae Brown works in the Dairy Queen, but her ambition is to be a star. Even the local dentist, Dr. Allan Pearl, is attracted to become a performer.

There are two other underlying plots going on in the film. There is the history part, or how Blaine came to be, and the other notorious incident of the flying saucer that came into town and took several of the citizens for a tour of the space craft and we are being told about it by the people that experienced that adventure.

Christopher Guest makes a wonderful Corky St. Clair. Mr. Guest knows what makes Corky great. Corky, no doubt, is a composite of people Mr. Guest must have known at one time or another. Corky is an enormous achievement for Mr. Guest as a writer and as a performer.

Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara are incredible in their take of the Albertsons, the travel agents without a clue of what's going on outside Blaine. Ron's delicate operation is explained in some detail to the horrified Mrs. Pearl. Eugene Levy, Mr. Guest's frequent collaborator is right on the money as the dentist with singing aspirations. Parker Posey, is the girl who thinks Broadway is only a few steps away. Paul Dooley, Don Lake, Larry Miller,Linda Kash, are among the citizens of Blaine one gets to know in the film.

Of course, none of this would have been possible without Christopher Guest. It's a shame we don't get to see more of him, but that makes even better whatever he decides to offer us from time to time.

Because it portrays its subject matter with such skill, one's opinion on the film likely says something about one's ideas on those matters, and setting aside these opinions will probably yield a much more moderate take on the film. At least it does for me.

Now: as a presentation of the events that led to Warhol's shooting, this film was brilliant. Its portrayal of Solanas's and Warhol's motivations and ideas is done with compassion and clarity; I particularly enjoyed its characterization of Warhol, which, in my opinion, was quite complimentary, contrary to some other opinions expressed on this board. He approaches things with an endearingly childlike innocence, a willingness to accept anything as beautiful... Well, some people might not find that complimentary... Nonetheless, it is his hangers on who come across as cruel and unpleasant. And of course, Lili Taylor plays the idiosyncratic Solanas marvelously.

Unfortunately, the focus on the context of the events causes the film to suffer as a narrative. Many of the mood generating scenes, while providing considerable insight into the characters, seem directionless and unsure. This would not be a problem had they been more visually or emotionally compelling, but as it is, they are only occasionally composed as anything other than simple, plot-furthering shots. The result is that the film seems digressive and unfocused, and this digression mars what could have been a fascinating film.

In the end, though, this is certainly a film worth watching, if you're willing to pay attention, especially when one of its more striking images comes to the surface.

Bernardo Bertolucci again masterfully weaves this story in his usual poetically-visual style of directing. You feel like he's given everything he has and more to tell this story. It's told mainly from the main character's point of view, which is amazing in itself, but is possibly why the screenplay was written by a woman, Susan Minot. The story begins as Lucy arrives at her destination with a diary of her late mother's in hand. She reads thru this as a means to get to know her mother better(we get the feeling that she was not as close to her as she would have liked to be). The trip is also a way to explore this by getting to know her from the people who were close to her. The trip was the gift from her father, whom she has never met, and thus begins another search for her. Her virginity is also a hot topic, but mostly from those around her. She had only kissed a boy five years prior when she visited before and is still infatuated with him and hopes he will be the one(if you know what I mean). Since her mother's death she has closed herself up in many ways, and this has been one of them(although she denies this). Every character in this story is full of life in one way or another and seems to know their place in it except Lucy. And that's basically what this story is about. Her self discovery and her finding her place in the history of her family. The Italian landscape provides breathtaking views that Bertolucci takes great advantage of, the modern music blended with classical makes for an awesome soundtrack, and of course the storytelling plays it's way to a wonderful ending that leaves you again wanting to know these people more and more. This is where Bertolucci succeeds so well. His characters are rich and full of stories like real people who are merely here to enjoy their life.

Julian Schnabel, a New York based painter, turned film director, decided to make Jean Michel Basquiat the subject of his first time at the helm in the new role. The result is a film that shows us a young artist in search of an identity when he was breaking as a painter.

Jean Michel Basquiat was a success story, as far as his art was concerned. He clearly became a big force in the New York art scene. We watch him as he goes from a struggling young man to the success he became, and ultimately killed him. Some people can cope with fame and wealth, but others, like Jean Michel couldn't. History is full of cases like this one troubled young man who died too soon.

As far as Basquiat's art, well, that's in the eye of whoever is seeing it. Some will say it was trash, while others, like it seems to be the case with the director, tells us otherwise. Some of his pieces are overwhelming in their intensity.

The only reason for watching this film is Jeffrey Wright, an actor's actor. Mr. Wright is seen almost sleepwalking through the film. He seems to be on a permanent fog, as he didn't relate too well to all the hangers-on of that world. David Bowie as Andy Warhol made a tremendous impression. Benicio del Toro is only seen briefly. The rest of the cast do whatever they can under the unsure direction of Mr. Schnabel.

It's a knock-off of many films of The Nineties, its closest 'relative'; being Pulp Fiction. A bunch of characters, a seemingly disparate group of stories, all coming together for a grand finale. When I first saw it I thought, How modern. I thought, Brilliant plotting. Now I see it and think, Contrived. Very contrived. As for the characters, they're just too broad, too stereotypical. In fact I had the sense that the film-makers (Director, Screenwriters) were quite in love with themselves; their cleverness, their cynicism.

Here's the story. An athlete is murdered. One of the two murderers tries to kill the other murderer, but fails. The two murders go their separate ways, meet different people many of whom have some a vague relationship to one another. Of course the two murderers will meet again, each bringing with him the people they've been with. And this forms the grand finale in which someone's gotta die. And does.

James Spader is terrific as Murderer #1.

Likewise Danny Aiello as Murderer #2.

Glenn Headley is impossible not to love as the assistant to a no-good Hollywood-type.

Paul Mazursky steals the show as a down-and-out suicidal former film director with a great little dog.

Terry Hatcher is fine as the dead athlete's girlfriend who may be harboring an important secret regarding the murder. And this was a problem for me, an inconsistency in the plot. If she is involved with the murder, then scenes of her first reaction to the murder are .... 'off'.

Charlize Theron as girlfriend to Murderer #1 is also fine, but nowhere near as good as she's gonna be over the following decades.

Overall, it's OK. Only just. On my latest viewing I had the sense that it was meant to be a longer film but, at the last minute, was edited down. I say this as the pace - early-on it's quite slow - seems to pick up as we approach the ninety minute mark; the bringing together of all the characters seems a large, hastily concocted, device.

But maybe it's that I've seen it too many times.

Watch it yourself. See if you agree. Each time I watch 'Two Days in the Valley' I like it less.

A crew making a documentary set sail down a tropical river, on their way losing their fuel and, you guessed it, bumping into a big snake. There are all the usual characters here: beautiful girl, villain, posh English bloke (there's always one!), working-class hero, etc. They gradually get picked off one-by-one - although guessing the next ""victim"" is so easy, it takes the fun out of it all.

There are a few oddities in the consistency of the plot. Most of the killing happen in the second half of the film with the first half devoted to boring sub-plots. Curiously, the customary ""introduction shock"" is not a snake death, but a suicide. We never really find out why this has happened - after all, there is still a lot of Jennifer Lopez to be shown - and this, I think, is one of the main problems with the film. Story lines are attempted but never completed and so the audience will never gain true satisfaction from the film.

Another interesting factor is Terri's boyfriend and his contribution to the story line. During a dive, he gets bitten and the crew manage to recover him. They save his life but he is still unconscious and remains so throughout most of the movie.

However, the weakest character of all is the snake. Sure, it's pretty ugly, but it will never be truly terrifying as the director doesn't play on our sense of fear. We may be surprised when the snake attacks but never truly shocked.

As I said before, this isn't too bad a movie (I've seen worse) - there are some moments of tension, the actors do their jobs and the special effects are far from laughable. You might want to watch this if it's shown of TV, but I wouldn't pay money to see it. This is not as bad as some people say it is.

1015,Shiloh (1997),23-May-1997,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[""Children's"", 'Drama']"," We all have those classic movies about animals that we watched when we were little ones, and hopefully if you've got any senses about you, still revisit as an adult. Well, most people have a few of those... I've got at least like twenty. One couple of movies that are very dear to me are Shiloh, and Shiloh 2: Shiloh Season, two indisputable classics that I was pretty much raised on, and have a burning nostalgia for. Shiloh boils down to one simple, loving archetype: a boy and his dog. Or, rather, a boy who desperately wishes to save a dog from going down the same road of violence and abuse that it's currant owner has. Marty Preston (Blake Heron, and Zachary Browne in the sequel because they just can't stick with one actor) is a young rural lad with a wholesome life and family, wishing for a dog of his own. Local roughneck and hunter Judd Travers (Scott Wilson) owns a whole pack of mutts that he mistreats when drunk, and aims to turn them all into vicious hunting dogs. When one small beagle escapes, it makes its way onto Preston land and suddenly Marty finds he has a new best friend. His stern father Ray (inimitable Michael Moriarty) warns him that the dog is probably Judd's, while his mother (excellent character actress Ann Dowd) urges compassion from her husband. Soon enough Judd comes looking, and conflict arises between the boy and the bitter old hunter. It's a children's story so nothing too messed up ever happens, but there's some touching lessons and surprising gravitas from both Moriarty and Wilson that is nice to see from such a seemingly innocuous, kid oriented franchise. Judd shows beautiful complexity in the sequel, the writing allowing Wilson to illustrate that not all mean people started out that way, and that with a little kindness and a lot of patience, old wounds can be burrowed into and treated. I first became a fan of Scott through the Shiloh films and he will always be Judd Travers to me. Marty finds a friend in Shiloh, getting right to the point of what these movies are about: friendship. New friends, old friends, and letting people in who need someone and don't even know it. It's great stuff, timeless to be sure, and always guaranteed to draw forth a smile. Rod Steiger lends his famous kind streak to the role of Doc Wallace, a convenience store owner with sagely wisdom for Marty and his fellow friends, as well as compassion for Judd. Now, there's a third film, also with Wilson but yet another different actor for Marty, and Moriarty sitting it out as well, which is why I haven't checked it out so far. Maybe it's time.

It's got plenty of action, big explosions, one-liners and pure entertainment value. The plot is pretty good, somewhat original, and fairly fast-paced. The acting is good, and the film has a surprisingly large amount of well-known good actors; Nicolas Cage, John Cusack, Danny Trejo, Steve Buscemi, Ving Rhames and John Malkovich. They all give good performances, as do most of the supporting actors. The characters are well-written and credible. I found it interesting how most of the characters aren't all black or white in their actions and personalities; many of them have a shade of gray or two. The action is well-done, exciting and intense. The special effects(the few there are) are good enough. The ending may be a little extreme, but it's a good climax, and the good things in the film make up for the bad; granted, there are a few downright lame parts, but there are far more good parts than bad. All in all, everything you'd expect from a Jerry Bruckheimer action film, and nothing else. I recommend it to fans of standard action films. 7/10 Con Air is what I've come to expect of a standard Hollywood action flick, nothing more, nothing less.

Not a lot as It seemed but that's not the point. Just sit back - preferably with a lager and allow Tree's Lounge to charm your trousers off.

Wonderfully subdued comedy showing that Buscemi Is not only a cult anti hero on screen but that he has much promise as a director. The characters stand out as they can be related to - everyone will recognise the Bill type regular permanently attached to the counter. Mark Boone's wife also as a seriously difficult woman who hasn't a clue what she really wants, stereotypically so. Tommy yes, Is a manchild aimlessly squandering his life away, for sure It Isn't a good role model to aspire to approaching middle age but hey that's his perogative.

This Is Steve's film and he's got charisma by the barrow full to make Tree's Lounge a real treat. That trick with the glasses will work once - provided your not too hammered practising. But It's Uncle Al who gets the best lines - ""he loves your mothers"", his excuse for his lecherous behaviour on the couch will bail a lot of people out of a lot of trouble.

This film Is very hard to track down, 90% of video shops I went to hadn't even heard of It and It's been on terrestrial Tele twice - once a week late- the reward Is well worth the effort.

But Marina , addictive in all things , soon becomes willing accomplice in Ricky's fantasies . A love story...with strings attached!

Pedro Almod√≥var brings us a very mixed bag of outlandish characters , rapid dialogs , and absurd situations on a luxury flat and at a shooting , including R-rated sex scenes . Almodovar goes back to the darkest terrain of ¬®Law of Desire¬® , concentrating on the relationship between soft-porn actress Marina and two men who attempt to control her . The more benign is her director -nicely played by veteran Francisco Rabal- in the movie-within-the movie , a genial , wheelchair-bound obsessive who leaves romantic messages on her answering machine and beguiles his lonely hours watching her masturbate on video . Austerily enjoyable and brightly colored film that contains wisted comedy , drama , thrills , chills , and haunting resultings . It can be very funny and very dramatic at the same time , so it was the perfect combination for me . In this peculiar flick Almod√≥var established again his uniquely poetic and visually striking style . Almodovar turns a standard hostage thriller into a grim examination of the power games implicit in a couple , including Stockholm Syndrome . The story is not massively strong , but it is not bad either , as Almod√≥var strings a few o different threads together and that , along with tension and skin going on throughout tends to ensure the movie is always interesting and thrilling . There are several naughty sex scenes and others really masochist as sadistic , as he kidnaps her in her apartment , beats her up while he goes out to score drugs for her . Resulting to a very black comedy in the vein of Bu√±uel's ¬®Belle de Jour¬® or subsequent ¬®The Skin I Live In¬® (2011) by Almodovar himself and worthy the comparison. Almodovar withholds all comment , and many will hate his refusal to moralise , others will relish to opportunity to think for themselves . The performance is also standout element of the film . As main cast is pretty good , excels a young Antonio Banderas as the unbalanced but alluring ex-patient who has spent the better part of his life in a psychiatric facility , and Victoria Abril as the tarnished actress who's pursued with pathological obsession . Along with customary actors from Almodovar factory's : Loles Le√≥n , Mar√≠a Barranco , Rossy de Palma , Julieta Serrano and various familiar Spanish faces , such as : Lola Cardona , Emiliano Redondo , Jose Maria Tasso , Manuel Bandera , among others.

Luxurious and colorful cinematography by the prestigious cameraman Jos√© Luis Alcaine . The music by Oscar winner Ennio Morricone , is very good in which it fits the style and feeling of the film . The motion picture was realized in his peculiar style by Pedro Almodovar ; he often uses symbolism and metaphorical techniques to portray circular story lines , though here he directs a special dramedy , including his ordinary touches . Oscar-winning Spanish auteur Pedro Almodovar has made a name for himself with a series of unabashedly melodramatic titles , mixing comedy, drama, sex and violence , getting great successes . The openly homosexual director has shown an affinity for oddballs and outsiders, populating his films with transvestites and all of whom had previously been relegated to the closet. Almodovar directs throughout with splendid zip and he usually portrays strong female characters , gays and transexuals along his life , winning some important international prizes . He also showed a talent for working with women, and throughout his 40 year career has placed notorious actresses such as Penelope Cruz , Marisa Paredes or Victoria Abril . His first feature film, Pepi, Luci, Bom (1980), was made in 16 mm and blown-up to 35 mm for public release . In 1987, he and his brother Agust√≠n Almod√≥var established their own production company : El Deseo, S. A. Almodovar subsequently made other hits , such as : Labyrinth of passions , Law of desire , Women on the verge of a nervous breakdown , Bad education , All about my mother , Talk to her , Broken embraces , The Skin I Live In and many others .

Ten years later, she returns to the house in which it happened with her new husband (Charles Boyer). Something is wrong, though, as her husband, once so kind to her, grows cold and cruel. Furthermore, Bergman begins to lose things, misplace things, and develop a case of kleptomania, or at least that's her husband's explanation. Boyer convinces his wife that she is going insane, that she is sick, and she becomes little more than a shut-in. She becomes paranoid, especially at her maids (the younger of which is played by Angela Lansbury in her first film role). Meanwhile, Joseph Cotten, a detective, gets an inkling that something is up in that household, and that it might be related to the aunt's murder. Gaslight is a very atmospheric film. The black and white cinematography is full of shadows, and there are interesting things going on in the focus. The music is also quite excellent, and very original. Classical music is also used to great effect. The plot is great, although maybe a tiny bit predictable (it didn't harm my enjoyment of the film whatsoever). The performances are top-notch, although Cotten doesn't add much to the picture. I mean, he's good, but his role perhaps isn't the one the original playwright or the screenwriters were most interested in. Anyone probably could have done just as well. Bergman's performances is to be counted amongst her best. Charles Boyer, an actor with whom I am unfamiliar, is so wicked in the film. You hate him, but you've got to admit it's an effective performance! And I can't finish without praising Angela Lansbury. Dame May Whitty also has a nice supporting role, although the role - the comic relief - is sometimes used at a bad time. I don't think, for instance, she should have come back in during the final sequence. Anyway, little flaws don't detract much from this masterpiece. Bravo, Mr. Cukor! 10/10.

They work diligently, unconcerned with how the rest of the world might view their work. The quality of their work is job one and non-negotiable. Underlying that commitment is a view toward the future and what it might look like. They believe that if their work is well-thought out and well-done that they can shape the future. Conversely, they recognize that if their work isn't well-done or executed that it will be forgotten in due time. Mendonca frets about his sculptures existence after he passes on, Brooks sees a future in which robots will exist on the same plane as humans, and Hoover's work with big animals colors his views about man's supremacy. Mendez has learned the importance of co-operation from hairless rats.

All four recognize the tenuousness of life and the importance of always changing. They all see that the unpleasant alternative to evolving is extinction. That is clear from their respect for other forms of consciousness. They are open to other ways of learning and being. The unique social system of hairless mole rats is lauded as a more co-operative way of living. Robots' consciousness also is seen as something which is rapidly developing. The big animals that Hoover trains have their own systems for dealing with their world too. Mendonca's commitment to his job for over 30 years gives him the knowledge that change happens slowly.

The subjects' views on different ways of life are really brought to life against the backdrop of a score by Caleb Sampson. His use of a frequently repeating motif score bought to mind Philip Glass and gave the film a melancholy twinge. Also helpful in creating the mood are schlocky films, many science fiction and adventurous which often play while the four subjects tell their stories about what inspires and has guided them.

Morris is a filmmaker always worth watching. His choice of music, subject, and how he puts everything together makes him one of the most unique filmmakers working. These portraits of men in somewhat unusual jobs doesn't seem like it would recommend as a guide to the future, but through their dedication and engagement, we can see a viable world.

These portraits of men in somewhat unusual jobs doesn't seem like it would recommend as a guide to the future, but through their dedication and engagement, we can see a viable world."

It starts off as one thing and then becomes another by cheating with the plot in a obvious attempt to pull the wool over our eyes. At the beginning, and for a short but involving while, Malice looks like a psycho killer film. then it turns into a rather generic film noir, with all the stereotypes: the high heels, the black mail, the bad girl, and a spectacular fall from a high place in slow motion. The plot gets progressively hard to believe and Nicole Kidman is given more than her acting ability can handle, which becomes a burden on the movie

During the earlier portion of the movie (the better portion) Malice demonstrates on two or even three occasions that Director Harold Becker is more than capable of making his product not just a thriller but a scary movie, the kind that makes the audience jump, but suspense seems to be of little interest in the end.

Malice entertains only on a superficial level. At times it can draw you towards the edge of your seat, but more often it has you sitting back, tired from watching genre clich√©s play out. What starts off good slowly degrades into a b-movie, a one in a million enterprise which may prove useful only if it is the only movie on the box late at night. It is certainly not unwatchable, it just not all that good."

Ed Burns was the Irish Catholic Woody Allen of the 90s, and while he still makes movies, he's not in his heyday anymore. She's The One was his best film, in my opinion, and if you rent it, you'll get to see the young, promising actresses Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Aniston, as well as Frasier's dad without his cane! (I told you this was a 90s flick) An Irish Catholic family with a gruff father, a particularly religious mother, and two competitive sons is thrown for a loop when both sons fall in love with the same woman. She's the one! The plot moves fast and has lots of twists along the way, and the 90s banter is priceless.

I have a soft spot in my heart for this film, but I will admit it's a tad dated, so it would be best to put on your 90s goggles when watching it."
1049,House Arrest (1996),02-Aug-1996,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Comedy']," I loved House Arrest as a kid. The idea of a bunch of kids being able to lock their parents in the basement and party till they die is one thing that crosses a kid's mind every now and then.

Kyle Howard and Amy Sakasitz are Grover and Stacey Beindorf, two kids who have just been told by their parents (Jamie Lee Curtis and Kevin Pollak) that they're getting a divorce. Like most kids, the Grover and Stacey don't want their parents to separate, and can't understand why they can't just try to work things out. So, they come up with a new kind of anarchist therapy--they decide to lock their parents in the basement and force them to work out their problems.

A plan like that is pretty incredible, especially when some of Grover's friends get wind of it and decide to add their parents to the mix. And they don't get along too well. Grover's bully-turned-buddy, TJ Krupp, doesn't get along well with his father (Christopher McDonald) a loud mouth obnoxious attorney who cheats on his timid wife. Mr. Krupp consistently berates those around him, even while the parents are in their brief moments of enjoying themselves in the basement. Brooke's (Jennifer Love Hewitt) trying to reform her mom (Jennifer Tilly) so that she won't keep acting like a teenager. And Matt (Mooky Arizona) is using preventative therapy because his dad (Wallace Shawn), who has been divorced twice before on the second anniversary of each marriage, is coming up on his second year again. And, Beindorf's parents just can't seem to talk out their problems without getting into a fight.

While the parents are stuck downstairs in a cleverly assembled cage (sort of), the kids take advantage of their independence. A house party, a dinner party, etc, until Grover sees that things are getting out of control and their losing sight of their objective--to get the parents to fix their problems. They eventually wise up, and behave like adults, in a well-meaning, but wholly naive way to get the parents to sort things out.

The funniest moments arise when Roy Walston shows up as the former police chief and nosey next door neighbor. He suspects something's up at the Beindorf house, and the kids find themselves going to great lengths after a while trying to keep their therapy plans a secret. Russell Harper as the wild and crazy TJ is also a load of laughs, because once the bully, the other kids aren't sure how to behave around one another. Also, too, the kids start to confront their own problems with each other, which are normal problems that arise in the High School caste system. Grover, for example, likes Brooke but never admits to her how he feels. TJ accuses Brooke of being an obnoxious princess who never paid much attention to anyone considered below her status as the ""Ice Queen."" And so forth. And finally, whenever Christopher MacDonald blows his top as the irritable Mr. Krupp, you get some pretty funny sequences. There's just so much of Mr. Krupp one can take without acting out violently (but kid-safe violence...after all, it's a family movie).

It's a pretty good movie for kids. They'll likely enjoy the cast, though older ones could be old enough to appreciate the family problems that arise."
1050,"Ghost and Mrs. Muir, The (1947)",01-Jan-1947,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"['Drama', 'Romance']"," I first saw this movie when I was very young - maybe 9 or so - when my mother rented it. I remember watching it over and over again. When I saw that the DVD had come out I didn't even hesitate; I bought it right away. I'm glad I did.

There are many themes that find their way into this movie: feminism, romance, the supernatural, etc. The one that struck me the most was a longing for something that could never be while maintaining the practical to survive. There is a constant tension between Gene Tierney (Mrs. Muir) and Rex Harrison (Captain Gregg) that is never really satisfied. Words of love are never spoken, not even in the passionate monologue from Rex Harrison. But they are unnecessary because the undercurrents are so strong. Through this tension they work and live normally because what else is there to do? Because of this there is a layer of sad acceptance in the actions of Mrs. Muir and Captain Gregg, which is understandable to all of the audience - this is an emotion that all people are forced to feel at one point or another.

From a technical standpoint, the film is obviously in black and white which does nothing to detract from the story. The cinematography was nominated for an Oscar, and should have won in my opinion. I also am one of many that want to rebuild the house and live there forever. The passage of time should definitely be noted, as it was masterfully portrayed.

On the whole, it is a wonderful movie which I would recommend to anyone."

1053,Now and Then (1995),01-Jan-1995,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," I see a lot of people comparing this movie to Stand By Me but the problem with that is if you were old enough to see Stand By Me when it was first released then hate to break it to you but this movie is not targeted at your demographic. Just because something feels like a remake of a movie made a decade before does not mean that the new movie is in anyway terrible. Take Heathers and Mean Girls for example both good movies but in my opinion Mean Girls appealed to me more as it was aimed at my demographic. If you can't judge a movie on it's own merits than perhaps you need to chill a little.

Anyway, Now and Then is one of those movies that sticks with you for life. Recently I just converted a friend of mine in her mid twenties to loving this movie. I was dumbfounded that she had missed this right of passage that most young girls had when this movie was released. Every girl can relate to one of the four characters and it reminds you of a simpler time where all that mattered were boys, having fun and navigating your way through growing up. I still remember taking Cosmo quizzes and thinking they had an insight into your soul, preparing for your first kiss and investing in my first bra. I know there are a lot of parents who think this movie is overly sexualised but guess what when your kid is going through puberty nothing will turn them back into your precious little angel. Accept it and hope they have supportive friends who they can share their journey with.

If you watch the movie with an open heart you will find a great cast that feels real in their characters, a brilliant soundtrack that increases your nostalgia level and a deep and meaningful storyline. It deals with subject matter that many adolescent movies steer clear of, just because you are young does not mean you haven't experienced hurt and pain like an adult. Adolescents needs to know that life is not always perfect and that there will be ups and downs but everyone is all in it together. I cannot strongly recommend this movie enough if you are willing to enjoy this movie for what it is, a fantastic coming of age movie."

Talent such as herself, Bill Pullman, Joan Cusack, Dean Stockwell, Ellen Cleghorne, and the sensational Joan Plowright is wasted in this turkey.

I must admit however that it did start off promising - the typical single woman living in the shadow of recently married sister, meets nice guy, blah blah blah.. but went totally downhill soon afterwards. What caused Whitman (Pullman) to be such a hyperactive fool? And Joan Cusack and her feeb slave Bob? I love Joan, she's had some great roles (hence the 2 oscar noms) but not even her charismatic prowess can save this hairball. She has to deal with a brainless character who cuts couches and puts gum in Ellen's hair! Sheesh - and the Mexican kids?? Well, I laughed at that scene.. I found it to be quite racist also mind you.

Unfunny, unoriginal and uninspired right up to the end wedding where Ellen is in rollerblades or something and Joan is sporting a rifle. Spare me the hyperbole and give me my ninety minutes back.

I picked up this movie with the intent of watching it with my kids, aged 12 and 6. About 15 minutes or so into the movie, after witnessing shot-drinking, a heroin needle and two people sharing a joint, I seriously considered turning the movie off. The fact is that once past these moments, the movie does begin to work as a more heart-warming family tale. What irks me however is that I don't understand why people making a movie that kids can watch have to resort to adult imagery in some feeble attempt to generate adult interest. If one wishes to make a grown-up movie with adult images, then by all means do so, but this movie simply does not work on that level; it maintains too much of a superficial and sweet flavor to be considered as such. So, why then, if I am watching a family movie, should I be forced to lie to my children about some of the imagery they are seeing? I certainly don't want to explain to them what heroin or marijuana is and the truth is that none of these images were necessary to the telling of the story.

Therein lies my biggest problem with this movie as a whole. There are simply too many small scenes and images that are forcibly interjected into the story without necessity. The baseball scene, the scene by the edge of the quarry as well as many other smaller moments almost seem randomly inserted into the movie as though after the final cut the producers felt they need 20 minutes more to fill.

My kids, fortunately, asked no questions, but did ask to watch the movie again the next day (a practice they inherited from their father), so I would honestly say that the movie does function on their level and I would recommend it to any parent who doesn't feel uncomfortable by the occasional adult imagery passing before their child's eyes."
1056,Cronos (1992),01-Jan-1992,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Horror']," A new vision of the vampire myth involving an insect trapped in a device that grants immortality, an innocent grandfather, his all but silent granddaughter, a human monster and his victimized nephew.

An elderly antiques shop owner, Jesus Gris, and his granddaughter, Aurora, discover an unusually device in a four hundred year old Archangel statue. Gris inadvertently triggers the device which begins a change in him that not only slowly makes him more youthful in look and energy but infects him with an addict's consuming fixation for blood. Unfortunately for Gris, he is not the only one with knowledge of the device's existence and power, and he becomes the target of the dying businessman De La Guardia's desire for immortality at any cost and his violent nephew Angel.

Loved this film! Loved it! I've always had a thing for vampires and I really enjoyed this new view of the vampire mythology. This isn't just a new story of vampirism though, it is also a tale of family. The love, devotion, and acceptance of family is beautifully shown through the grandfather Jesus and granddaughter Aurora, as is the dark side of family, with it's violence, abuse and victimization, as shown through the obsessed De La Guardia and his nephew Angel.

Frederico Luppi is excellent as Gris. He brings a depth and ""every-man"" dignity to Jesus not often seen. A subtle, detailed performance.

Claudio Brooks is terrifying as the obsessed De La Guardia. A ""Dorian Gray"" portrait of a monster whose humanity lays in a tank with his diseased organs.

Ron Perlman is absolutely superb as Angel. He takes what could have been the average brute/thug character and gives him humor, depth, and the ability to evoke sympathy and, almost, forgiveness, from the audience.

Favorite line (narration describing the death of the Cronos device creator): ""His skin was the color of marble in moonlight.""

Definitely worth buying."
1057,"Pallbearer, The (1996)",19-Apr-1996,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Comedy']," The DVD cover to this film describes it as ""wildly entertaining."" I find this characterization ""wildly"" inappropriate. Although it does have its comedic moments at the beginning (the funeral scenes are reminiscent of ""The Big Chill"" and the ""Chuckles the Clown"" episode of ""Mary Tyler Moore, the film smoothly evolves into a poignant story of Tom Thompson's(Schwimmer)search for the meaning of his life. He is hindered in part by his inability to get past an unrequited love in high school (played by Paltrow). Schwimmers's body language is so in tune to the emptiness of his character. His journey reminds me, once again of another film - Benjamin Braddock in ""The Graduate. Tom has three friends who give the appearance of having figured things out, but demonstrate their own frailties before the film is done. Barbara Hershey, in the role of the mother of the deceased, initially earns no sympathy, but by end of the film, there is more understanding, of if not empathy her character. (By the way, I mean no criticism in comparing this film or its characters to other film.)

Don't see this film if you're looking for a light-hearted comedy. It's not ""Friends"" or ""Shallow Hall."" It's a thoughtful film with an especially sweet performance by David Schwimmer."

Tonight's movie review is the drama The War (1994) where a young Lidia recalls an eventful summer, recounting that time when her twin brother Stu, who is played by someone someone before he was Frodo Baggins, Elijah Wood finds himself learning hard truths about life from his father played by the likeable Kevin Costner. Costner plays Stephen, a tortured soul trying to teach his young son the value of lessons he had learned during the war including positive lessons on social consciousness, but struggles to be a breadwinner for his family due to post-traumatic stress disorder from his service in the Vietnam War. The title not only refers to the Vietnam War, which although relevant to the story, it has a very limited place in the film, has more of a purpose referring to the literal war that the children continuously wage with one another over a treehouse. The war which each kid goes through is figurative in the sense that trying to battle the inner rage within each of them due to battling for identity and purpose.

The film is strong in narrative of the father and son relationship however I found it weird that the film was being narrated by Lidia, as the character herself did not have that much presence and content to be the focal point of the movie. It would have been nice to see this narrative from the brother or both kids to show the duality of each character. The film does well with reflecting on social issues found in this era, including social inequality, the root causes of war and the aftermath of it. To me the kids do well in this film by displaying learning harsh lessons of life and it was smart by the filmmaker to stray away from Costner, even though his character does have a strong influence to the overall story however the performance of the kids demonstrates and correlate with the previous wars experienced by their elders including battling and facing internal and external demons and bullies. The great scene in the movie is the final talk between father and son, where Costner goes to a different level of how a parent should be vulnerable with their child and teach them of the flaws and gaps in life however to understand how life is filled with miracles and these gaps can be filled in by one person's decision. A great example of this would be the 'cotton candy' scene. The only other noticeable supporting character is another kid actor LaToya Chisholm who plays Elvadine and her monologue of how she is struggling both at a domestic and social level is amazing - awesome job. Also a great nod to late 60s and early 70s tunes. An underrated flick with a strong story around the kids with great support by Costner, overall 7/10."
1059,Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood (1996),01-Jan-1996,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Comedy']," ""Menace"" is not funny. It tries hard - too hard. but rarely brings a smile. There is no acting, just mugging. One of the main characters wears a stupid grimace on his face the entire movie. No doubt as the less talented Wayans brothers starred, wrote and produced the film they were entirely blind to their lack of talent.

Menace consists of a series of unfunny, one joke skits. The punchline can be seen a mile off, but you have to wait until it all unfolds. No zippy one-liners or snappy dialogue here. Just one scene after another building up to the joke. The jokes themselves are juvenile. Loc Dog (the one with the perma-grimace) talks to a beautiful woman - but then she has ... bad breath and then she picks her nose and then, wait for it (remember you must always w-a-i-t) she farts! How funny is that? Ten-year old boys may find it funny as they won't have heard the jokes as many times before. Alternatively, if you like watching movies completely drunk or stoned then you will be able to follow along and may even find it amusing. The challenge will be getting drunk enough to reduce your mental state to the level of the movie without passing out."

Because it totally destroys the real Pinocchio's image. Pinocchio isn't a such kid-friendly story in his original BOOK (yes, it is a book, not a fairy tale) written by Carlo Collodi. It was a story for everyone yes, but it was also pretty dark and edgy too!

That's why I absolutely love this movie (and hate to the death that awful sequel). I know, like the Disney one, it doesn't follow perfectly the plot of the book, but the big difference is that it actually have MORE things from the book than the Disney one. Also, the book has a pretty long story with lots of things that are difficult to put in a hour and half movie (Roberto Begnigni tried to do that, and we all know that the result was horrible). The classic special effects without CGI are amazing and the acting is great. The style of the movie reminds me a little Terry Gilliam's ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"" (1988). This movie is really magic to me and it has all the atmosphere and style of the original book. If only people read more Collodi's book (wich is amazing) and watch less the Disney movie, everybody would agree with me.

This is by far my favorite Pinocchio movie, and one of my favorite movies of all time."

Classic Aurora control scenes and blow-off lines. but it'a mess... The title could have been ""Terms of Endearment 2: Return to the Cash Cow.""

What could possibly be more unnecessary than a sequel to Terms of Endearment? Because the pivotal relationship was eliminated by Wingers exit in the first film, this sequel has no focus. What had been an amusing take on the funny and sad moments in an erratic mother-daughter relationship, has become a plot less holding pattern. There is no central emotional relationship to care about and the characters have little to do. They have not found a suitable foil for Aurora here. The relationship between Patsy and Aurora which had been quietly disagreeable, is now full-on antagonism. And that's a familiar, unsatisfying device to duct-tape a story onto.

If you were wondering what happens next after Terms ended, the answer is that the characters continued living. Whoopee. ""Star"" tries to milk tender emotions from you, but those feelings are given no foundation. It just moves on to some new unrelated emotional ""payload"" every ten minutes or so. Whether this went on for an hour or three (which it feels like) it just wears you down. The creators fail to understand that extraneous undeveloped characters (who've barely been introduced) can only deliver phony emotional epiphanies. It's so overwritten that superfluous sub-plots are M.I.A. for an hour at a time.

It has so many false endings, that I gave up shortly after Nicholsons odd, special-guest-star appearance. He arrives to spout some tender inexplicable pseudo-Oprah drivel. It's like it was written by Edna Ferber. It goes on and on and on..."

With protests violently broken up on the streets, armed struggle is seen as the only solution and leads to the formation of the 8th October group (MR8). Desiring direct action, Fernando and Cesar join the group and are trained in weaponry and the likes. However during a bank job, Cesar hesitates to kill and is shot and captured by the police, while the others flee. It is this that gives Fernando the idea to kidnap the American ambassador in return for the release of 15 captured revolutionaries and bringing the events to the attention of the world. This film tells the story of the four-day hostage situation in the mid-sixties.

I'm not a particularly well-read person and there is a lot of history (even recent history) that I am simply not aware of and this includes the events and times presented in this film. For that reason I cannot really comment on the accuracy or level of detail containing in this telling but what little I have since gleamed from other sources tell me that it is pretty fair and close enough to being accurate. The plot is well told and is made interesting by the attention paid to the people involved in the situation; the drama and tension comes from them rather than false action sequences or stand-offs. The thanks for this should lie with the cast but also with the script that creates the characters and makes them 'real', meaning we find it easier to understand them and feel for the positions they are in. The historical context is well done and I did find it very easy to get engaged in.

The characters are where it is at and they are all very 'human'. We are never made to totally root for them because of what they are doing, but we are helped to understand why they are doing this and how hard it is for some of them to actually turn their words into action. Cardoso does this best and he is the real heart of the film and easily the most sympathetic character. He has good chemistry with Arkin, who does well acting in a foreign film. Torres does well to gradually soften her character as the film goes and it makes her more interesting than she was early on. Support is all pretty good with no really weak performances anywhere but the film mostly belongs to these lead three. The direction is good, capturing the feel of the period early on (where stock footage blends seamlessly into the main film) and producing tension without overdoing the style over substance.

Overall this is a pretty good film, telling a straight story using the characters to drive it forward and involve the audience. The film has tension but it comes from the people involved and the situations they face in the attempts to do the 'right thing'. The script delivers the characters to the actors and the actors are convincing in their delivery, producing an engaging and interesting film that helps deliver historical relevance in a miniature story."

From the very first moment, when a tiny spec of colour blossoms from the dark screen to form a scene from one of Sara's stories, it is positively captivating.

As a film, it is an enduring work, worth more than the sum of its parts. Indeed, all aspects of the film work together seamlessly. The script is excellent and the cast is strong.

Liesel Matthews provides a sensitive and emotional performance as Sara Crewe, her wide eyes alternately filled to the brim with passion, or achingly desolate. Vanessa Lee Chester provides a strong performance as Becky, and Eleanor Brom's calm, calculated performance prevents Miss Minchin's character from becoming caricature.

Emmanual Luzbeki's cinematography is stunning and artistic. The soundtrack is charming, and the scenes are filmed artistically, with a level of openness and approachability that is much to be commended. A dream sequence in the middle of the film where Sara sees neighbour Ram Daas in the house next door and dances to the drifting snowflakes is a triumph in artistry. The banquet scene, with its sumptuous mise-en-scene, is made resplendent with the joy exuded by the talented young actresses.

As an adaptation, it is a powerful piece; though it strays from the novel, it is done so tastefully, in the style of the novel, and the climax is both heartbreaking and incredibly heart-warming.

A Little Princess is precisely the type of movie every child should watch- and every adult. It goes to the heart of what it means to be human; to suffer, to live graciously, to love, to take joy in the small things and to take comfort in each other. It is a magical experience, and completely satisfying to watch. After seeing this film, you would have to be heartless to forget it."
1064,Crossfire (1947),01-Jan-1947,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['Crime', 'Film-Noir']"," This is an expertly made, moodily photographed and naturally acted piece of of entertainment. On the screen the action is minimal but in your brain, it's explosive.

So many themes are dealt with such as racism, bullying, coercive manipulation but what it explores best is the trauma which millions of people were experiencing when this was made - how to cope with the shock of not being at war anymore. For five or three years, for millions of people, their one sole purpose of their lives, their reason for existence was to win the war and to kill the enemy. Every day of their lives was motivated by hatred of the enemy, that defined who they were then one day everyone is expected to become a completely different person. This picture deals with how this adjustment is so difficult. Being a crime thriller it does this I think better than BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES which was a little too sentimental for me.

From start to finish it's thoroughly engaging but one scene is particularly memorable. The only other film I can think of which gives you that terrifying sense of being so intoxicated that you don't know what's happening to you and don't care what's happening to you is TRAIN SPOTTING. Suffering from combat withdrawal, the character, Mitch drowns himself in booze, meets a working girl in a bar then has no idea what he's doing or where he ends up. His sense of reason has deserted him, like a good soldier, he just drifts along and does what he's told. This scene is exceptionally well made - you yourself experience his dissociation from reality.

The trouble for Mitch is that he's a prime suspect for a murder. This is the perfect start to a perfect film noir."

It takes on the daunting task of portraying the history of the world until modern times (or the early 80s, at least) entirely without dialogue. It is a documentary of sorts, in that it is amazingly informative, but it is filmed like a Hollywood film. Expertly framed shots and flawlessly smooth camera movement and shot composition. There is an unbelievable amount of talent behind this film, both in the fascinating images that are presented and the mesmerizing score by Philip Glass.

It is a very slow moving film, but it manages to keep your attention because, in many cases, it is just so interesting to see the things that are portrayed and the way that they are shown. This is the only film, for example, where you can see a shot of a 737 approaches directly toward the camera over a hot runway in a shot that is possibly over a minute long with no movement other than the sluggish lumbering of the massive plain.

Godfrey Reggio takes Glass's score and places images over it that add to the sound and create an experience that is far greater than, as they say, the sum of its parts. The shots contain camera movement or lack movement, are sped up or slowed down, and have live sound or no live sound depending on the desired effect, and the end result is absolutely hypnotic.

This is a wonderful cinematic experience for people of all ages, and possibly my favorite thing about this film and it's successors is that, because they have no dialogue, they can be shown in any country in the world and not have to worry about subtitles or even altered meanings. This is a film for humanity."

This is the touching story of an out casted half dog half wolf named Balto voiced by the talented Kevin Bacon who's voice added a slight charm to the Balto character. The story takes place in Nome Alaska in the year 1925. A sickness as stricken the town's children and with out the antitoxin which is located hundreds of miles away in town of Nanana, the children will surly die. The dog team sent to retrieve the medicine which is led by Balto's almost arch nemesis Steel, is lost in a horrible snow storm. Now it is up to Balto to find the missing sled dog team and bring the medicine back to Nome before it is too late.

This movie is so gripping, I can never sit through the whole thing without balling my eyes out. This movie has a great plot which is based of a true story, a wonderful cast of voice actors, and a vary flowing animation style. This movie is so gripping and compelling that it as inspired me to become an cartoonist. I loved this movie so much that some how I found out I have three copies of it in my movie library. Surly this movie is worth seeing or owning if it makes a 17 year old shows tears for it, or sets the course for his career. Call me a geek but this movie is perfect for any one who likes talking animals, old school basic animation, and happy endings."

This film certainly has excellent acting by Martin Donovan, Elina L√∂wensohn, and Isabelle Huppert. (Donovan is still working with Hartley, and has just appeared in Hartley's latest film NED RIFLE (2014).) But Hartley does not pull off the extremely unpleasant story about some pretty unpleasant people. He goes for comedic effects including holding shots for long enough for us to laugh (hopefully), but he overdoes it and the whole thing does not work. Nor would one necessarily want to know what happens to those people anyway. And I for one certainly did not want to laugh about it, because they are all so disgusting that it simply is not funny. The film starts off with Martin Donovan lying in an alley in New York City, apparently dead. Elina L√∂wensohn is scampering around his body anxiously and then runs off in fear. Donovan then wakes up and can remember nothing, not even who he is. So far, so good, a promising start to an amnesia story. But then Hartley has ludicrously created a character played by Huppert who is an ex-nun who has left her convent and engages in sex fantasies, claiming to Donovan (whom she befriends) that she is a nymphomaniac who is also a virgin. So far not so good. It is too silly, and Huppert's gloomy expressions and attempts to make her character convincing by means of enigmatic frowns are not successful. Then we discover that the unknown persona of Donovan is not Mr. Nice Guy suffering from memory loss, as we have been led to believe, but instead a Mr. Extremely Nasty who murders and maims people and is involved in prostitution rackets. Charming! So we have a violent nutter who is mixed up with a pious nutter and also with a pornography star who is also a nutter, played by the always-intriguing and alluring L√∂wensohn whose talents are utterly wasted here. And it is all such a waste of time. Hartley should have torn up the hopeless script and written something worthwhile, but instead he went ahead and shot the damned thing. If we are meant to see anything profound in the resulting mess, I have yet to detect it. Time to move on."

Lower Manhattan underground hipster, Mary (Posey) throws an illegal ""sip"" that gets her busted and tossed in jail. In search of employment the immature Mary goes whining to her godmother librarian for work who grudgingly takes her on. Determined to succeed she embarks on the road to redemption.

Posey plays it infantile cutesy most the way which gets tiresome fast.

1073,Shallow Grave (1994),01-Jan-1994,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,['Thriller']," Alex, David and Juliet share a flat together and are looking for a new flat mate to help fill the flat out. They see various applicants who don't fit until they meet the mysterious Hugo who is `interesting' and takes the room. Almost a week goes by and he doesn't come out of his room once, so they break down Hugo's door to find him dead with a suitcase full of money. To keep the money, they agree to destroy Hugo's body and draw straws to see who does the cutting. David ends up doing the deed but it affects him badly and he becomes increasingly erratic and paranoid. Meanwhile two criminals are dredging the underworld looking for the money.

Any film that can pose a moral question that stays with the audience is off to a good start and needs to build on it. That is the case here with the `would you keep the money' question - the answer being `yes' in terms of the characters here. The plot then sees the greed do what greed do best - feed paranoia and divisions between the characters. It's a theme that has been done before but is still well done here. The plot has weaknesses in logic and flow - David's paranoia doesn't totally go the way that seems most likely, rather the way that the film requires. Also the film doesn't build good characters. However what it does do well is turn up tension and drama very well - as the net closes and the characters start to turn on each other.

This is where the comparatively short running time helps - it keeps the whole thing from being onscreen too long to be analysed to death while you are watching it. I didn't question the weaknesses because I was caught up in the story. It has a good pace on it although it can't keep up the speed it set with it's stylish opening credits (which have been impersonated so often since). The final act is a fitting denouncement and, like I said, even if some of it doesn't totally scan the film moves along fast enough to cover it.

Despite the lack of really developed characters, the cast do really good jobs on the whole. McGregor is great - this and Trainspotting show how great it can be, just makes it harder to see him looking miserable in the Star Wars films. Fox is also very good, although she is a lot subtler than McGregor. However it is Eccleston who steals the film, even if he is required to go further than he should have in his downward spiral; contrast his character at the start and the end of the film, he did very well to gradually go from one to the other convincingly. The support cast is made up of familiar faces who don't really do that much - McCredie, Stott, Allen and Mullan.

Overall this is not without it's flaws but it works as a tight little moral thriller that is really enjoyable while watching it. And the ending will have you in the pub or on the message boards talking about it (in a good way)."

The movie has such a relatable premise, but I feel it could have been just a little better. But watching the movie provided me with the feeling that I am not alone in this ordeal. The movie was written pretty well and this is Ben Stiller's directorial debut, so a movie like this is not a bad way to begin a directing career.

Stiller's film is about a TV production assistant named Lelaina who is creating a documentary about post-grad life with her three friends: Troy who is a philosophical unemployed slacker, Vicki who is the manager of Gap, and Sammy who is trying to find his sexuality. When she meets Michael, an executive at an MTV-like studio, there is a chance her documentary can now go public.

The film is reasonably acted. Winona Ryder does a pretty good job as Lelaina, even if she seems a little whiny. I liked Ethan Hawke's character as his philosophy reminded of his character in the Before Sunrise series. Ben Stiller had a limited role, but he did a solid job. I also like Steve Zahn as the man trying to find out who he is.

Overall, Reality Bites is a decent movie because mainly it has a theme that people my age can relate to. The path to show this theme may not work as effective, but the movie was still mostly entertaining. I will say that the documentary shots got a little annoying at times, but the narrative itself is quite good.

I do not include a synopsis of the film/show -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it.

My scale: 1-5 decreasing degrees of ""terrible"", with 5 being ""mediocre"" 6- OK. Generally held my interest OR had reasonable cast and/or cinematography, might watch it again 7 - Good. My default rating for a movie I liked enough to watch again, but didn't rise to the upper echelons 8- Very good. Would watch again and recommend to others 9- Outstanding. Would watch over and over; top 10% of my ratings 10 - A classic. (Less than 2% receive this rating). For Lifetime Movies for Chicks (LMFC), drop the above scale by 3 notches. A 6 is excellent and 7 almost unattainable."

It seemed like a new film at the time, and I guess it was new to the VHS format when I saw it. I didn't know it was originally released in theatres years before then until I looked it up, which I believe was sometime in the past few years. I saw it at least once in the 1990's, when I was around ten years old, but after over a decade without seeing it, I've finally gotten around to doing so. By this time, I knew ""Oliver & Company"" wasn't one of Disney's most popular animated features, but as usual, I thought it was still a good one.

A litter of orphaned kittens are purchased on a street in New York City, but sadly, one of them, an orange cat named Oliver, is left behind. This kitten wanders the streets of the city and can't seem to find anyone to interact with until he meets a dog named Dodger. Oliver helps Dodger steal from a hot dog vendor, but the dog then refuses to share the food with him, so the homeless kitten follows the dog back to where he lives. Dodger's home is a barge, where he lives with several other dogs and their poor owner, Fagin. Fagin is in trouble, as he owes a loan shark named Sykes a lot of money, and only has three days to pay it! The next day, Oliver goes with Fagin and his dogs on a mission to try and somehow get enough money for the man to pay off his debt. While they are out on the streets, the kitten is found and adopted by a friendly little girl named Jenny Foxworth, but this may lead to more trouble.

This 27th Disney animated feature starts on the streets of New York, showing people buying the kittens. This is not a stunning beginning, but it does get rather moving as we see poor Oliver left behind in the rain. More major characters are introduced along the way, starting with Dodger, voiced by renowned musician Billy Joel. We soon hear him sing, ""Why Should I Worry"", a song I remember from my first viewing of the film. Of all the songs contained in ""Oliver & Company"", that one might stand out the most. After that, the film soon introduces the rest of the dogs that live on the barge and their owner, Fagin. These are generally likable characters, much like Oliver, and so is Jenny, who first appears a little later in the film. The voice acting is also very good, which helps. As one would expect from a Disney film, there's also humour here. Tito, a Chihuahua voiced by Cheech Marin, can be very funny, and he's certainly not the only one. The plot may not be the greatest ever written, but it's enough to hold one's interest. The animation is also pretty good here, with some nice city backgrounds.

Unlike many of the other animated Disney movies made during the 20th Century, this one is certainly not considered one of the classics, and that's understandable. There are definitely a number of better ones from the company. However, while ""Oliver & Company"" is nothing TOO special, it's still decent family fare, maybe more for kids, but it still has enough for adult Disney fans. I'm sure quite a few Disney buffs don't like this 1988 release at all, and there are some things which might make it a little different from most of the company's other animations, most notably the songs. These aren't typical Disney musical numbers, and I don't think most of them are among the most memorable, either, but they certainly could be worse. Anyway, while I wouldn't expect this to be one of the best animated movies you've ever seen, it still has my recommendation for those who like this type of film, regardless of age."

Tarantino saw the original short film while promoting his Reservior Dogs at an Italian film festival, and suggested the filmmakers to expand it to a feature film, and he would produce it. They did of course, and to me, this is a work of art, with a film score that fits about as perfect to the scenes as any I have seen. Angela Jones plays Gabriela, a Columbian beauty that has moved to Miami, and has an obsession with bloody crime scenes. She gets a job with a company that cleans up crime scenes, and she starts following the news accounts of a serial killer played by William Baldwin. After his recent murder, she gets assigned the job of cleaning up the bloody mess, and doesn't know it, but the killer is locked in the wine closet because he left a clue to his identity. Soon, there is the grand finale, which is a danse macabre between the two, with an ending that knocked me out of my chair when I first saw it.

Woman have it rough competing in male dominated society and men are responsible for all of woman neurosis seems to be the message. Ho Hum! Where have we heard that before?

Just about every character in this film is angry, nasty, neurotic, and unpleasant, except for teenage ""Tomgirl"" named Ed, who is just a little mixed up. The scenes of Eve's dreams and hidden memories are down right laughable, like the kind of stuff found in some over indulgent student film. The film has not coherent plot, just a lot of incidents. And would somebody please explain the ending?

There are some people who praise this film because it deals with characters searching for their identity, but most of the characters come across as so self absorbed that they evoke no sympathy. The film puts an emphasis on getting in touch with ones ""feelings."" But when one constantly dwells on his/her feelings, its leads to selfishness and hedonism, a point the films makers seem not to be aware of."

A gang of crooks. The perfect plan. It all goes wrong. They're in trouble. The police are outside. They're cornered. What are they gonna do now?

Sound familiar?

The movie seems like it's trying to be a combination of the acting workshop, the ""indie"" film and the theater.

It's the kind of things that actors love--it's kind of like a workshop or a play because it mostly consists of tight focusing on the actors acting... acting angry, tense, scared, conversing, scheming, planning--giving the performers a lot of free range to really ham it all up.

A trio of crooks, one leader, one goon, one brother, come up with a big heist scheme... and a monkey wrench is thrown into the works. To top things off, there's a bit of a ""fender-bender"" and one of the crooks in flung through the back of the windshield.

The cops are on their tail and they stumble into a bar named poetically (and leadenly) ""Dino's Last Chance.""

Spacey, as a director, tries to keep the focus on the actors' performances and delivery of dialouge. He pans over to a bright passion-red cigarette ad of a smoking and smoldering Bogart. And he keeps all the violence off-screen, really.

I think that was a mistake. Focusing on the intensity and gruesome violent scenes would have given the movie some edge.

The problem with the movie is that it moves too slow and suffers from miscasting in almost every role. Matt Dillon (""Drugstore Cowboy"" and ""Wild Things"") seems too young and too idealistic to be the leader of this gang.

Gary Sinese seems to brooding and deep in thought to be a spineless tag-along with these guys and Joe Mantaga is effective as the traditional routine foul-swearing mad-dog police lieutenant who's all thumbs, but he isn't given anything to really do here.

William Fischter is the only actor who is believable in his role as a brainless grunt who just wants to spill blood.

And the crooks are in a tense situation where they either go to jail or they try to think of some way out of this.

Spacey lacks the ability to create a lot of tension and keep it going. The characters are mostly chatting away, trying to think of a plan... and they're to calm and too articulate. There's even a scene where the crooks are playing pool with a whole swarm of armed cops right outside, ready to strike. At one point, one of the crooks even call the police who are right outside the bar. Oh brother. Oh bother.

These cops are going to either blow them away or going to lock them up. Shouldn't the holed-up crooks be a little scared, a little uneasy? Meanwhile, all the real action is happening inside.

Someone whips out a gun, a baseball bat, which leads to an ugly confrontation off-screen and there's one more casualty that happens that's... well, kinda sad. But...

Faye Dunaway also should have spent more time with a dialect coach, improving on her New Orleans accent. Skeet Ullrich is fine in a smaller part.

A cop listening in reaches for a pack of matches at the absolute worst time is a nice look. And so is a scene where someone goes right through the rear windshield.

The dialouge is obviously trying to go for a David Mamet approach and it's as profane, but never as realistic or as insightful. I'm guessing Christian Forte is a fan Mamet fan.

The movie feels like too much of what it really is... a really low-budget movie with an actor behind the camera for the first time directing other actors from a script that's ""not bad, but needs a few more re-writes."" Spacey shows he's not a terrible director, but he lacks a sort of feel for ""shaping a movie"" and it feels like he's just filming actors act.

These actors are all talented and could work with the material, but they all feel out of place. As I said before, the movie really suffers from miscasting.

I don't mean that the wrong actors were cast. I think they found just the right cast, but placed them in all the wrong roles. I think switching some of the roles would've helped immensely.

Having veteran mob actor Joe Mantagna play the leader of the pack, Gary Sinese as the angry police lieutenant outside on his bullhorn giving orders and barking at his troops, keeping Fischter in his ""bloodthirsty goon"" part and Matt Dillion as the sacrificial lamb. That would have been a big improvement.

When some actors direct, it works. They can even win Oscars for it. But a lot of the time, when actors direct, they have a tendency to just focus on the performances. Just shoot the actors acting.

Sometimes it works... but they need a good showcase for it. An excuse for it.

Hostage situations are all pretty much the same in real life just like coming-of-age stories so it's only natural that movies about them will go from point A to point B as well.

There are a few really great entries into this genre.' Spacey himself appeared in a similar movie about hostage situations: ""The Negotiator.""

This certainly won't become a cult classic, let alone one of AFI's 100. Still, it does have a few nice moments and personal touches, but in the end, it's instantly forgettable and the kind of movie that would play best on regular TV. It's just not worth going out of your way to see.

I give a 3 out of 10.

Spacey's other directorial credit, ""Beyond The Sea"" was reportedly a better effort. Hmmm... maybe it's true. You need to fail before you succeed.

*** (out of 4)

With over 25-million copies of her book sold, Anne Frank is without question the most famous name of the victim's to Adolf Hitler's reign of terror during WWII. The teenager would keep a journal of her and her family's years of living in terror as they hid never knowing if someone would learn about their whereabouts or perhaps someone would tell on them. Then, of course, there was the drama of being so close with one another in such a short space, which just added to the drama as the outside world was falling apart. I think this is far from the perfect documentary for a number of reasons including a pacing issue, which I felt really made the film drag at spots. I'd also say that the documentary loses focus throughout and there are times where items other than Anne are being covered and they're just not nearly as interesting. With that said, the film is still very much worth seeing but in large part due to Miep Gies who was the main person who kept the family hidden and didn't give away their secret. It's pretty amazing getting to hear from someone so close to the events and not to mention that she not only helped the family but she was the one who discovered the diary. Hearing her tells her stories are without question the highlights of the film and this includes some pretty emotional stuff as she tells about the family being taken away from their location and of course the father having to learn that he was the only one who survived the Holocaust. I think the film probably would have been much better had it focused on her because there's no question that things aren't as sharp when she's not on the screen. The film is certainly worth seeing just for her but those interested in Anne Frank would probably be better served by either reading the actual book or watching the 1959 movie."

Granted, the message is about death and dignity, but it miseducates the viewers in the process. Not everyone dies of PML (I've had it since late 1996), and the people who do certainly aren't capable of having parties if they're within 2 weeks of losing it. This film was a huge obstacle for me when I told people of my illness. Some had seen it, and immediately applied the ""knowledge"" they'd gained as the context for the disease. This simply was not accurate information, for the most part.

Aside from the portrayals of ""fact"", I found the acting to be forced, the dialogue melodramatic (at times just plain silly), and the flow of the story to be caught up with too many details and superficial characters who didn't really belong. The only notable performance was Bronson Pinchot, who stole every scene he was in, to the point where he sometimes carried the film on his own.

This film was annoying, overly long, poorly cast and badly acted. No character seemed real, and I couldn't identify with any of them except Pinchot's. The whole affair seemed more reminiscent of the cheesy soap opera Ryan's Hope than a party of friends. If you want a tear-jerking ensemble movie, watch Longtime Companion or Relax It's Just Sex instead."

Van Damme and his sweaty abs look like they think they're in a 80's softcore parody of Enter The Dragon with 'acting' to match. The movie itself pulls a Confessions of a dangerous mind (2002), in that it purports to be a ""true"" story based on one man's unverified claim - the real Frank Dux is a known liar/exaggerator, with a lot of the stories he told the screenwriter later being shown as such. With this story, Dux got a buddy of his to corroborate it. Later after they had a falling out, the friend said Dux coached him to say it. And yet the male bimbos who defend this still buy into a story with nothing to back it up. I guess that's why they call it a cult movie. You spend 20 minutes watching live-action Action Figures (Van Damme even looks like he's made of plastic) kung-fu fight (choreography that's been done better in almost any other kung-fu movie you can think of) and 70 minutes wasted on a purile hyper-cliche cardboard excuse for a plot (""I must avenge so-and-so by competing in this sport/tournament for some reason!"") just to frame those 20 minutes where things actually happen. It's like seeing the Karate Kid as a grown man who went on to star in yet another brain cell killing Mortal Kombat movie. And it's all smathered with an extra coating of '80's cheese."
1088,Double Team (1997),04-Apr-1997,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Action']," I grew up with the movies of Jean Claude Van Damme, and I must say that not every movie he has been involved in has been all that great. And ""Double Team"" certainly was a swing and a miss.

So what doesn't work here? Well the storyline for starters. It wasn't really all that interesting. Sure it was semi-entertaining for what it was; a mediocre action movie. And the misplaced attempts at humor didn't really work in favor of the movie.

Jean Claude Van Damme delivers his usual action and martial arts, but the script didn't give him much to Work with. But the abysmal choice of Dennis Rodman to star alongside Van Damme was just wrong on so many levels. Dennis Rodman is devoid of anything that even remotely resembles acting talent. And the constant change of his hair color was just downright annoying.

The action sequences are well-choreographed and equally so executed on the screen, but it is hardly enough to salvage this train-wreck of a movie.

There are other far better Van Damme movies out there."

The lifeboat rescue scene. It seems like it takes half an hour to conclude this ""action"" scene. It was long enough for me to notice part of the problem. The soundtrack! Music is supposed to set the mood and blend into the film invisibly. The music chosen for this sequence, I suspect, should have been selected to incite pulse pounding nail-biting excitement. Instead, we are treated to a sad, tragedy-laden violin concerto appopriate akin to a funeral dirge. The non-sequitor was surrealistically hilarious.

The beaching of the liner. The ocean liner grounds itself not 100 feet out to sea when the bottom of the boat wedges into the sand but OVER the beach and after it tears up the boardwalk taking out a few flimsy oceanfront hotels that would have been carried away a la Wizard of Oz by any respectable hurricane. The writers appear to have neglected that ocean liners don't skim on the surface of water like jet-skis. Even supposing it did, liners are triangular and would fall over if placed on a beach. Ya kinna defy the laws of physics, cap'n!

Dreadful failed attempt at suspense. When big boats go bad they do it slowly. Yes it takes miles for a ship at full throttle to come to a stop, but the moment of tension occurs a good fifteen minutes before impact. After that, it's a matter of waiting for the inevitable. It's a matter of forlorn mourning, not edge-of-your-seat terror. Titanic captured this well. Speed 2 desperately tries to make a 30 mph crash have the same feel as a NASCAR crack-up. It just can't be done.

To round out the rationale... The acting is wooden, our beloved steely bus driver of Speed has been replaced by a piece of arm candy that Jack would've thrown out the window. Jack supplanted by a generic cleft-chin Dudley Doright named ""Alex"". The rest is recycled badly. A park bench with the Budweiser labels poking out from inside."
1090,Sliver (1993),01-Jan-1993,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,['Thriller']," I don't why many people put this movie down so bad. Anything with Sharon Stone is good. This movie is just as kinky as ""Basic Instinct"", only more high tech. Working for a publishing company is a hard job to take, even if you went through a rough marriage and trying to start over, finding yourself shouldn't be so hard. Not with Carly Norris(Sharon Stone). She moves into a new high in New York called Sliver Heights, she gets a room which the deceased lived. and their she meets the owner Zeke Hawkins(William Baldwin) owns Sliver Heights, and he thinks he God. This man is not only the owner, he's the biggest voyeur of that complex. A voyeur(Peeping Tom) like him make others look like amateurs. I liked ever scene of this movie, the love scenes, the shower scenes, the conversation scenes, and he actually records them which I think is downright obscene. Sharon never looked any hotter in that movie, and he character is really hard core all the way. The author Jack Landford(Tom Berenger) seemed to be a decent character, however his shady past makes him the target for police. When he was killed, the murders stopped, but the voyeurism was way more sinister than the crimes earlier. So Zeke was given a major attitude adjustment there, and I think it's time for a new owner. This movie was really hardcore, imagine for what the unrated version would be like! Rating 3 out of 5 stars."
1091,Pete's Dragon (1977),01-Jan-1977,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['Adventure', 'Animation', ""Children's"", 'Musical']"," I remember at one point in my childhood, I heard about a movie called ""Pete's Dragon"", maybe when it was about to come on TV, and also remember seeing some of it, though I can't remember how much I saw. There was another part of the film I remember seeing some years later (the part where the Dr. Terminus character manages to win over the initially angry people), but I didn't know what movie I was seeing. After many years, I could still remember the title of this mostly live action Disney film (but one with a cartoon dragon), and finally decided to watch it from start to finish this week. It's far from one of the most highly regarded Disney productions in the long history of the company, and I wasn't expecting it to be among the great ones, but I was expecting it to be better than I found it to be, which is not good at all for the most part.

With the help of his magical dragon, Elliott, a young orphaned boy named Pete manages to escape from his cruel adoptive family, the Gogans, but they are still determined to find him somehow or other. The boy and his dragon friend travel together and soon come to a village called Passamaquoddy. Before they enter, Pete tells Elliott that he must make himself invisible (a magical power of his) in order to avoid scaring the people, so the dragon reluctantly does so, but even in his invisible form, he soon causes a lot of trouble in the village, and since nobody can see him, it looks like Pete is responsible! After Pete gets away from an angry mob and Elliott scares Lampie, the drunken lighthouse keeper, the two of them go to a cave near the lighthouse, where Nora, Lampie's daughter, finds Pete and decides to give him shelter in her home. He often talks to her about Elliott, and she doesn't believe that this dragon actually exists, but plays along. Unfortunately, the dragon continues to cause trouble for Pete, and the village of Passamaquoddy has another problem when medicine showman Dr. Terminus and his assistant, Hoagy, are back to swindle the villagers again with their fraudulent formulas!

This live action/animation crossover is a musical, and unfortunately, the songs generally don't have much effect. I think this already shows with the first song, sung by the Gogans as they pursue Pete, but it gets worse after the boy and his dragon friend get away from them and we hear the next musical number, ""Boo Bop Bopbop Bop (I Love You, Too)"". During this song, I felt like I was watching something strictly for the very young. Basically, the rest of the songs also fail, including the ""I Saw a Dragon"" one featured in the part where Lampie tells the people in the tavern what he saw, a notably clumsy segment of the film. The musical numbers are only one of the significant flaws in the film. Most of the cast performances failed to impress me, especially Jane Kean overacting in the role of Miss Taylor, the strict teacher of the village. It doesn't seem that Sean Marshall, who plays the title character, was a very good child actor. ""Pete's Dragon"" does have some pretty funny parts, but not enough to make it really work as a comedy, either. Also, while I certainly didn't find myself not caring what happened to any of the characters, I still didn't find most of the story too entertaining for some reason, but that might have been largely because of the other problems.

This is a mainly live action family musical, and maybe I'm not usually into movies like this, but that hasn't stopped me from finding ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"", a live action family musical from six years before this one, to be a great film, so it's definitely not like ""Pete's Dragon"" would look bad to me regardless of quality. This particular Disney piece came out the same year as ""The Rescuers"", an all animated feature which disappointed me when I first saw it last year (I actually found its 1990 sequel, ""The Rescuers Down Under"", to be much better, as rare as that is with sequels and as much as many Disney fans would probably disagree), but even that film I found to be better than this very lacklustre live action/animation crossover. I gave ""Pete's Dragon"" a try, and realize that it has a following (not a huge one, but it is a following), but simply put, I just didn't like it. I guess I can still recommend it for kids and won't say adults should avoid it at all costs, but I also still think there are good reasons for all the criticism."
1092,Dear God (1996),01-Nov-1996,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Comedy']," A film like this is only on at one time of the year. Although it's about letters to God rather than Santa Claus, its theme of dreams coming true and its vague sentimentality are just right for the holiday season. The film is about a bunch of misfits and loners discovering a social conscience when they work in a department of the postal service that handles letters addressed to God and other people who don't have regular mailing addresses.

This is certainly no ask-god version of Nathanael West's Miss Lonelyhearts (filmed as Advice to the Lovelorn and Miss Lonelyhearts), where a character faced with innumerable demands from desperate members of the public is slowly driven mad. It seems there are few problems in this film that cannot be solved with a misappropriated saxophone (indeed, with all the gifts being doled out, the film's idea of God is little different to Father Christmas). Wider issues of poverty, illness, death and other injustices are ignored.

As an atheist, I was a little disappointed to see people talking about God inspiring the characters, as though nobody could do a good deed without being an agent of the Lord. It seems odd that a film with a potentially blasphemous premise (people impersonating God) could end up as such an affirmation of religion, but in the cinema people who impersonate priests and nuns tend to end up as heroes (We're No Angels, etc) while actual priests turn out to be villains. This film certainly panders to the audience's need for a feel-good spirituality that is simple and undemanding, without any of the complexities of organised religion.

To be fair, the crew and cast are competent and while it's not Garry Marshall's best film, it's not his most shamelessly manipulative either (Pretty Woman is far stupider). The characters are an appealingly motley bunch that could work well in a sitcom, some of the dialogue is funny, and Dear God is in many ways a decent piece of schmaltz. If you forget about it as soon as it's finished, it's probably fine."

The plot: a recently widowed man fusses at God due to his recent string of bad luck, ie death of his wife, tornado coming from no where and destroying, only his home, leaving his neighbors untouched, and so on. He then decides to break all the commandments as a way to challenge God to sort of a duel?

The photography was dark and dreary, even on sunny day scenes, giving the film a ""life is so drab"" undertone. We watch as the main character one by one breaks all of the commandments, which include a tastefully executed love scene with his brothers wife, played by Courteney Cox. As always, Ms.Cox's work was most admirable.

I can tell you first hand what being widowed is like, the pain and frustration are overwhelming. Commandments does not hit any of those marks. It is rather a self indulgent film that through black humor, tries to have us take a look at our own belief's. I won't even mention the ending.I will leave that for you to discover.

By LARRY McSHANE, Associated Press Writer

NEW YORK - This was no stage production, and there was no happy ending.

David Hampton, the ersatz son of Sidney Poitier whose pursuit of the glamorous life inspired the award-winning play ""Six Degrees of Separation,"" died last month in a decidedly desolate fashion: alone in a Manhattan hospital bed, friends confirmed Saturday.

""David, like many of us, had a real need to be somebody important and special,"" said attorney and close friend Susan Tipograph. ""He did stuff to be somebody in his mind ? somebody important, somebody fabulous.

""To me, he was fabulous.""

The black teenager earned notoriety by charming his way into New York's white upper crust, presenting himself in 1983 as the Oscar-winning Poitier's son and a Harvard University student. The scam inspired John Guare's acclaimed play and a movie starring Will Smith.

The reality was quite different: Hampton came from a middle-class home in Buffalo, a city he once dismissed as lacking anyone ""glamorous or fabulous or outrageously talented."" His father was an attorney, not an actor.

Hampton, 39, died at Beth Israel Hospital, Tipograph said. He had been living in a small room at an AIDS residence, and was trying to start work on a book about his life.

Hampton was glib, charming, funny ? the skills of the consummate con man. He talked his way into the homes of several prominent New Yorkers, including the dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism and the president of public television station WNET.

Once there, he reveled in the posh surroundings and fancy meals. He accepted money and clothes and regaled his hosts with stories about his famous ""father.""

""David took a great joy in living the life he lived,"" said attorney Ronald Kuby, who knew Hampton for more than a decade. ""It was performance art on the world's smallest possible stage, usually involving an audience of only one or two.""

After he was taken into custody in October 1983, police said Hampton had six previous arrests in New York and Buffalo. Hampton, just 19, pleaded guilty to attempted burglary and was sentenced to 21 months in prison.

Guare, inspired by the bizarre tale, opened his play in 1990 to immediate critical praise. It won the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award, an Obie, and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize.

But on the day the play was nominated for four Tony Awards, a court order was issued telling Hampton to stay away from Guare, who said he'd been threatened.

Hampton felt entitled to a cut of the cash generated by his ""work,"" and he sued ? unsuccessfully ? for a $100 million piece of the play's profits in 1992. There was victory in the defeat: It introduced him to another of Manhattan's bright lights, radical lawyer William Kunstler.

Hampton was later arrested for leaving this message on Guare's answering machine: ""I would strongly advise you that you give me some money or you can start counting your days."" A jury acquitted him of harassment.

""I think he felt used by Mr. Guare,"" said Tipograph. ""I'll let history judge that.""

The 1993 movie version of the play earned Stockard Channing an Oscar nomination for best actress. Channing recreated her stage performance as a wealthy Manhattanite taken in by the scam artist.

In recent years, Hampton kept in touch with friends and stayed in trouble: He faced charges of fare-beating and credit-card theft. One alleged victim told The New York Times that Hampton, using the name David Hampton-Montilio, duped him out of more than $1,400 in October 2001.

""When pretending to be somebody else, he dazzled people,"" Kuby said. ""For an evening or a couple of days, he mesmerized people by bringing them into his totally fictitious world of stardom."""

Antonio Banderas : Art / Bart Dodge


Daryl Hannah: Liz Kerner


Melanie Griffith: Betty

*The story:

Art Dodge is an art swindler. He looks at the death announcements in the papers. At the day of the funeral, th√™n he goes to the family and says that the dead person had bought a painting of him a few weeks before he died. At that moment, he meets Betty a rich woman who divorced the same man twice.

They fall in love with each other, but love becomes complicated when Art meets Betty's sister... he is deeply in love with her too. So he decides to transform himself in Bart (his twin brother) and then you get some humoristic moments, which aren't very funny at some moments.

Sheldon is the father of Art. Joan Cusack is the employee of Art.

An interesting note is that Melanie and Antonio fall in love on the set, and they married and had 1 child, Stella Banderas.

*Appreciation: This film is too confusing and although Daryl Hannah played her part wonderfully, the film has something of a disaster. Although the actors did their best to make a comedy. A catastrophe occurred

But don't forget that alL these actors had done some wonderful acting. Some examples; Melanie Griffith: Cecil B. Demented -- Daryl Hannah: Steel Magnolias -- Antonio Banderas: Philadelphia and Eli Wallach: the Misfits.

Sadly they made this time a wrong choice...

Mostly I like the movies that I saw and on the whole I give good comments about them. But this time I can only say that this film was a big disappointment and I hoped that it would have finished quickly. However I didn't lose my faith in the actors because it was just the wrong script that didn't work.

From the traumatic opening to the uplifting ending, you will be amazed at how well put together this film is. Patricia Arquette amazingly portrays Laura Bowman, who we meet as a shut-down and quit despondent young doctor, unable to deal with her grief over the loss of her husband and son. Throughout the course of the film, as she is trapped in Burma, witnesses the Democratic uprise and massacres in the capital city of Rangoon, flees for her life, and saves her tour-guide's (U Aung Ko's) life, she is regaining her will to live. This may seen contrived or heavy handed: it is not. John Boorman, a master at spiritual and emotional conflict, paints the film with broad strokes, and often uses symbolism to capture Laura's emotional state, and physical predicament. Patricia Arquette, as usual, gives a wonderfully convincingly and believable performance as the emotionally wounded Laura. What Arquette does amazingly, in any role that she plays, is give us a window into her character's heart without words. Every time she is given a close up in the film, the audience is given insight into her character. She does not need to speak to convey emotions, or be over the top. Some critics were harsh on Arquette's performance in the film when it opened on August 25, 1995, deeming that she was ""flat"" or ""dull"" in the role. I found her characterization dead-on, staying well away from the melodramatics that typically are part of an actor's performance when having a personally tragedy take place. She is on shock and is reserved about her feelings: that is just as normal as screaming lashing out at those around you. I am hoping that Warner Brothers releases this title on DVD very soon. With Arquette's hugely successful NBC drama"" Medium"" bringing her to household name status, not to mention an Emmy win and now 2007 nomination, it would be in the studio's best interest to do so. Hopefully there will be extras, with the alternate ending. Do not by pass by this film. It is one that you will certainly not forget after seeing."

It features two names forever etched into movie history; Ben Kingsley and Roman Polanski.

The pace is slow almost stagnant, and the characters are just unable to convince me that this is a way one would be likely to act if one should somehow find oneself in similar positions. The setting in some South American republic taking it's first steps towards democracy is made unrealistic by the fact that the language is English and neither Mr. nor Mrs. Escobar look all that South American.

Having said all this, it's not a bad movie. You do get a very uncomfortable feeling of what it might be like to be captured and robbed of your constitutional rights. I think Sigourney Waever does an excellent job. The scene, were she tells her husband what happened to her, is the best one in the movie.

In conclusion I'd say that this movie is more of an education than it is entertainment, but it's worth watching despite the obvious errors."

After Cobb's death, he recanted. He started in stag men's magazines, that also talk about aliens, and Voodoo. Hardly a reputable source. This is where he invented the details of the shooting. Eventually he gave credit for the details to a neighbor of Cobb. There's only one problem, this guy was dead 4 years before Cobb ever approached Stump to write his book! They never even traveled to Royston Georgia. Where Stump claims Cobb started telling Stump about the incident.

Stump stole tons of artifacts from the Estate and eventually got caught! This is the character of the story teller here folks. He was even selling multiple copies of forged letters! Forged Autographs. Writing new stories and selling Cobb memorabilia was his meal ticket.

Somehow this aspect never gets reported. Go ask anybody in the sports memorabilia market if they're interested in stuff from Al Stump, and get ready for an earful. It's all considered fake and forged. But what he said about Cobb is gospel? So I come here and read all these reviews and as usual people just believe all these things and even stamp them as authentic and true.

By the time Stump met Cobb he was elderly and frail. None of that manic misadventures stuff happened! There's no corroboration on any of those insanely made up movie events. Nobody shot off a gun in a casino. Or any of the rest of it.

Cobb was a curmudgeon who pushed everybody away, even family. Most of the Urban legends about him are just that. I run into old miserable guys all day long. I've actually been to Royston Georgia and interviewed people.

They all have stories about Cobb being off putting and speaking his mind. But they all also have stories about his generosity. He made it possible for children charities to thrive 70 years after his death. He donated the single biggest endowment in US history at the time. As the black lady who ran his Museum said ""Look around, who do you think that benefited?"" She also mentioned how all of his staff received pensions. Something unheard of back then.

I'm not saying the guy wasn't racist. From all of his quotes, he didn't particularly care for people of any race! But he came from a time period where everybody was racist.

There is only one truth in this entire movie. At the time of his death, he was considered far and wide the best player ever. By the sports writers who saw him play! Day in, day out. How that has morphed into him not even making lists nowadays is the true intolerance. While Ruth is still right there on on top of many."
1113,Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle (1994),01-Jan-1994,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," I am probably not the right person to review""Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle"" because I know nothing about the Algonquin Circle, or any of the people who made it up. But how many people do? Even in '94, when the movie was released, I wonder how many people were familiar with this very specific time and place.

I suppose you have to hand it to the filmmakers that they recreated this ""circle"" without much of a nod to all the people who didn't really know them going into the theatre, and, truth be told, probably won't feel like they know them any better going out. Most of the members are indistinguishable.

Parker was famous for her wit, but the movie really doesn't give you many examples of it. Nor does it exemplify the wit of the circle members. They just seem weird. Quirky, but not in a funny way. More just tiresome. I don't think I would have wanted to pal around with them.

The movie is probably at its best when it shows Parker's inevitable descent into alcoholism and mental illness. That doesn't happen until quite late, though. The movie mostly sees Parker as a part of the circle, not really showing what made her the stand out.

""Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle"" is a well done, well acted, portrait of people I didn't find particularly interesting. It taxed me, but I stuck with it. I can't recommend it to anyone who isn't familiar with at least most of the members of this ""circle""."
1114,Faithful (1996),03-Apr-1996,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Comedy']," Cher captivates the movie screen! She should undertake at least one project every other year for the rest of her life! Cher is such a joy to watch perform as an actor! Her personality electrifies!

I disagree with Leonard Maltin's assessment that this movie screen play written by it's original stage play writer, Chazz Palminteri, who also plays the movie role of ""Tony"" the Mafia-Mob hit-man, is a disappointment which ""simply doesn't work on film, despite good performances."" It does not do a movie justice to compare it with a stage play! For one, more people will see a movie in a century of time than see a limited run stage play!

This film is much better than the usual choppy, disorganized, and fluff movies that are turned out ""a dime a dozen"" by the movie industry. This film basically captures two performers in intense and engaging dialog which runs completely throughout the film. No special effects or special movie sounds are needed to keep the viewers' attention.

Cher and Palminteri blend well together. There is long and thoughtful dialog spoken in this film. All to the credit of writer Palminteri. Cher proves her professional merit and delivers her character's emotional personality with a soft sadness that is obvious when a 20 year marriage falls apart because of infidelity, adultery, and neurotic behavior. Yes, Cher has that twinkle in her eye and smile which tricks one to thinking this is some sort of black-comedy. The subject matter is not funny! It is just Cher being Cher! Think back to her ""VAMP"" comedy routine on the old Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour. Cher can't help it because she is so lovable that it just is there and you have to accept it!

I almost didn't recognize the professional actor Ryan O'Neal (Jack). He has gotten older when compared to his boyish look of his films from years past. Still, he delivers a quality performance because he is a quality actor! Of course he plays a louse of a husband who is cheating on his wife and hires Tony to kill Margaret (Cher). However, the ending is not what one would suspect from watching countless movies with the same basic plot of ""husband hires hit-man to kill wife."" Mr. Palminteri turns the tables in his writing! Well done.

Director Paul Mazursky also acts as Tony's psychiatrist. He does his therapy over the phone while the interaction between Cher and Palminteri is proceeding. Good character portrayal of a ""Shrink"" with his own problems.

Of course, this is what one calls a ""New York Story."" It is a ""common tale"" of wealthy New York lifestyles, stories often not apparent in Bangor, Maine, Mt. Hebo, Oregon, or Gainesville, Florida. One would expect these troubled lives in places like Manhattan and East Hampton, New York. Wherever the wealthy reside you get the notion that even with all their money you cannot be happy!

The film also makes good use of some flashback sequences which help to explain the actor's troubled past life. Well done cinematography.

One of the producers is Robert De Niro.

I really liked this film because of it's quality acting, it's method of telling the story, and the engaging dialog written for the characters and well-performed by the stars. There should be more movies with dialog like this instead of the one or two line phrases usually being uttered in many of today's ""hit"" movies.

Catch this movie on a TV cable channel or rent the video. Remember, it's a drama not a comedy so don't look for chuckles or canned laughter!

I rate this film a solid ""9"". Give us more CHER!"
1115,Twelfth Night (1996),25-Oct-1996,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance']"," In writing Twelfth Night (and the same goes for many other of his romantic comedies), Shakespeare showed that he was not only a genius at dark tragedy but also at light comedy. I saw a junior college production of this play which did live up to Shakespeare's intentions, which was in fact so funny I was falling off my chair.

Unfortunately, director Nunn will not allow a hilarious slapstick comedy to just be a hilarious slapstick comedy. Apparently he succumbed to the notion that everything Shakespearean has somehow to seem profound, which in this case results in an attempt to transfer this light, sparkling comedy, full of deliberately overdrawn characters and silly lines and pratfalls, into a brooding tragedy in which pompous ass Malvolio acts as if he were, or imagined himself to be, Hamlet caught in the wrong play, while clown Feste is misanthropic to the point of sadism. There is no suggestion of comic timing anywhere in this film!

It appears that once Nunn decided to insist on a modern-dress version, he adopted as his mentor the let's-portray-the-messed-up-dysfunctional-household school. This is stupid. A better mentor would have been a closer modern equivalent of what Shakespeare was doing in this play. Something like I Love Lucy or Amos 'n' Andy or The Honeymooners, in other words.

One thing that entirely puzzles me is: why the devil didn't Nunn exploit the particular advantages of the cinema in depicting this gender-bender story of a girl impersonating a look-alike boy? Why in sam hill didn't Nunn have a male actor who is skilled at female impersonation, or an actress skilled at impersonating males, play both roles on a split screen? (See, for the sort of impersonation I refer to, Vanessa Redgrave as the trans-sexual tennis player in Second Serve.) In other words: Why transform a stage play into a film at all, if you're not going to put the advantages of the cinema, as opposed to those of the stage, to work? Nunn's treatment of this play is not only a mangled interpretation, it's unimaginative.

Ben Kingsley is the only performer who does very much with his part, and what he does he does very well. His acting creates a very interesting character, and his interpretation of Feste is certainly consistent, but it receives no support whatsoever from the text."

If you want to see Gary Cooper in an Ernest Hemingway story, stick with ""For Whom the Bell Tolls""; this first attempt to adapt a Hemingway novel into a feature film is badly dated, even to the point of embarrassment (unless ""no"" didn't actually mean ""no"" in the 1930s). Cooper's WWI soldier and Hayes' Red Cross nurse share a rampant, ill-fated romance, though the chemistry they share is as limited as their height difference is distracting. The ending (and scenes leading up to it), a mix of limp acting and overwrought melodrama, is a slog to sit through; originally released with an alternate ""happy ending"" that theaters could choose between for the screenings! Redeemed somewhat by Charles Lang's assured, Oscar-winning photography and Menjou's zesty performance as Cooper's Italian friend. Remade multiple times, including once as a miniseries; Hemingway's experiences that inspired his semi-autobiographical novel were dramatized in the 1996 film ""In Love and War.""

No film in history, to my memory, seduces the viewer into actively co-creating the piece as it unreels, as does ""The Innocents."" Immediately, vividly, and subtly, it arrests then implicates the viewer in every frame.

Its first ""image,"" in fact, is a blank (black) screen -- and the haunting sound of a child's song. Instantly, viewers unconsciously react, emotionally (as to all music), to the beguiling yet off-putting song and the voice. Emotional tension, established immediately.

Yet, one's mind never stops producing thoughts and images. So, without any visual cues from the screen, the haunting song produces images in viewers' own minds -- each no doubt different. Already, then, viewers are seduced into supplying their own mental images and, whether they know it yet or not, have been brilliantly and subliminally placed in the Deborah Kerr role. This, before a single production credit has appeared. We are watching a shadow: a nothing. And our minds demand we fill it with something.

Thus does Jack Clayton's astonishing ""The Innocents"" begin. Certainly, other films have used the same opening device. But none with ""The Innocents'"" payoff.

For, as it develops (based on Henry James', ""The Turn of the Screw""), ""The Innocents'"" themes are, ""What do you see? What do you believe is true? Is it? Who is 'innocent?' The children? The nanny? You?"" The emotional undertow is inescapable, perhaps more so because two-thirds of the trio of protagonists are ""children in peril,"" always a surefire hook.

But ""in peril"" from what, exactly? Deborah Kerr's possible paranoia / schizophrenia? Ghosts? Or our own powerful, perhaps lurid, imaginings of what may or may not have happened to these children from their deceased and perhaps sexually perverse tutors? The children's memories or imaginings of what did or didn't happen? The film unfolds with some of the most beautiful cinematography in history (Freddie Francis). ""The Innocents"" requires full-size screening, or at least letterboxing to fully appreciate the visual poetry supporting the suspense.

Jack Clayton's production and direction rank among the finest in screen history.

The miraculous work he pulls from his cast is uniformly jaw-dropping.

Despite Deborah Kerr's ravishing natural beauty, one never recalls even a single performance in which she was ""Deobrah Kerr"": she was always the character -- whether a nun (""Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison""), an adulterous sexpot (""From Here to Eternity""), a Tennessee Williams underdog (""Night of the Iguana""), a strong-willed soprano-singing teacher (""The King and I"") or a romantic comedienne (""An Affair to Remember"").

Contrast Kerr's beauty, talent and career with Elizabeth Taylor, say. Equally ravishing, one was always aware of watching Miss Taylor ""act."" Even in stunt casting, like her Martha in ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" or the debacle of ""Cleopatra."" Miss Kerr is the real thing. So are Megs Jenkins (Mrs. Grose), Martin Stephens (Miles) and Pamela Franklin (Flora).

The story and filming progressively grow more audacious, until the last heartbreaking sequence between Kerr and young Stephens.

By then, of course, our hearts and minds are so thoroughly complicit in the goings on that the final cry heard on the soundtrack, before we are left again in the blank, black void of our own hearts and imaginings at all we've just lived through, before credits begin to roll, leaves us with perhaps the most haunting of all cinematic experiences.

Why? Because we have made the film as it went along, as fully involved as any character in it -- our own minds contributing all that's unspoken and unseen.

""The Innocents"" is the ""Citizen Kane"" of its genre. And like ""Citizen Kane,"" it transcends genres.

This is an immortal achievement by a team of filmic artists at their peaks. A revelation of what film can be."

Such stars as Gary Cooper, Gregory Peck, Tyrone Power, Rock Hudson, and Humphrey Bogart have taken a turn at being Hemingway heroes. I guess it was Spencer Tracy's turn to do it now.

I'm not sure that any actor no matter how good they are could keep the audiences attention on him for 90 minutes just alone in a boat, struggling to hook the mother of all marlins. But Spencer Tracy is as good as they get and I'm not sure he did it either. But Tracy ought to be commended for trying, in fact an Oscar nomination came in the way of a commendation.

One thing I will say, Tracy may have been the least vain actor on the screen. When a whole lot of his contemporaries were still doing romantic leads, Tracy let his age and everything else all hang out in this story of an old Cuban fisherman with two passions, baseball and fishing. His favorite ball player, who else but Joe DiMaggio the son of an Italian fisherman. The old man's passion; to go fishing with Joe DiMaggio. Actually in real life, DiMaggio honed his baseball skills to get away from the life his father and the old man led.

Of course there's that epic struggle with the marlin and what happens after. Hemingway goes Melville on us here, the big fish is the old man's white whale. Of course unlike Captain Ahab, it's an individual struggle, Tracy doesn't take a whole crew down with him because of his obsession.

It was a great effort and Tracy and director John Sturges deserve an A for effort here in trying to film an essentially plot less story. I suppose The Old Man and the Sea found an audience with fishermen and Spencer Tracy fans."

This show is on 24/7, following every little detail of Truman's life. His little town is all he knows, and for years, he is okay with it. Since he is the star of the show, he is the center of attention of the town. Eventually this fact sticks out to him; Truman starts to figure out that something isn't right and decides to do something about it. He tries to escape, but he encounters many obstacles keeping him on the TV show's island. This movie inflates the idea of how far we will go for our own pleasure. In the movie, the whole world knows about the TV show, that the main actor is being watched 24/7 without knowing it, and that his life is being controlled by the cast and directors, yet they do nothing about it. In fact, they don't want to do anything about it; they enjoy it. Truman has no privacy, but no one seems to care; it must be alright since they are getting entertainment out of it, right? The movie also uses irony to convince the audience of flaws in our society. When Truman is struggling in his life, he turns to his ""best friend"" who talks to him using the director's words spoken to him over his earpiece. One of the most ironic line in the movie, in my opinion, was when Truman's best friend turns to him during a serious conversation and says, ""The last thing I would ever do is lie to you,"". This is ironic, because of course as he says this, he is lying. He is trying to convince Truman that he is just thinking crazy thoughts and everything is normal, when he actually knows that the whole world is watching is life play out. The Truman Show really makes us reflect on our lives; how far do we go for our own pleasure? It uses many satirical elements to convince us of this flaw. At first, while watching the movie, we find it crazy and over-the-top at this world's crazy idea of reality TV. When we stop and think about it, it makes us wonder how far-fetched it really is."

Trying to get satisfied with 10 points breaks my heart as much as the stories in the film did which are based on two men suffering from love, like the other millions on the planet. The main difference between this one and other romance films is Chong qing sen ling doesn't picture eternal love, people holding hands in hands, kissing or crying and moaning in pain when it's is over. It's more about lead characters just trying to get over the pain and discovering that undying love was never that strong indeed. Talking about getting over the pain, since it's a Kar Wai Wong nobody will dare thinking a typical work.

At the first time i watched Chong qing sen ling, what hit me was director's original style in telling his stories, how he could make me feel exactly the same mood with the characters and still no tears in the whole movie. (Besides who needs tears while you can get rid of them by making some sports?) In fact if you are terribly under the influence of this film and you are dumbed by your lover too, don't be surprised when you find yourself drinking five or ten glasses of water in a row or something equally stupid as that. Because stupidity is what we are expected to do when messed with love anyway. Before, through or after the relation, it really doesn't matter, does it?

1131,Safe (1995),01-Jan-1995,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,['Thriller']," Having seen the movie and read the viewer comments on IMDb, I think I understand why this film seems to elicit such a broad range of reactions: it is a movie that presents a story from multiple points of view without specifically directing the viewer as to which view takes precedence. Moreover, the multiple points of view are intertwined and, in some cases, at odds with one another. As such, this film demands a lot more from its audience than most are accustomed to. The beauty of the film lies in the deceptively simple, almost transparent manner in which a complex story with no easy answers is presented.

The main theme of the movie is reflected in the title: what is it that constitutes a feeling of ""safety"" in our lives? What do we require in order to feel safe? What are the conditions and situations that threaten our idea of feeling safe? Is it possible to construct a world of perfect safety around our lives and if it is, what are the consequences and side effects? The answers to all these questions are more often than not subject to the ideas and opinions of each individual rather than being universal in nature. In the case of Carol White, the focus of the movie, these are questions she is forced (or possibly forces herself?) to confront, with the odds of success being 50-50 at best.

""Safe"" explores some of the themes Haynes tackled in ""Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story."" (This movie is hard to find, though you might want to check out the illegal-art dot org web site.) There are a number of similarities between the two films: the view-from-a-car shots of bland suburban streets and the power lines to which they are tethered; the consumer-driven lifestyle of most Americans; the depiction of people as mannequins; the focus on one's external life to the detriment of one's inner life. But while ""Superstar"" takes a more militant stance, ""Safe"" is far less judgmental, which in turn makes it a far more subversive film."

A cross-section of black America charter a bus from L.A. to Washington for the 1995 Million Man March. On board there's a gay couple, a loud-mouth prick actor who gives everyone a hard time, a son shackled to his dad by court order, a light-skinned cop, a reformed gang-banger, a film student taping the trip, Ossie Davis as an old-timer used and spat-out by the white man, and an assortment of other personalities. Along the way, they fight, they bond, and Spike gets as many mouthpieces as he wants to repeatedly tackle the same old subjects. Here, Spike is trying to show the diversity of black America by giving everyone different views, but his black take on The Symposium feels inorganic, cringingly melodramatic, the interactions are...nobody interacts that way, not even in plays! This adds little that's fresh to his filmography, and does little to draw him out of the rut most of his career's been mired in (I love the guy, but many of his works are redundant, and I know these issues mean a lot to him, but his delivery on this one is especially stale). Still, I didn't hate the movie. At best, it's one of his more 'ok' efforts."
1135,"Doors, The (1991)",01-Jan-1991,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['Drama', 'Musical']"," First off, The Doors are my favorite band. EVER. No one can match up to their revolutionary style, their originality, or the music. They are truly THE GREATEST AMERICAN BAND. And one of the most influential bands. EVER. Also one of the most controversial bands. Those are just some of the reasons why The Doors are my fav.

Anyway...the Oliver Stone film is good, but not a spectacular piece of work. I did enjoy watching it and would also recommend it. If you never listened to The Doors or aren't really into them then I think this flick will get you interested in the band and their music. But for the most part the movie seems to focus too much on Morrison and in some parts when it does, it seems fake. For example, when Jim is talking or arguing with his girl he is always taking a line from one of his songs and/or from his poems. If you listened to the music before then you would know what I mean. It seems Stone didn't know what to write so he just borrowed some lines from a song/poem and put them in the script. And the preformance by Kilmer is very good, but not great. It seems as if he's trying too hard to become him and when he does he seems to go overboard. But as a movie this is good. As a biography about Jim Morrison this is mediocre. Even the fellow members of The Doors say Morrison isn't portrayed 100%, saying that the movie just portrayed the bad, drunk, disgusting Morrison and never really showed the good humored, shy, sensitive Morrison.

Well, at least there's still the music."
1136,Ghosts of Mississippi (1996),20-Dec-1996,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," A fairly decent film, but not one to inspire mass demonstrations for continued change to society. Whoopi Goldberg is regal as the grieving Widow Edgers. Baldwin is competant but a tad boring as the Ass't D.A. And Woods is heavily made-up, but does a fine job of making you squirm, even if he only gets to do it in a few scenes. Somehow, you just don't get too riled up at what's going on for these people, except when ""Delay"" gets up on his White Supremisist Horse. You should get scared for Baldwin's family what with all the threats, but you don't. You should feel the tension in his parent's dissaproval of his following of the case, but you don't. Odd. This film's most surprizing facet is Rob Reiner's direction - if you thought all he could do was comedy, then see this movie and realize his capabilities. Even though there are many things that you don't care about - which I mentioned in the paragraph above - I was still impressed by Reiner's strong sense of story and character. He just needed to either tighten up the editing, or get the actors to raise the intensity of what is at stake for them in the movie. All in all, a good story, good direction, some good performances, but it's not inspirational."

The fairly heavy British accent throws me badly as well, so it was lucky that captioning was provided, but having to read the dialog rather than listening to it makes it harder for me to get emotionally involved in the story.

The many glowing comments I've read on this site are, I think, very well deserved, but because of the difficulties mentioned above born of being a Middle-America Yankee made it hard to really enjoy the film. had it been filmed in the US, by an American director, I'd probably be giving the film a 9 or 10. My ""6"" reflects my overall enjoyment, though the actual movie quality is decidedly higher. I wish all gay romances could - in real life - end as shown in this film, but I have to wonder: What happened to them after they danced?

But I guess that's subject matter for another movie."

1139,Hackers (1995),01-Jan-1995,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"['Action', 'Crime', 'Thriller']"," ""Hackers,"" the 1995 cyberpunk thriller directed by Iain Softley, is a cinematic time capsule that transports viewers back to the early days of the internet, dial-up connections, and a burgeoning hacker subculture. From the perspective of a cybersecurity expert, the film earns its solid 7/10 rating by embracing its over-the-top cyber antics, vibrant style, and a surprisingly accurate portrayal of hacking elements for its time.

One of the standout features of ""Hackers"" is its unapologetic embrace of cyberpunk aesthetics. The film immerses audiences in a world where hacking is portrayed as a subversive form of counterculture, complete with neon-soaked visuals, underground clubs, and a pulsating soundtrack. While the style may be exaggerated, it captures the spirit of the mid-'90s hacker ethos, making it a nostalgic experience for cybersecurity enthusiasts.

From a technical standpoint, ""Hackers"" surprisingly gets some aspects of hacking right. The film incorporates real hacking terminology, albeit with a Hollywood flair, and showcases a level of technical detail that sets it apart from other cyber-themed movies of its era. It manages to convey a sense of the thrill and creativity associated with hacking, even if the on-screen depictions are embellished for dramatic effect.

The ensemble cast, led by a young Angelina Jolie and Jonny Lee Miller, injects energy and charisma into the film. Their portrayal of a group of young hackers navigating a cyber conspiracy adds a relatable human element to the story, making it more than just a showcase of flashy computer screens and digital landscapes.

While ""Hackers"" is undeniably entertaining, it does have its share of flaws. The hacking sequences, while more accurate than many other films of its time, are still dramatized for cinematic appeal. Some may find the plot predictable, and the film's portrayal of hacking tools and techniques may seem rudimentary to modern cybersecurity professionals.

In summary, ""Hackers"" earns its 7/10 rating by virtue of its unique time-capsule quality, blending cyberpunk aesthetics with an entertaining narrative. While not a documentary on hacking, it captures the spirit of the era and offers a surprisingly engaging portrayal of cybersecurity culture in the mid-'90s. For cybersecurity experts, it's a trip down memory lane with just enough technical authenticity to make it a fun and nostalgic watch."
1140,"Road to Wellville, The (1994)",01-Jan-1994,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Comedy']," I have come to realize that my sense of humor is very much out of sync with mainstream film tastes. Frequently, I have seen a comedy that leaves me in hysterics, only to discover that it is loathed by the mainstream media and masses alike. ""The Road To Wellville"" is one of these films.

When I first saw ""The Road To Wellville"" on Cinemax in the mid-nineties, I could not believe just how much crass and bawdy humor was packed into this film, and I could not stop laughing. Up to that time, I could not recall any other film so unashamedly filled with scatological references. I especially enjoyed the great Anthony Hopkins voicing the eccentric views of Dr. John Kellogg while defining a very strange but memorable character.

Of course, the critics panned this film for the very reasons I initially loved it. Seeing it again, I can understand their revulsion. While the film is packed with many hilariously tasteless gags, the overall story is very erratic. The main plot involving Matthew Broderick's bizarre medical treatments is rather entertaining, but John Cusack's subplot is neither very funny nor well-written. By the three-quarters mark, the film loses momentum and becomes just another tedious romantic comedy. Such a shame, considering the outrageously satirical nature of the first few acts of this film. The laughs are there, but the story is not."
1141,"War Room, The (1993)",01-Jan-1993,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Documentary']," This is one of the great political films since All the President's Men, and one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. The story is fascinating, the characters are very interesting, and its all real. Even the music adds to the frenetic pace of the film.

The documentary follows the 1992 Clinton Campaign from the doldrums in New Hampshire, through the Democratic convention in New York to its summit on election night in Little Rock. But Clinton spends very little time on the screen. The film captures the behind-the-scenes action of James Carville, George Stephanopolis, and the rest of the cast and crew of Clinton campaign headquarters. The film shows how TV spots are written, how interviews are managed, how the candidates' message is distributed, and how the ""spin doctors"" do their stuff.

The pace is quick. Staffers come into and out of scenes constantly, and there is a great deal of off-camera dialogue, much like an emergency-room scene from E.R. The mix of standard documentary footage with news reports and interviews is terrific. Some of the best scenes are of the pols watching the news reports and reacting to what they see.

The central character is James Carville, who is more interesting than anyone else in the campaign, much moreso than the candidates themselves. He reveals that his ""Ragin' Cajun"" image is genuine, for he is truly passionate about his work. But it also reveals a mind working on overdrive, and a sensitive nature that you wouldn't expect to see. His ""people will say you are lucky"" speech to staffers at the end of the film is as moving as anything written for the studio, and moreso because it is genuine.

Stephanopolis came off less well. Behind his youthful looks and seeming intelligence comes a certain shallowness. Much of his contribution was more of a ""me too"" nature than anything truly creative or deep. He also had a moment at the end of the film when, in a room with a starry-eyed female staffer, he's describing how he feels. And the conclusion is, not much. It is not hard to understand why years later George was a washout in the Clinton White House, never managed another campaign, and is now earning his living in front of the camera.

After all is said and done, it is clear that the candidate is secondary in a modern presidential election. He's like the hand your dealt in a game of poker. It's important, but what you do with it once it is dealt to you is much more important. And these guys are pros.

So are the filmmakers. There were several times when I had to remind myself that this was a documentary, and not a work of fiction. In fact, if you see it immediately after seeing ""Primary Colors"" you'll see that truth is not only stranger than fiction, but it can be more interesting as well."
1142,When We Were Kings (1996),14-Feb-1997,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Documentary']," A testament to the greatness of the man, the myth & the legend, When We Were Kings documents the build-up to arguably the greatest sporting event of the 20th century and follows the 32-year old Muhammad Ali as he starts training for the historic boxing bout against the undefeated world heavyweight champion George Foreman which was held in Congo in 1974 and was billed as ""Rumble in the Jungle"".

Directed by Leon Gast, it may have taken him 22 years to bring this documentary to cinematic life but it still packs a hard-hitting knockout punch that can floor its viewers. The film not only takes into account the preparation of both fighters but also delves into Ali's beliefs, political stance & powerful connection with the African crowd before heading into the memorable match that left the world shell-shocked to its core.

It also provides a brief overview of Congo's (then known as Zaire) history, its ruthless dictator, its music & rich culture. Also present are many interviews with reporters or journalists who had rather strong opinions about Ali. The fight in itself, though not shown in its entirety, is riveting from start to finish. It shows how quick, tactical & inventive Ali was with both his hands & his mind as he takes on a younger, unbeaten champion in his prime.

Overall, When We Were Kings is one of the best sports documentaries out there, and certainly makes for a welcome tribute to the Greatest whose cocky attitude, larger-than-life aura, strong voice & gifted in-ring ability made him an enduring icon of the sport with a legacy that still has no equals. Packed with adrenaline & burning with passion, this Academy Award-winning documentary is entertaining, inspiring & rewarding in more ways than one and comes highly recommended."
1143,Hard Eight (1996),28-Feb-1997,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"['Crime', 'Thriller']"," Sydney is an old gambler who shows kindness to a man he meets outside a diner. He helps out John by lending him ¬£50 and then teaching him enough about gambling to make his way. Two years later finds John loyally sticking with John and adoring him. However, their relationship is put under pressure when John hooks up with Clementine, a cocktail waitress who also turns tricks and Jimmy, a low life with no respect for Sydney.

Although it was pretty badly treated in the UK and mostly ignored and overlooked, the success of Anderson's films since has given many a reason to look back on Hard Eight (the much better but less meaningful title given it for the UK release) and `discover' it. It certainly is an impressive film and it is difficult to see why it received neither financial or critic success when it was released. The plot is deceptive - starting as a character piece, changing violently with a series of twists and then reverting back to the character piece we started with.

The film is totally driven by it's characters and they are very well written to the point that we care about them even before we really know all about them. The title `Sydney' is more meaningful simply because the film is pretty much all about Sydney himself. He is a kind man and we wonder why but are gradually won over his gentle nature. This makes the second half of the film more thrilling simply because we think we know Sydney but then he has to do things we think are not in him. Anderson directs with a remarkable assurance; he has style and a real sense of framing. He mixes close ups with wider shots using the fluorescent lighting of the gambling joints to good effect - his direction is as good here as it was in his other, more acclaimed films.

The main thing that makes this film so good though, is the cast. Hall is excellent; I cannot stress how good he is here - his character is well written but it is Hall that makes it work so well with a performance that is subtle and controlled. Reilly is a great character actor and he does the same here with a hangdog expression and put upon attitude. Paltrow is very good for someone whom people seem to have forgotten can actually act. Her Clementine is more complex that first appears. However despite her good work, I think that Paltrow's limited screen time actually helps the film - she is not the focus here. Jackson is his usual cool self and turns in a memorable performance while Anderson even has a part for Hoffman.

I can imagine some people will not like this film: it is talky for long sections and it ends with questions to be answered - this may frustrate some people but for me I felt it allowed me to think for myself and use what I had learnt about Sydney. This is a surprisingly mature film from such a young director and one that you owe it to yourself to undercover in retrospect."
1144,"Quiet Room, The (1996)",02-May-1997,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," I was very interested in the premise of the story as described on the cover...that a young girl, without the words to express what she feels, becomes convinced of the uselessness of words and stops talking. I think this is brilliant! (I often wonder what is in my own children's minds when they stare off in silence.)

However, I was quite unimpressed with the story's unfolding. I was left feeling rather annoyed by the abundant use of voice over which spoiled the whole idea of her silence for me. I wanted to see things as she saw them and feel the tension that only silence can create but instead I was assaulted by a constant stream of interpretations and explanations that were already there in the action or in her beautifully expressive face.

While the child actors were usually very engaging, I found it difficult to reconcile the erratic speech patterns as written, especially in the adults, with an interpretation of the world from the young girl's point of view.

In all, I was disappointed. Such a wonderful premise but such poor writing and character development.

Deep sigh."
1145,Blue Chips (1994),01-Jan-1994,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,['Drama']," On this one, I feel like Barney Stinson from ""How I Met Your Mother,"" where a running gag was that Barney considered the baddies in movies to be the good guys--basically the premise for the ""Cobra Kai"" reworking of ""The Karate Kid"" series. So, in ""Blue Chips,"" we have a booster named ""Happy"" played menacingly by perennial-villain J. T. Walsh who encourages Nick Nolte's impersonation of an artless coach Bob Knight type to pay the college basketball team's ""blue chip"" recruits under the table. Nolte's coach Pete Bell even scoffs at Happy's argument that the players deserve compensation for making them rich, and he inevitably has a crisis of conscience--because heaven forbid a few of the best players be paid a pittance for the billions-of-dollars business they perform in and including making college-sports coaches, such as the fictional one here who throws tantrums in the locker room--screaming in their faces and throwing stuff--the highest paid state employees in parts of the United States. If there's a hero in ""Blue Chips,"" it's not coach Bell; it's Happy.

The NCAA is a racket, and ""Blue Chips"" is at its best when it seems to explore that corruption, but when it goes all Pollyanna about the supposed purity of a game and weepy over breaking the rules where unpaid young adults entertain and are distracted from doing any actual studying for huge, crowded stadiums--bigger than the high-school one they used for filming here--and for TV and in between commercials to make coaches, executives and, perhaps, even gamblers millionaires, it's nauseating. Recently, the real NCAA has been forced to allow student athletes some compensation, so at least now they may be underpaid above board. Happy vindicated, I suppose.

As for the basketball, my favorite sport by the way, it certainly benefits from featuring actual basketball players, including NBA stars Shaquille O'Neal and Anfernee Hardaway, the latter of whom is said to have been traded for by O'Neal's Orlando Magic based on their relationship working on this film. But, the hoop scenes here do suffer from the appearance of seemingly just being recordings of them playing impromptu scrimmage games in high-school gymnasiums to later be edited into a semblance of stories of supposed games. The rest of the film, however, doesn't benefit at all from, in particular, O'Neal's mugging. This isn't ""Inside the NBA"" on TNT; someone edit out this cutesy giant schtick for the cutting-room floor. And what's the point of epilogue text for what happened to the coach and players when it's a fictional story? It just looks hackneyed and stupid, as does much of the rest of ""Blue Chips."""

A whole lot of pointless dialogues going round and round ... discussions about some old book that we don't care for anyway ... annoying characters on the screen (like the author of that Holocaust book that made me cringe 10 times at least during the movie wishing he would shut up and stop whining about everything from the coffee he was drinking to the editors he was meeting) ...

The stubborn old man in the lead was also quite boring (not too mention hard headed) and then last part of the movie where he finally goes off his rockers (big surprise, pretty clear from the get go this guy has serious ""issues"" !) for good is really bad ... lots of scenes that made me think ""oh, come on"" and wish I could slap the old dude back into reality at once... or maybe send him to an asylum ...

I couldn't wait for this ""thing"" to end ... 1.5/5 I saw this movie just recently and was certainly disappointed ... not that I was expecting a masterpiece either but it was sooooooo long and uninteresting I nearly fell asleep at the 2/3's point ...
