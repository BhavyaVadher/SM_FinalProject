Movie,Review
Charade (1963),"Regina (Audrey Hepburn) comes Paris from a vacation where knew Peter (Gary Grant) and finds that her husband Charlie has been murdered and which he was more than he seemed , as the police (Jacques Marin) produces several passports that show Charlie with a different name and disguise . She also discovers that she now has a trio (James Coburn, George Kennedy) of her spouse's former colleagues following her , looking for his hidden cache of money . Regina on the run from crooks and double agents who want the loot her husband stole during WWII .

This is a sparklingly sophisticated comedy/thriller/romance with Donen's stylish direction and full of plot twists and red herrings . From the opening credits by Maurice Binder to the ending entertainment and amusement is well provided . Donen is prepared to resort to all the tricks in the cinematic trade to make this a fascinating thriller . Amusing scenes as the dancing with the orange on the body, Gary Grant in the shower , along with exciting sequences as a rooftop fight between Grant and Kennedy and a nasty firing his pistol at the protagonists through a marble pillars . Due to the suspense, the stars, and the frequent plot twists, many people believe that this is an Alfred Hitchcock film . This confusion has prompted fans of the film to call it ""the best Hitchcock film that Hitchcock never made"". Gary Grant is amusingly enigmatic and provides the glamorous mystery element in the plot . A sympathetic Audrey Hepburn is excellent as widow involved in a sinister goings-on around death her husband, she manages to change her Givenchy's dresses at various scenes . Hepburn won prize British Academy to best actress. Glamorous and sophisticated cinematography by Charles Lang . Enjoyable score by Henry Mancini with lyric by Johnny Mandel including catching and classic musical leitmotif .

The motion picture was magnificently directed by Stanley Donen who made in similar style ¨Arabesque¨ with Gregory Peck and Sophia Loren . The posterior Donen films were heavy-handed , exception of ¨Two for the road¨ again with Hepburn , and too few to show if the magic had really gone . It's remade at an inferior version by Jonathan Demme titled ¨The truth about Charlie (2002)¨ with Mark Wahlberg (Peter) and Thandie Newton (Regina) . Rating : Very good, it makes relaxing entertaining and it's a real seat-gripper ."
"Fox and the Hound, The (1981)","For some reason, this animated feature from the Disney stable had eluded me until now - even if I remember it being shown in local theaters on original release: I understand that it's among the less well-regarded efforts, but I found it a cute little film overall; even so, the plot line (adapted from a book by Daniel P. Mannix) is somewhat thin and the songs (never my favorite element in these films) very pedestrian. As a matter of fact, it's the various endearing characters which make it watchable - and not just the titular duo (the surprising, but most capable, cast of voice actors includes such veterans as Jack Albertson, Pearl Bailey, John Fiedler, John McIntire, Jeanette Nolan, and Mickey Rooney as Tod the Fox); that said, the romantic interest which crops up during its last third proves a distraction from the central relationship - which is quite movingly developed. Ultimately, though, the animation itself seems rather flat and uninspired: it's clearly a case of ""we've been here before"" and this leads to few, if any, memorable highlights. By the way, as per the regrettable Disney Studios custom of late, a direct-to-video sequel recently appeared."
"Big Blue, The  1988)","Interesting but slow, long and clumsy.

The story of two childhood friends with a love for the sea and diving. They drift apart but are reunited by the competitive world of free diving. Their eagerness to set new depth records drives them to incredible feats, and great danger...

Starts off quite amateurishly. The childhood scenes and the acting therein is quite badly done. However, it gets better after that and the plot is interesting enough. It never does shake that clumsy amateurishness present in the first few scenes though.

Is very slow and overly long too. Far too many scenes in the movie that could easily have been cut or at least edited somewhat.

Performances are mostly OK, but not brilliant. Nobody really stands out. Jean Reno is probably the best of the bunch."
Georgia (1995),"Jennifer Jason Leigh here pulls off another of her 'impossible' performances. Is there any film actress as versatile as she is? Is there anything she can't do or any role she cannot play? When she acts, she throws herself into the role with the force of an express train. Here she transforms into a hopeless, cheery, ever-smiling flop of a girl, who has failed at everything but just goes on in good humour, taking it on the chin from Life time after time. Her pathetic, sprawling, inept character is endlessly endearing, like a delightful child, even though she drives everyone she knows crazy because she is so hopeless. She can't stay off the drugs, or the booze, or out of bed with anyone for a quickie. She doesn't know when to start, she doesn't know when to stop. She is behaviour-dyslexic. Her thoroughly controlled and successful older sister gets her revenge on little sister by extending icy and permanent tolerance, disguising condescension as devotion. The two sisters are both singers, and the older one, Georgia of the title (though the star is really Sadie, the Leigh character), is a magnificent folk singer with a marvellously controlled and captivating voice (must get Winningham's CDs!). She is played brilliantly by Mare Willingham, who was justly nominated for an Oscar for it. As for Leigh, she won best actress awards from the New York Film Critics Circle Awards (highly prestigious in the USA), and the Montreal Film Festival. Leigh can sing better than she does in the film because it is part of the role that she must not be very good. However, she throws herself totally into every song she sings, and unbearably heart-rending emotion is her specialty. What a contrast to the cold control shown by her sister, who stands erect and formal, while Leigh throws herself all over the stage and repeatedly swallows and vomits up the microphone, and everything hangs out like long johns on the washing line which the neighbours don't want to see. The film is incredibly sensitive and profound, a triumph by Ulu Grosbard, who made too few films in his career, and is now well into his 80s. This is REAL film-making, and one of the endless parade of spectacular achievements by the incomparably brilliant Jennifer Jason Leigh, and surely one of her best."
"Indian in the Cupboard, The (1995)","Even though I rated this plucky movie a 4, it doesn't mean I hate it, my dear friends. I liked it but it doesn't have the stuff to make it to my higher favoritism of movies. Frank Oz is imaginative, but I have to say that this film to me is not so Frank Oz, and movies that are adapted from books are quite impressive, but I can only say I was slightly impressed. For one thing, the cast is inadequate, I never heard of David Keith and Litefoot.

This story follows Omri, an extremely childish youngster who, for his birthday, receives a MAGICAL (ooh!) cupboard. The Cupboard lacks its key so Omri's mother (actress Lindsay Crouse, never heard of her), gives him her collection of keys, and guess what? He finds the certain key on his second try! That part always took me aback. He puts in an antique Iroquois figure in the cupboard, and later in the morning he opens it to find the figure alive as a small Iroquois man. The pair has many tedious adventures, some including an idiotic rat ball and a down-right scruffy cowboy who was a toy figure too. The cupboard MAGICALLY turns plastic (plaz-teck!) things into their real life counterparts, only smaller. The pair soon learns that every boy must become a man (a typical, yet true moral).

Omri's character really is childish, yet endearing; his parents seem to pamper him, he's afraid of the dark, and he has lame 90's action figures; but he does mellow out in the end of the movie. I liked the acting, but it was no To Kill a Mocking Bird, even at moving parts. The Iroquois man was different from other Indian movies; he was a guru in a way. The music was just moderate and odd, though with one exception you'll know when you hear it.

Be warned, my dear readers, this movie contains slight profanity (embarrassing really); simulative killing and some ladies do a loathsome dance on TV at one point (they call this a kid movie, how embarrassing. Let's hope Omri was sleeping at that adultish scene). And no the kid does not play God, its just a story, have fun. Other than the 3 points I pointed out, the movie is plucky and it has a rather moving ending. It's an poorish if okay movie."
Blue in the Face (1995),"Two things need to be understood, Brooklyn and Wayne Wang. Can those of you who saw Chang is Missing, really pretend that Wayne Wang's films push the envelope? I mean, it's always a bit beyond the cutting edge with WW. A great film maker, he has a great sense of humor and is smart enough to let actors take their heads sometimes. OK. Now, Brooklyn. Forget this crap about ""New York,"" if you know Brooklyn and especially, the OLD Brooklyn of, say, 1956, that last great year of the Dodgers [I was a young Naval officer there in Brooklyn Naval Shipyard that year], then you know there's a HUGE cultural barrier separating NY from there. Now, you're getting warm. OK, when I saw Smoke, I saw a teaser of a sequel. Now, we all know sequels generally suck but Smoke had that extra something that made me want to risk a buck to see Keitel in action again. Well, waited and waited and then, this is on the shelves. It's a GEM! Don't listen to those chumps who don't know squat about WW or Brooklyn and, hey, let me ask you...did you pay to go see that Star Wars Prequel? Sure you did. So don't gripe. This is the great SMOKE PREQUEL! Go Wayne Wang! Up with Brooklyn, old (definitely not new, i.e ., LA) Dodgers, Belgian waffles, and Sexy Puerto Rican girls dialoguing with themselves in the mirror, saying ""Ju lik Epanish gorls?"" YES!"
Unzipped (1995),"First off, I must say that I am not the likely audience for a film like this. I know almost nothing about fashion and have difficulty getting into documentaries. I did see this years ago, about the time it hit video, and while I liked Isaac, the movie didn't hold my interest.

Fast forward to 2008, I've been watching Ugly Betty for two seasons. It is another unlikely choice for me, but it's over the top enough to be fun. Everyone around me loves The Devil Wears Prada, so I've seen that several times as well.

Then Unzipped reappears on satellite TV, and as I watch it I see a first hand look at the world that Betty and Devil are only reflecting. Seeing it in this context I found a whole new appreciation for this movie. It's interesting, funny and dramatic in places, and it's beautifully shot. Maybe there are a lot of documentary clichés at work here, but who better to give the glamorous black and white treatment to than supermodels and fashionistas? It works, extremely well, now I understand better where it comes from. Why settle for an 'inspired by' Anna Wintour when you can have the real thing? Anyway, I'll be getting this on DVD to add to my expanding fashion-themed section. Who knew?"
Before Sunrise (1995),"Sweet and charming, funny and poignant, plot less but meaningful, ""Before Sunrise"" (1995), the third movie of Richard Linklater, is dedicated to everyone who ever been in love, is in love, or never been in love but still dreams of it and hopes to find it. It is one of the very rare movies that is/should/will be equally interesting to teenagers, their parents and even grandparents. It seems a very simple little movie with no spectacular visual effects, car chases, or long and steamy sex scenes. Two young people in their early 20s, two college students (American tourist Ethan Hawke who is returning home after the summer in Europe and the French student Julie Delpy who goes to Paris to attend the classes in Sorbonne) meet on a train. They are attracted to each other instantly even before they start talking, they hop off the train in Vienna where they walk around exploring the city all night. They talk and fall in love. That's it, that's the movie. It could've been boring and silly but instead, it is a lovely, believable, clever, and moving romance that only gets better with each viewing (at least, for this viewer). High praise and my sincere gratitude go to the director and writers for delivering two charming characters, superb writing, always interesting and witty dialogs, two awesome performances, and the atmosphere of magic that falling in love is. Julie Delpy, who looks like a Botticelli's angel, is great in portraying smart, independent, and incredibly attractive young woman."
Nobody's Fool (1994),"Paul Newman starred in many brilliant films of which he bizarrely wasn't nominated for an Oscar . He was nominated for Nobody's Fool but I have the feeling that was more of a sympathy or guilt nomination from the academy .

Don't get me wrong , his performance is good , It was probably his last good performance in fact, but the film itself is a bit too fluffy for me.

Paul Newman a stubborn man past his prime reflects on his life of strict independence and seeks more from himself.

He realises that he's not been a great father , in fact no father at all , so perhaps he can make up for that ?

Considering this was nominated twice for academy awards it's surprising how it feels like a Sunday afternoon made for TV film.

That's not a criticism, it just feels like that and lots of people like those type of films.

Newman plays this role very naturally and I was pleased he didn't try to make this comedic.

It has its serious moments and it's lighthearted moments and it's very watchable .

There is a great cast . Bruce Willis ( who chews up the scenery) , Melanie Griffith, who gives us a nice little flash ! , A young Phillip Seymour Hoffman and the last ever performance from Jessica Tandy , in fact she died before it was released.

All in all , it's not a bad film but it was never going to pull up any trees ."
Pushing Hands (1992),"This film is about an elderly Chinese man moving to America to join his son and family. He faces adjustment problems due to cultural clash.

The film is initially dull and boring. 7 minutes into the film and not one word is said! Though silence enhances the cultural rift between Mr Chu and Martha, the silence is probably too long. As the film progresses, more cultural differences are displayed. It is striking that during dinner, Martha and Jeremy uses forks to eat while Mr Chu and Alex uses chopsticks. Another striking scene is when Mr Chu and Mrs Chan talk in the community centre towards the end of the film, behind Mr Chu is an American flag while behind Mrs Chan it is a piece of Chinese calligraphy. Such subtle display of cultural differences is clever. The film is also heavy on Chinese traditional ideas, such as children taking care of parents as a natural duty, parents not wanting to burden children of their troubles etc. Such cultural ideas are beautifully explored.

It is a pity that this film is shot with a very low budget. There are even three occasions that the boom mike is visible. Fortunately, such imperfections do not hinder my enjoyment."
To Live  1994),"I saw this together with Red Lantern and viscerally knew which one I preferred right away. Having given it a few days to sit now, I see that Red Lantern has grown even more in my estimation while this has almost completely faded from view.

Lantern was precisely contained within narrative walls, it abstracted life by placing us in the midst of turning cycles of life and wove cloths out of that turning in the form of rituals that marked passage; color, sound, weather, architecture. It was akin to a Buddhist mandala to me, a cosmic picture directing me to find my own place in the center of things, choose repose over madness.

Zhang by contrast here wanders unconstrained, under the auspice of history, aiming for a full chronicle of sorts of Chinese life as a family moves through the decades. The stage backdrop changes frequently; Civil war, Great Leap, Cultural Revolution.

We do still have the turning of cycles and it does create a (cosmic) picture; a life of comfort squandered by the man's ignorance who loses it all, to one of hardship and quiet abiding. But eventually it doesn't direct towards a center that will illuminate the turn as something more than the ramblings of history.

And it's simply not a very enviable position to want to be the chronicler of history like Zhang is trying to here, it reminds me of how Kusturica stifled himself in similar endeavors. It means our reference point always has to be an externally agreed version of reality and we have to be chained to that sweep.

You can see him try to root himself in something more essential - the husband becomes a puppeteer putting on shadow plays for the people, life as the canvas where these evanescent shadow plays are enacted, now losing a fortune, now gaining back your family, so that we could see it from the distance of transient flickers of drama. Civil war is introduced as someone hacking down the screen, revealing war as another play that demands its actors assume their place.

But this is forgotten in lieu of stopping at various points of history so that it ends up being more the Oscar winning type than history parting to reveal myriad reflections like Andrei Rublev. Had it come out from the West, I'm sure it would have won a few and the wonderful Gong Li her first. The best I got out of it eventually was the sense of a man and woman trying to make their way together as the skies shift and the stage quakes by the ignorance of unseen puppet masters enacting their little plays. The Great Leap castigated as a wall collapsing on a little boy, because the man who crashed his car and the boy were both overworked and needed sleep.

Zhang took care to color history within certain lines so that we veer close to the monumental failures of the era but never quite see the full brunt of the horror, famine or mass persecution, only bits of abuse in passing. It was still banned by Party hacks anxious to control the play."
Dazed and Confused (1993),"Sometimes I write reviews and I can see people reading them, cursing my words and saying that I don't know what I'm on about. I'm well aware at how well Dazed and Confused was received, getting 5/5 ratings from the majority of viewers. I guess that means I just missed something about it and it didn't work for me.

It's about the last day of school in an American High School, back in 1976. The older students are looking forward to generally beating up the younger kids (as is tradition... apparently - all I can say is that this didn't happen to me at school in Britain during the eighties and nineties and I'm glad it didn't!).

I found most of the characters either unlikeable or boring. I found it hard to root for someone who enjoys bullying people smaller than them (which is most of the older kids), just as I found it harder to identify with the younger ones who just sort of spent most of the film running away or waiting to take a hiding. Plus there's no real story. What you have here is a collection of scenes with numerous different characters all doing their own things on the last day of school. There's also too many characters. Many don't really have much impact and aren't really fleshed out enough to be believed in. I think it would have benefited with a smaller cast. Although, the cast is pretty impressive - maybe not when this movie was made, but, in retrospect, there are a fair few Hollywood A-listers all here in the younger (pre-fame) days.

However, as much as I didn't really like it, I had to give it credit for getting the 'look' of the period right on. It really could have been filmed in the seventies for the way it was presented. Plus the soundtrack was right up my street. For once a film set in the seventies didn't have a single Abba track involved and there was far more use of some 'classic rock anthems' such as Alice Cooper (hooray!).

I didn't hate it, I just didn't like it as much as everyone else apparently did."
Naked (1993),"This movie is mesmerizing due to the following reasons :

. David Thewlis because he doesn't just give his greatest performance but because i don't think anyone fits for this role other than him . So Kudos to the casting members for carefully selecting this particular cast , it goes to other actors as well who did a great job in making a plotless story into one of the greatest movies in my opinion .

.The story is madly creative in terms of everything , where a lot of narrative devices are used to make it so . First of all , we don't know anything about the characters which make it amazing because you can always speculate especially when they are so interesting and as the story progresses we still are left in dark in weather we yet know anything about them . Especially Johnny an aimless drifter with no clear intention and obstacle to overcome other than himself and his words that he utters at each scene , like he is possessed by some kind of curse that only works if he wakes up . The only scenes where the movie is sort of quiet when he is asleep . Paying attention to small details like that makes this existential crisis themed journey more interesting . The movie deals mainly with the lengths with the way women must be treated .I've watched the movie numerous times but finally i am able to let it go because its so hypnotizing especially the soundtrack ."
Ruby in Paradise (1993),"Victor Nunez's 1993 film Ruby in Paradise is an insightful blend of romance, drama, and philosophy, that fondly reminds audiences that we are never alone in the journey to finding ourselves. Nunez's writing and direction is an honest and personal observation of the identity crisis we face when our dreams are halted by the stark realities of life. As we follow Ruby through her experiences in heartbreak, failure, and anxiety, we find a narrative that is comfortingly familiar to anyone's own life. Nunez does not reach for a fast-paced action, or otherworldly setting, but rather keeps us grounded in neighbor's pies and dead tourist shops, allowing a unique connection with the audience by not asking them to escape from the mundanity of their lives, but rather find gratitude in the simplicity of living. Ashley Judd's performance as Ruby is likeable, subtle, and earnest, giving prominence to intuitive acting. By simply existing within the scene, Judd elevates Nunez's writing to focus on the journey within rather than the consequences of big external events. Ruby in Paradise impresses by inviting a connection on a genuine human level not necessarily specific to gender or identity, making it worth revisiting 28 years later."
"Month by the Lake, A (1995)","Wonderful story... great acting.

If you love the Lake Como area of northern Italy this is for you. A special relationship develops between a man and a woman driven by something much deeper than the lust that permeates most of today's movie-making.

Edward Fox is simply magnificent and Ms. Redgrave is at her best. The tranquility of the time will amaze you. The world outside seems to be quickly falling apart as life goes on for the people in the film. If you want to enjoy a few moments of fun with a clever, delightful film this will be perfect.

The place in which they are staying does exist but not as a Hotel.

If you want to know why people like George Clooney fell in love with Lake Como, see this film.

It captured my wife and I from the very beginning.

Hollywood is rediscovering this region of Italy. (the Hotel in this movie is the place where Bond recovers from attack in Casino Royale and also part of a Stars movie)"
Funny Face (1957),"It's a flimsy intrigue, but the main characters make it a dream of perfect entertainment, beauty and romanticism. Fred Astaire was well advanced in his 50s when he made this film, and Audrey Hepburn was twenty years younger, and yet their peculiar romance works, although they make diametrically contrary characters, he a fast photographer for a fashion magazine and she a very intellectual librarian. But the question is if it is not Kay Thompson that makes this film. She was in very few films, and this one was her third and last major performance (in her 40s), and although she was not a real film star at all, she absolutely dominates the film. Although it's a very flimsy and superficial intrigue, the dialog is brilliant throughout, especially as Audrey all the time keeps spicing it with her philosophical conversation, which actually gets Kay Thompson intrigued in it was well, and it all turns out into some psychological education, as they all learn something about empathy - Audrey is the teacher, or rather the informer and awakener, while Fred and Kay never heard of such a thing before, but they do learn. To all this comes the marvellous old music of George Gershwin and the absolutely splendid direction by Stanley Donen. Every time I have seen this film (since 1958, the first time,) I have loved it even more, for its charm will keep growing with you and within you. It is all too obvious, and you can't miss it in the film, that Audrey Hepburn loved making this film with Fred Astaire, and she admitted that herself on TV decades afterwards. The imagination, the innovations, the variation of the performances and playacting, the intoxicatingly beautiful settings - everything combines in making this film one of the most precious jewels in all film musical history, and it will keep growing in its invaluable preciousness."
"Affair to Remember, An (1957)","I do love this film so and one thing it has that the original Love Affair did not have was that great title song, sung over the credits by Vic Damone. It was composed by Harry Warren and Harold Adamson and it's one of the great movie themes of all time. Guaranteed to put you in the mood for romance and tears.

This version with Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr sticks pretty close to the original with Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne. Two people, each engaged to others, meet on shipboard and fall in love. It's one of those chemical things that no one can help.

Grant's a playboy who candidly admits he's never worked a day in his life and Kerr wants a bit more security than that. They agree to meet at the top of the Empire State Building in exactly six months to see if the sparks are still there. But something is always interrupting the course of history and romance.

Can't say much more than that, but as Kerr reminds Grant if they don't meet it will be for a darn good reason and if you see the film you'll agree she had one.

This was the second of three films that Grant and Kerr made together and this is easily the best of them. I don't think Cary Grant was ever more romantic on the screen and that is saying something.

Cathleen Nesbitt though old enough to be his mother, plays Cary's grandmother in grand old world style. Her part had previously been played by Maria Ouspenskaya and later on in the Warren Beatty-Annette Bening remake was done by Katharine Hepburn.

If your taste run to screen romances, this is THE film you do not dare miss."
Hear My Song (1991),"I was charmed by more than the fact that I couldn't take my eyes off Tara Fitzgerald. A lovely whimsical plot, painting a picture of Irish fantasy, fairies and all, over the true life background of a great singer. And a beautiful soundtrack featuring original Locke recordings reminds us of just how moving a pure tenor voice can be. Who on earth needs techno and rap?

None of the other correspondents has yet picked up on the fact that Josef Locke (born Joseph McLaughlin 1917, died 1999) was alongside John McCormack as one of the two great Irish tenors (one correspondent has even written that he was a baritone -were you actually listening??) of the 20th century, and that he retired to rural life in Co Kildare in 1958 after the British Inland Revenue began to pursue him for large but disputed amounts of tax. That much is established fact, but this story of his comeback performance and the events surrounding it is indeed fantasy, with a happy feelgood ending. But what's so wrong with that? I like to be entertained, and unlike your more dismal correspondents I don't need to be intellectually challenged to thoroughly enjoy a movie. Nine out of ten, and I thought seriously about giving it ten as a gesture of eternal devotion to the stunningly beautiful Tara."
Mediterraneo (1991),"Incompetent Italian soldiers arrive on Greek island and learn to appreciate sex, dope, and football in the sun. That's it. Lots of scenes that you know are supposed to be funny, but they're just not.

If this film had been made in 1967, there might have been some excuse for the total lack of narrative interest. Having been made in 1991, it is unforgivable. The only decent thing in this film is the scenery. The plot, such as it is, is predictable and boring in the extreme. The male characters are all cardboard stereotypes, and the female characters are so thin as to be almost non-existent.

If you start watching it and you think it's maybe not that good, believe me it gets much worse.

It seems incredible that the same director went on to make ""Io non ho paura"" (""I am not afraid""), which is excellent. Just go straight to that, and forget this early mistake."
Passion Fish (1992),"John Sayles works so independently of the Hollywood mainstream and follows his own voice so meticulously that he often leaves his fans just a little short-changed with each successive work. As brilliant a filmmaker as he remains, every one of his films has its own shortcomings that leave it in the ""near-perfect"" category. In a way it feels as though he purposely leaves something unnecessary in each time out. For this reason among others, Sayles' films are an acquired taste. His 1992 film ""Passion Fish"" struts along at a very self-assured, yet slow paced gait, much like the population of its Southern Gothic location.

The main focus of the film is put on two women, one who returns to the place she left to dwell upon her current challenges and another who comes there for refuge from her troubles elsewhere. The women's paths intersect at a precarious point in their lives, leading to some very interesting results. Mary McDonnell stars as May-Alice, a feisty, soap actress forced into early retirement by a car accident. It's a challenging role and she brings a certain bravado that hasn't been shown by her previously. Alfre Woodard gives a highly nuanced performance as the nurse who has been hired to help the reluctant May-Alice.

Like in many of Sayles' films, given his immense prowess as a writer, the true pleasure comes not from watching the main storyline but the local and supporting flavor chewing up scenery throughout. One such gem involves an outdoor luncheon with McDonnell's character attempting to keep her composure and a tactful face with two Southern Belle types she hates. It's moments like this that add texture to Sayles' films, but also tend to keep them loosely edited and occasionally overwrought."
Fear (1996),"Well this is about as bad as movies get. Nothing to see here, move along. If you must know the threadbare plot follows 16-year old Nicole Walker, played by Reese Witherspoon. Sure is a long way from this garbage to an Academy Award for Miss Witherspoon. But I digress. Anyhow, young Nicole falls in love with seemingly sweet, nice, perfectly charming David McCall, played by Mark Wahlberg who somehow managed to salvage an acting career after appearing in this movie and thus was spared a lifetime of ""Whatever happened to that Marky Mark guy"" questions. Of course if David is as seemingly wonderful as he initially seems this movie would have a different title. As it is, David soon reveals himself to be a murderous lunatic and everybody does not in fact live happily ever after.

So what's wrong with this movie you ask? In a nutshell, everything. The script is terrible, with some of the most god-awful dialogue ever heard. The characters are all clichéd, pulled straight out of so many similar and infinitely better movies that had come before. This film has nothing new to offer, it's just a painfully bad rehash. It's meant to be suspenseful and shocking. In fact it's just laughable. Nothing here is believable, the whole thing is over to the top to the point of stupidity. Don't even get me started on why Nicole's completely ordinary family lives in a home with more security features than Fort Knox. It's downright ludicrous, an artificial attempt to make the climax of the film more dramatic. Unfortunately by the film's climax you'll be stifling yawns. If you haven't already given up and turned the thing off. You get the sense everyone involved with this movie would like to forget it ever happened. If you ever are unlucky enough to have to sit through it you'll wish you could forget it too."
Heaven's Prisoners (1996),"Dave (Alec Baldwin) is an ex-New Orleans homicide detective and recovering alcoholic , living a quiet life on a bayou with patient wife (Kelly Lynch) . They witness a plane crash and Dave rescues the only survivor , a young Savadoran girl , whom they adopt . But the crash was not an accident and Dave's snooping around involves him with drug runners and local crime bosses including old high school buddy , Bubba (Eric Roberts) and his sirenish wife Claudette (Teri Hatcher) . For an ex-cop obsessed with an unsolved murder, trusting the wrong woman could be a deadly choice !

A crime thriller with action-packed , intrigue , fights , shootouts , chases and beautiful exteriors . Based on the mystery series by James Lee Burke ; in fact , Alec Baldwin was hoping to go back the Dave Robicheaux character written by Burke in a sequel to be called ""Dixie City Jam"", then New Line Cinema released the film at the start of the US summer season, hoping it would be a good counter-programmer to other blockbusters, resulting in a flop at the box office , due to failed ¨Heaven's prisoners¨ led to the follow-up being scrapped . Convoluted plot with some moody touches but Alec Baldwin scores as the flawed , out-of-luck ex-homicide detective . As Alec Baldwin is nice as hardened New Orleans cop, who finally tosses in the badge and settles into life on the bayou with his wife finely played by Kelly Lynch . While the attractive Mary Stuat Masterson is his old flame, a blond stripper who still has feelings for Dave. Furthermore , fine acting from Eric Robert as as drug lord Bubba Rocque, Dave's childhood friend and his sex-hungry, explosive wife nicely played by Teri Hatcher . Along with a long plethora of secondaries , such as : Vondie Curtis Hall , Badja Djola , Joe Viterelli in his usual role as mobster and special apperaence of Paul Guifoyle of CSI as a police inspector .

Probably one of the best parts of the film results to be the New Orleans locations , including White Castle, Louisiana, (Nottoway Plantation) well photographed by cameraman Harris Savides . As well as an evocative and sensitive musical score by great composer George Fenton. The motion picture was professionally directed by Phil Joanou , but it quickly faded from screens after being steamrolled by other big releases. The film was then slated for a 1995 release by the studio, but was finally shelved again because Savoy Pictures had folded in bankruptcy , then Savoy were picked up by other studios, in fact ¨Heaven's prisoners¨ was completed and produced two years before its actual release and New Line Cinema eventually released the film in the spring of 1996 . Phil Joanou was hired by Alec Baldwin, in his role as executive producer who approached Phil Joanou to direct the film based on the suggestion of his then-wife, Kim Basinger, who'd had a good time working with Joanou on Final Analysis (1992) . Phil Joanou is an uneven director (Gridiron gang, Heaven's prisoners , Final analysis) with hits and flops and filmmaker of video-clips and films for U2 (Rattle and hum). As ""Final Analysis"" and ""Heaven's Prisoners"" proved to be critical and financial disappointments , Spielberg and Bono of U2 (separately) encouraged Joanou to ""write something personal"" and ""from the heart"", resulting in the extensively autobiographical ""Entropy"". In addition , Spielberg gave Joanou the screenplay for Three O'Clock High (1987), then known as ""After School"" and subsequently directing the notable ¨State of Grace¨with a great cast as Sean Penn , Ed Harris , Gary Oldman , among others . Rating : 6/10. Acceptable and passable. The flick will appeal to alec Baldwin fans."
Blood & Wine (1997),"You would think the tandem of the glorious Michael Caine, the always stunning Jack Nicholson and the adorable Judy Davis would set a movie's heels on fire but ""Blood and Wine"" falls far from expectations as the sparks never start on set.

All these esteemed actors give a good showing in their own right but their characters are flat and lifeless. The script seems compelled only to move the action along and nothing else. Mr. Caine, Mr. Nicholson and Ms. Davis give punctuation and try their best to put a breath of life into this lifeless film with an all too obvious plot.

Stephen Dorff gives a better performance than usual (no cheers for Blade or Cecil B. Demented) but his character is far from complex, and Jennifer Lopez can't keep her faux Cuban accent up throughout the course of the film.

The plot is rather generic and the suspense that the movie is trying to portray is better invoked by the musical score than the cinematic or script climax.

As a saving grace the location scouting is great, really espousing the feeling of the Floridian backdrop. But that doesn't save the movie. There are as well a couple of slightly memorable stunt scenes but is not an action film.

Skip this one and watch Chinatown again. And if you haven't seen that see it twice."
Turbulence (1997),"Turbulence, it's such a stupid, pointless movie. The aircraft, a Trans Con 747-200, has the controls of a 747-400. This is a 747-200! not a 747-400. The cockpit should have gouges, switches, and a flight engineer station, rather than having computers. How can a 747 have very little passengers on a holiday? Why would the police transport a convict on a civilian airliner? I thought that convicts should be transported on a Boeing 727 (like the one they used in the film Eraser and U.S. Marshals) rather than a Boeing 747, unless there are more than 300 convicts. Why would the autopilot kill the pilot? Pretty stupid invention. I tested what would happened if a Boeing 747-200 would do if flies upside down on Flight Simulator ( by Microsoft not the real one). The 747 would lose a lot of altitude instead of flying at leveled altitude, And there is no way a 747 would have an outside viewing window in the avionics bay. Neither does it have a sliding door on the staircase to block access to the upper deck. The staircase of a 747-200 is not suppose to be straight it's suppose to be spiral styled. Even the Tower Air 747 ( the aircraft that Capt. Bowen flies while helping Teri to fly the plane ) has the same stuff like the Trans Con 747. Most of the scenes in Turbulence has been placed in films like, Turbulence 2 and 3 and Ground Control. Turbulence 2 and 3 all have something in common, and that is their destination is always LAX. I really don't like this film, but I like to keep on watching it whenever there is nothing to watch on TV."
"Beautician and the Beast, The (1997)","First of all, I'll let everyone know that I gave this movie (worthy of a 7) a 10 just because the overall rating deserves to be A LOT higher than it is! Secondly, everyone who gave this movie a bad rating needs to stop rating movies altogether. What's not to like about this movie that is charming, cute, innocent, and funny?? Fran Drescher may have been type-casted right off the Nanny, but who cares!!???!! What did you expect her to act like in the film!?! Were you expecting an oscar worthy performance!!!??? Did you think she was the next Gwyneth Paltrow, or Julianne Moore??? If you saw the previews and have half a brain, you would have known exactly what to expect. I had no expectations for this movie (nor should anyone have) besides a good laugh. And that's exactly what it delivers. Fran is absolutely perfect for the role of Joy Miller and she is even more charming and funny in this movie than Sandra Bullock is in Miss Congeniality (another great movie by all accounts, and I'm not downing the always fantastic Sandra). You people need to STOP ANALYZING MOVIES FOR WHAT THEY'RE NOT AND LEARN TO ENJOY THEM FOR WHAT THEY ARE!!!!!!!!"
Cats Don't Dance (1997),"In 1997, Warner Bros. and Ted Turner released an animated musical feature called Cats Don't Dance, which was intended as a tribute to Hollywood musicals from the 1930s. With direction from Mark Dindal (who would go on to make The Emperor's New Groove) and some choreography taught by the legend himself, Gene Kelly, this seemed like a sure fire hit....that is if it really were. While the film was decently well received by critics, it wasn't marketed very well and sadly flopped at the box office. Luckily, it has garnished a cult following over the years, and after seeing it myself, I can more than ever see why.

Set in Hollywood in the late 1930s, the film centers around the optimistic and talented cat Danny who wants to make it into showbiz. The only issue, he's a cat and all other animals are only treated as second rate props behind human actors, including the nasty Darla Dimple. Upon getting into trouble with Ms. Dimple, Danny decides to bring all the animals together to make it big in the movies. Yeah, right off the bat, the plot is rather predictable and it's not so different from the usual underdog story we normally see in some animated movies. That being said, the film makes up for the weak plot with some highly entertaining scenes and jokes, fast paced animation, likable characters, and a true passion for Hollywood.

In terms of the characters, Danny is the highly ambitious albeit naive protagonist who wishes to be a star, even if he has to fight hard to get his dream, which is something many people still go through today so he is a little sympathetic. Sawyer is the disillusioned albeit beautiful white cat who neglects Danny's hopes at first, but soon supports him and the other animals to become big as well. Also, can I just say that Danny and Sawyer are absolutely adorable? I love cats as it is, but they are so charming and delightful to watch....anyway, the rest are rather one dimensional, but are still humorous in their own right, like the giddy Tillie, the bad tempered curmudgeon Cranston, the superstitious T.W., and the chubby albeit charming Pudge.

And then there's Darla Dimple, who is absolutely hilarious from her voice to her design. As she is a parody of Shirley Temple, she may seem like an adorable animal loving angel, but she's really an egotistical monster who will do whatever it takes to sabotage the animals just so she can be the big shot. In addition, her butler Max just cracks me up almost every time, mainly from how huge and deadpan he is. Speaking of Darla's prejudice of animals, the most interesting thing about the story itself is how, as stated before, the animals are viewed. Many of the animals themselves have dreams to be big in the theater, but they're sadly looked down upon by the humans who top them. If not for the fact that they were animals, this film probably could have been a social commentary on how African Americans were mistreated in showbiz until the 1960s....damn, this film is smart.

As for the animation, in accordance to the film's upbeat and whimsical tone, the general style is reminiscent to the Looney Tunes and cartoons by Tex Avery. The characters are designed from the ground up to be cartoony, and their fast paced squash & stretch movements are perfectly timed. Not to mention, given how Gene Kelly did some choreography for the animators, the dance moves are superb, really bringing out a lot of jive and soul from each animal. The way the movie recreates Hollywood is solid enough, but the dance movements bring out that extra flavor of fun for the audience. It's also cool how the film utilizes a perfectly contrasted color scheme to set the tone: saturated when optimistic and happy and neutralized when sad and hopeless.

Now I will admit, the musical numbers done by Randy Newman are rather hit or miss. Some like I Do Believe, Danny's Arrival Song and Tell Me Lies do come at their given times and are well directed and choreographed, but they don't leave enough impact to be memorable enough to sing along to. That being said, others like Animal Jam, Big and Loud, and especially Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now are highly entertaining, catchy and worth getting off your seat and just dancing to. The last one mentioned is a special highlight, not just because of the shenanigans Darla Dimple gets herself into, but also by the jazzy and upbeat tone that stands as a true finale highlight, complete with solid colors, lyrics, and dances. So yeah, the songs are either average or very good, but the good ones stick out more.

I don't know how this film would have gone had it been marketed properly, but I do know that it would have been somewhat of a classic. Cats Don't Dance is a highly entertaining and fun feature that stands as an enjoyable tribute and rendition to musicals from Hollywood's golden era. Even if the plot is fairly standard and most of the characters aren't particularly grand, the wacky fast paced animation, lovable main protagonists and antagonists, catchy songs, and comedic tone make it an enjoyable feature worth your time. If you're a fan of Hollywood movies from the 30s and 40s, musicals, animated features with talking animals, or even cartoony animation, then definitely seek this one out for the whole family. Give this film as much love and support as it needs, and make it big and loud (wink wink)."
Head Above Water (1996),"Superior court judge George (Harvey Keitel) sentenced Nathalie (Cameron Diaz) to two years probation and then married her. She's happy and brings him to her family's summer island home. Her childhood friend Lance (Craig Sheffer) is the caretaker living in a cabin. Lance takes George on an overnight fishing trip. Nathalie is alone and her ex-boyfriend Kent (Billy Zane) shows up. His girlfriend left him and they spend the day drinking together. The next morning, she wakes up on the couch with the boat coming back. Kent however is dead and naked in the bed. She decides to hide the body and screwball wackiness ensues.

I'm not sure why Nathalie has to hide Kent. I'm even less sure why George has to hide Kent. It may be embarrassing but they could have dressed him up and call the cops. He wasn't even there when Kent died. The broken neck is post-mortem. All the moving the dead body around is kind of pointless and is reminiscent of 'Weekend at Bernie's'. They keep making things worst and worst for no good reason. I keep thinking there has to be better ways to do this.

The comedic tone doesn't make it funny. This could have been much better darker. It could be Hitchcockian with some better writing. I don't think the screwball comedy works at all. However a dark psychological thriller could work."
Hercules (1997),"In the grand Disney tradition of making free with literature and history to create an irresistibly entertaining movie experience, we have the lively ""Hercules"". Rendering the Olympian pantheon in rainbow hues is certain to please children, where austere white draperies and beige complexions have long been the norm onscreen. The whole is set in modern terms easily absorbed by the contemporary American audience-- it's fun!

One hopes that the younger set might be inspired to investigate the real mythology as recorded, and not assume they'd been adequately instructed in the subject by this highly revised version. Of course 'real' is relative, since any mythology deals with miraculous events that are not supported by the historic record. A good deal of Judeo-Christian biblical text falls under this designation; it must be taken on faith. But Judeo-Christian scriptures belong to active religions, and thus the events described are literally sacred. The religion of the ancient Greeks cannot be described as active, and thus is fair game for irreverent revisions that will offend very few beside Hellenist scholars.

Animated and live-action films that illustrate current religions, however, must adhere to tradition. Only look at the wealth of Hindu devotional films, visualized scriptures that provide ample evidence of the present-day believer's faith in the miraculous. Animated versions make these treasured tales of the gods more accessible to children. This is a living religion, with about a billion followers worldwide, and the third largest faith today.

But a 'dead' religion has virtually no one to protect its integrity, and so its miracles become myths, and its myths become infinitely flexible.

I suppose it's best for the tender sensibilities of children to present Zeus as a nice monogamous papa-god, whose only son was borne by his wife Hera. Later on his many outrageous infidelities, committed in various interesting disguises, can be revealed. They're certainly entertaining! And so is the Disney ""Hercules""."
Stuart Saves His Family (1995),"Movies inspired by SNL characters seem to have a consistently bad reputation. But that reputation is usually based on the fact that the films failed at the box office. The truth is, they are good solid comedies that were never meant to be blockbusters. 'Stuart Saves His Family' is just such a film.

This film has a cast of excellent actors who portray tragedy and comedy with sublime skill. The script is heartfelt and funny. There is no mockery of recovery programs or the self-help movement. Instead, 'Stuart Saves His Family' evokes the all too real humor amid the tragedy that comes from being part of a dysfunctional family (and world).

AL Franken's deadpan deliver of Stuart's ridiculous, but charming self is the the heart of the movie. But equally good are Piper Laurie, Vincent D'Onofrio, Lesley Boone & Harris Yulin. All four play characters who could easily descend into shrill, two-dimensional background support to the wacky lead character. Thankfully, the actors all bring out the human beings inside their characters.

The message about finding your own definition of happiness and family is another of the movie's strong points.

I also recommend ""Superstar"", another SNL character driven movie, starring Molly Shannon. She's an excellent actress with a wicked, silly streak."
Cabin Boy (1994),"I loved it, and it's crazy, since I'm not a Chris Elliott's fan at all!

I believe the best thing about this movie is that it doesn't allege some things that it doesn't have, or bigger than it already owns.

It's solid simple fun. The naive atmosphere worked perfectly. The idiot gags looked smart. Sometimes, it's the most cynical kids' fantasy. Sometimes, it's a close spoof of (Jason and The Argonauts - 1963). And all the time, it's some fine comics.

Surprisingly, (Melora Walters) looked super cute. The sailors' team delivered so right performance. Nothing was over the top, or goofy in a bad way. All the elements harmonized to make the jest good. It even managed to be a story about a boy turning into a man along the way too.

This kind of comedies used to be twisted, disgusting, poor, or easy, whatever. But Cabin Boy isn't any of that. It's joyful, yet in loyally childish way; which can be the secret of it indeed.

Unlike so many jests, this will live long."
"Stupids, The (1996)","Pathetic attempt to imitate the likes of Inspector Clusseau, Curley (3 Stooges), and Agent Maxwell Smart. These classic slapstick characters bumbled their ways into our hearts with expert comedic timing. Tom Arnold just bumbles aimlessly through this movie devoid of laughs. Stanley Stupid (Arnold), patriarch of the Stupid family, suspects there's an evil scheme to steal garbage, and he's suspicious of ""Return to Sender"" mail. Are you rolling on the floor weak with laughter yet?

Me neither.

Overdone stereotypes, feeble attempts to strain humor from gags that don't work, poorly executed slapstick, a script that laughs at its own jokes while nobody else does, an immaterial story that's nothing more than a vehicle for one banal scene after another, gratuitously violent events that are tossed out at you as humor; the list goes on. I always thought the song ""I'm my own Grandpa"" was clever--Arnold just makes it annoying. Few movies are more excruciatingly painful to endure than failed and unfunny comedies: this is one of these.

If somebody was stealing garbage, why didn't they steal this?"
"Pest, The (1997)","I actually joined this site simply to write in about this movie. I was sitting in my living room and this movie came on one of the local channels. I made it about an hour through before I simply had enough. Curious to see what the general movie-opinionated public thought of this movie, I looked it up on this site. I was absolutely shocked to see that there were an overwhelming amount of people that thought it was great. I needed to have my say, and here it is: This movie is absolute garbage. It was a chore to sit through. The ""jokes"" were uninspired rehashes from other, better shows and movies, and Leguizamo's manic portrayal of this obnoxious character should only appeal to age ten and below. That actually may be a stretch even for that age. I'm all for slapstick ridiculousness, but there isn't even the faintest hint of wit or cleverness. I have an idea, lets take bad uninspired obvious jokes and play them at twice the speed. Now that's funny. Ha. Ha.

Movies that you should see that take silly humor and add comic timing and originality: The Marx Brothers' A Night at the Opera, Monty Python's The Meaning of Life, South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut,...and the list goes on. Don't lose an hour and a half of your life on unmemorable crap.

By the way, I can only assume that the reason that David Bar Katz (the other writer) did VERY little in film after this movie is because he was instantly blacklisted. I'm actually impressed that Leguizamo was able to recover after this mess."
Geronimo: An American Legend (1993),"From the 80's onwards, movies and television stories have introduced us to many heroic individuals living during the late 1800s with amazingly modern attitudes towards Native Americans. I'm starting to wonder how the hostiles were designated ""hostile"" when there were so many of these stand-up-and-be-heard PC types running around. (In the army, no less, which is just the place *I* would go if I wanted to find to a peaceful solution with the native American people.) I do wish that the movies would just show what happened without the characters of Basil Exposition and The Preacher, so we can form our own conclusions.

This movie is no exception, focusing on the Apache War, with Jason Patric playing Lt. Gatewood - speaking the very language of the Apache - pointing out to his commanding officer the errors of Indian policy. Matt Daman trots along in his wake and explains other concerns helpfully. Both look sincere and concerned, with Jason showing religious fervor and Matt looking terribly naive. Robert Duvall is excellent (as always); Wes Studi is solid as Geronimo.

The scenery (if you neglect to note the transportation implications as they race from one lovely monument several hours by car to another while raiding in the space of minutes) is lovely, and the soldiers look suitably tired and scruffy. I did find it dreadfully distracting (sorry to be so obsessive) that each actor had a mouthful of beautiful white teeth in the 1800s when dental care was a mere rumour.

And the facts. Well, so, as one reviewer pointed out, we weren't there, but we do know some details because the people that were there kept diaries and wrote letters, and we can compare what people wrote, and they all agreed on certain things. Unfortunately, Hollywood used what was handy and ignored a few important details.

So now some viewers will probably think they know something about Geronimo's life that isn't true, especially the poor junior high school kid cheating on some report by watching the movie. It's just irresponsible for movie makers to distort basic and important facts for the sake of the story.

This movie was beautifully photographed, well acted, and brings visibility in an highly poignant fashion to the suffering of the Native American to those who may have missed all the other movies. If they'd ridden their horses just a little closer to the facts, they would have had a much tighter story on Geronimo."
"Double vie de Véronique, La  1991)","This is a film which defies explanation. The story, on the one hand is quite simple in concept. There is a linking force between two women who live countries apart yet somehow have a sense of the other, even a love and kinship with each other. The one of them seems ignorant of it until that link is severed, at which point she sets about trying to understand the link she has lost.

Truly, what sets apart the film is not the unique concept (though it is fascinating) but, rather, the way Kieslowski tells the story through dreamlike remembrances, refractory light and reflection, beautifully haunting and lifting music, and a performance from Irene Jacob which must have been a combined effort between her and the director.

Beginning with the latter, I have to say that there is something odd yet wonderful about Irene Jacob's (""Au Revoir les Enfants"") performance as both Veronique and Weronica. Avoiding voice over to add interior monologue is a challenge. When you are working with an actress who performs as brilliantly as Jacob the answer is acting. At almost no point in the film are you left wondering what she feels or what she is thinking. Her face says it all. Her body language punches it home.

Hers is a face which can shine forth with innocence, passionate desire, heart-heaviness, soul rending grief, and exuberant joy, even as she astounds with singing performances which carry away the audience. She really is what makes this film work. Without her there is nothing here to watch.

This understanding that what the audience connects to is through what they see and experience through the film allows Kieslowski to create a true work of art. Like The Mona Lisa, theories abound as to what he meant by it but ultimately he has left it up to us viewers to find meaning within.

Many have said that they see religious allegory. Others see supernatural connection of spirit between people or even reincarnation. For me, There are some key scenes that lead me to believe that it is, at least in part, about generational knowledge and human collective consciousness.

In many ways it seems that Veronique learns from the experiences that her counterpart Weronica has had even when she is totally unaware of the connection. She has a sense of what she should do in any given moment or situation, despite never having had a similar experience. She just knows what is the right thing to do.

This theory of mine is furthered by the presence of both girls' fathers and their interesting relationships with them. The one seems far closer than the other but is that because she has learned from the other's mistakes or because we must all learn the balance between a past generations knowledge and our own self knowledge.

In ways, I think this film encourages us to find a balance between the two, realizing that we are more than just ourselves or even the various possible paths we could take through life. We are communal beings who live amongst others, not just in our physical environments, work, school, and home, but also in our spirits, minds, and hearts.

The film provokes one to rumination and thought, to be sure. I am confident that while another person may see ""The Double Life of Veronique"" and see something completely different within it, they will see something which captures their heart and wakens their spirit as only great art is able to do."
Until the End of the World  1991),"I agree with the comments made earlier concerning the denouement but that's only a disappointment if you look at the movie literally instead of figuratively. As in his other movies like Paris, Texas, the backdrops become another character in the film. Just like the title entails, Wenders was challenged to get the WHOLE world into his movie. He has succeeded. At the end of ""The End of The World"", we finally see it as we should all see the Earth.

The characters represent different ideologies of the different countries they're from and Wenders uses this to develop the plot.

These ""countries"" are trying to seize control of one man's vision and a source of power. However, they soon find out that not one of them can control the outcome of the movie.

The movie is Wender's commentary on global politics and socioeconomics. He portrays the world in a flurry of action from a European car chase to a U.S.A in recession, to a dichotomized Japan, and to an isolated Australia. It is an accurate depiction of the world we are living in now because that is how the movie was filmed - out in the streets of the real world circa the end of the 20th century which enhances the theme of the movie.

If you watch this movie you will believe you are living at ""The End of the World"". The movie is even better NOW then when it first came out. It's been 13 years since the first showing and I'm 28. Being a teenager, the sci-fi, action, fast-pace and the heroine's romance with William Hurt held my attention but to truly appreciate the WHOLE MOVIE you have to get past the juvenile/pop culture themes.

Being a woman, I identified with the heroine and the way she acts at the end of the movie and I think you will, too. The men will relate to the narrator because they tend to distance themselves from what's really going on in this movie and ""cut to the chase"". Overall, the movie is good for the whole family to watch except for one nude scene.

This ""summary"" took me awhile to write but as I went through the process of analyzing the movie from memory it became easier and easier as the film's key scenes flashed into my head. This only proves how powerful and clear Wenders' vision is as a director."
Waiting for Guffman (1996),"Christopher Guest has the knack for creating films where genuine laughter never stops. We saw this film when it was originally released, but caught it recently in the retrospect of Mr. Guest's films shown recently here.

""Waiting for Guffman"" is, to this humble viewer, probably his best creation to date. Not only is this a funny movie, it shows the genius of Mr. Guest at his best.

Corky St. Clair, the director from the New York stage seems completely out of place in Blaine, Mo. He is too witty for that small little town, where he is clearly adored, not only by the local thespians, but by the whole municipal council. Some of the lines one hears coming from Corky's mouth are so amazing that one wonders if the citizens of Blaine fully realize they have a gem living in town.

The players auditioning for Corky's new production about Blaine's beginnings, live in a world of themselves. Ron and Sheila Albertson, are the star of other productions, so they return again for the new show. Libby Mae Brown works in the Dairy Queen, but her ambition is to be a star. Even the local dentist, Dr. Allan Pearl, is attracted to become a performer.

There are two other underlying plots going on in the film. There is the history part, or how Blaine came to be, and the other notorious incident of the flying saucer that came into town and took several of the citizens for a tour of the space craft and we are being told about it by the people that experienced that adventure.

Christopher Guest makes a wonderful Corky St. Clair. Mr. Guest knows what makes Corky great. Corky, no doubt, is a composite of people Mr. Guest must have known at one time or another. Corky is an enormous achievement for Mr. Guest as a writer and as a performer.

Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara are incredible in their take of the Albertsons, the travel agents without a clue of what's going on outside Blaine. Ron's delicate operation is explained in some detail to the horrified Mrs. Pearl. Eugene Levy, Mr. Guest's frequent collaborator is right on the money as the dentist with singing aspirations. Parker Posey, is the girl who thinks Broadway is only a few steps away. Paul Dooley, Don Lake, Larry Miller,Linda Kash, are among the citizens of Blaine one gets to know in the film.

Of course, none of this would have been possible without Christopher Guest. It's a shame we don't get to see more of him, but that makes even better whatever he decides to offer us from time to time."
I Shot Andy Warhol (1996),"A movie that takes on topics as prone to controversy as the art of Andy Warhol and radical feminism is almost sure to garner itself with with passionate fans and spiteful critics alike. Because it portrays its subject matter with such skill, one's opinion on the film likely says something about one's ideas on those matters, and setting aside these opinions will probably yield a much more moderate take on the film. At least it does for me.

Now: as a presentation of the events that led to Warhol's shooting, this film was brilliant. Its portrayal of Solanas's and Warhol's motivations and ideas is done with compassion and clarity; I particularly enjoyed its characterization of Warhol, which, in my opinion, was quite complimentary, contrary to some other opinions expressed on this board. He approaches things with an endearingly childlike innocence, a willingness to accept anything as beautiful... Well, some people might not find that complimentary... Nonetheless, it is his hangers on who come across as cruel and unpleasant. And of course, Lili Taylor plays the idiosyncratic Solanas marvelously.

Unfortunately, the focus on the context of the events causes the film to suffer as a narrative. Many of the mood generating scenes, while providing considerable insight into the characters, seem directionless and unsure. This would not be a problem had they been more visually or emotionally compelling, but as it is, they are only occasionally composed as anything other than simple, plot-furthering shots. The result is that the film seems digressive and unfocused, and this digression mars what could have been a fascinating film.

In the end, though, this is certainly a film worth watching, if you're willing to pay attention, especially when one of its more striking images comes to the surface."
Stealing Beauty (1996),"1st watched 10/15/2005, 9 out of 10(Dir-Bernardo Bertolucci): Marvelous coming-of-age story about a young woman named Lucy(played by Liv Tyler), returning to a place where her deceased mother spent a lot of time and rejuvenates some of the relationships she had four years prior while her mother was still alive. Bernardo Bertolucci again masterfully weaves this story in his usual poetically-visual style of directing. You feel like he's given everything he has and more to tell this story. It's told mainly from the main character's point of view, which is amazing in itself, but is possibly why the screenplay was written by a woman, Susan Minot. The story begins as Lucy arrives at her destination with a diary of her late mother's in hand. She reads thru this as a means to get to know her mother better(we get the feeling that she was not as close to her as she would have liked to be). The trip is also a way to explore this by getting to know her from the people who were close to her. The trip was the gift from her father, whom she has never met, and thus begins another search for her. Her virginity is also a hot topic, but mostly from those around her. She had only kissed a boy five years prior when she visited before and is still infatuated with him and hopes he will be the one(if you know what I mean). Since her mother's death she has closed herself up in many ways, and this has been one of them(although she denies this). Every character in this story is full of life in one way or another and seems to know their place in it except Lucy. And that's basically what this story is about. Her self discovery and her finding her place in the history of her family. The Italian landscape provides breathtaking views that Bertolucci takes great advantage of, the modern music blended with classical makes for an awesome soundtrack, and of course the storytelling plays it's way to a wonderful ending that leaves you again wanting to know these people more and more. This is where Bertolucci succeeds so well. His characters are rich and full of stories like real people who are merely here to enjoy their life. What a concept and what a film from a masterful director!!"
Basquiat (1996),"Georgia O'Keefe, the doyenne of American art once said: ""I don't know what art is, but I know what is art when I see it"".

Julian Schnabel, a New York based painter, turned film director, decided to make Jean Michel Basquiat the subject of his first time at the helm in the new role. The result is a film that shows us a young artist in search of an identity when he was breaking as a painter.

Jean Michel Basquiat was a success story, as far as his art was concerned. He clearly became a big force in the New York art scene. We watch him as he goes from a struggling young man to the success he became, and ultimately killed him. Some people can cope with fame and wealth, but others, like Jean Michel couldn't. History is full of cases like this one troubled young man who died too soon.

As far as Basquiat's art, well, that's in the eye of whoever is seeing it. Some will say it was trash, while others, like it seems to be the case with the director, tells us otherwise. Some of his pieces are overwhelming in their intensity.

The only reason for watching this film is Jeffrey Wright, an actor's actor. Mr. Wright is seen almost sleepwalking through the film. He seems to be on a permanent fog, as he didn't relate too well to all the hangers-on of that world. David Bowie as Andy Warhol made a tremendous impression. Benicio del Toro is only seen briefly. The rest of the cast do whatever they can under the unsure direction of Mr. Schnabel."
2 Days in the Valley (1996),"Each time I watch 'Two Days in the Valley' I like it less.

It's a knock-off of many films of The Nineties, its closest 'relative'; being Pulp Fiction. A bunch of characters, a seemingly disparate group of stories, all coming together for a grand finale. When I first saw it I thought, How modern. I thought, Brilliant plotting. Now I see it and think, Contrived. Very contrived. As for the characters, they're just too broad, too stereotypical. In fact I had the sense that the film-makers (Director, Screenwriters) were quite in love with themselves; their cleverness, their cynicism.

Here's the story. An athlete is murdered. One of the two murderers tries to kill the other murderer, but fails. The two murders go their separate ways, meet different people many of whom have some a vague relationship to one another. Of course the two murderers will meet again, each bringing with him the people they've been with. And this forms the grand finale in which someone's gotta die. And does.

James Spader is terrific as Murderer #1.

Likewise Danny Aiello as Murderer #2.

Glenn Headley is impossible not to love as the assistant to a no-good Hollywood-type.

Paul Mazursky steals the show as a down-and-out suicidal former film director with a great little dog.

Terry Hatcher is fine as the dead athlete's girlfriend who may be harboring an important secret regarding the murder. And this was a problem for me, an inconsistency in the plot. If she is involved with the murder, then scenes of her first reaction to the murder are .... 'off'.

Charlize Theron as girlfriend to Murderer #1 is also fine, but nowhere near as good as she's gonna be over the following decades.

Overall, it's OK. Only just. On my latest viewing I had the sense that it was meant to be a longer film but, at the last minute, was edited down. I say this as the pace - early-on it's quite slow - seems to pick up as we approach the ninety minute mark; the bringing together of all the characters seems a large, hastily concocted, device.

But maybe it's that I've seen it too many times.

Watch it yourself. See if you agree."
Private Parts (1997),"Pathetic attempt by radio shock jock Howard Stern to redeem his extremely negative image after utterly offending everyone and everything in the planet, and self-proclaiming ""king of all media"" (laugh). The whole point of the movie is to display Mr. Stern as a loving family man whose sense of humor is just misunderstood by the general American public.

It's not a bad movie, very funny at times, and shows a lot of care in the writing of the script. The sad part is that Mr. ""family man"" Stern still makes horrendous, tasteless jokes on his radio show, and just recently he aired some perversely disgraceful ""jokes"" (for lack of a better name) about the female victims of the Columbine high school shooting.

This movie did not change my view of Howard Stern; I still don't see him as a misunderstood, caring family man. He still is mean and tasteless in his radio show, and keeps pushing the limits of what's even ethical or responsible to broadcast."
Anaconda (1997),"This is not as bad as some people say it is. Generally, it's pretty formulaic, but there are a few alterations on the monster movie format.

A crew making a documentary set sail down a tropical river, on their way losing their fuel and, you guessed it, bumping into a big snake. There are all the usual characters here: beautiful girl, villain, posh English bloke (there's always one!), working-class hero, etc. They gradually get picked off one-by-one - although guessing the next ""victim"" is so easy, it takes the fun out of it all.

There are a few oddities in the consistency of the plot. Most of the killing happen in the second half of the film with the first half devoted to boring sub-plots. Curiously, the customary ""introduction shock"" is not a snake death, but a suicide. We never really find out why this has happened - after all, there is still a lot of Jennifer Lopez to be shown - and this, I think, is one of the main problems with the film. Story lines are attempted but never completed and so the audience will never gain true satisfaction from the film.

Another interesting factor is Terri's boyfriend and his contribution to the story line. During a dive, he gets bitten and the crew manage to recover him. They save his life but he is still unconscious and remains so throughout most of the movie.

However, the weakest character of all is the snake. Sure, it's pretty ugly, but it will never be truly terrifying as the director doesn't play on our sense of fear. We may be surprised when the snake attacks but never truly shocked.

As I said before, this isn't too bad a movie (I've seen worse) - there are some moments of tension, the actors do their jobs and the special effects are far from laughable. You might want to watch this if it's shown of TV, but I wouldn't pay money to see it."
Romy and Michele's High School Reunion (1997),"Unpretentious exhilarant sexy comedy starring the hottest Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow, this charming movie is really great, they play a dumb unmarried girls around thirty from Tucson, sharing a small apartment at Los Angeles for ten years, also they suffer of inferiority complex due weren't a successful girls henceforth, Romy (Mira Sorvino) is a simply cashier meanwhile Michele (Lisa Kudrow) is temporarity unemployed, now they are invited to class reunion at Tucson, sadly no good memories from that period of time, actually they were rejected by a self-called A-team, a foursome of snobbish pretty girls, in other hand Romy still was in love by his classmate, they are wondering, how go back at your hometown being two unmarried girls as loser, then came up the stupid idea to embody themselves as well-heeled businesswomen, rocked by a sugary soundtrack it sounds really fresh conceptive comedy, artsy and smart, Mira Sorvino is prettier in between Lisa Kudrow is sexier with those beautiful legs & hearty breasts letting me crack up along the picture, pleasant experience mainly on Blu-ray!!

Shiloh (1997),"We all have those classic movies about animals that we watched when we were little ones, and hopefully if you've got any senses about you, still revisit as an adult. Well, most people have a few of those... I've got at least like twenty. One couple of movies that are very dear to me are Shiloh, and Shiloh 2: Shiloh Season, two indisputable classics that I was pretty much raised on, and have a burning nostalgia for. Shiloh boils down to one simple, loving archetype: a boy and his dog. Or, rather, a boy who desperately wishes to save a dog from going down the same road of violence and abuse that it's currant owner has. Marty Preston (Blake Heron, and Zachary Browne in the sequel because they just can't stick with one actor) is a young rural lad with a wholesome life and family, wishing for a dog of his own. Local roughneck and hunter Judd Travers (Scott Wilson) owns a whole pack of mutts that he mistreats when drunk, and aims to turn them all into vicious hunting dogs. When one small beagle escapes, it makes its way onto Preston land and suddenly Marty finds he has a new best friend. His stern father Ray (inimitable Michael Moriarty) warns him that the dog is probably Judd's, while his mother (excellent character actress Ann Dowd) urges compassion from her husband. Soon enough Judd comes looking, and conflict arises between the boy and the bitter old hunter. It's a children's story so nothing too messed up ever happens, but there's some touching lessons and surprising gravitas from both Moriarty and Wilson that is nice to see from such a seemingly innocuous, kid oriented franchise. Judd shows beautiful complexity in the sequel, the writing allowing Wilson to illustrate that not all mean people started out that way, and that with a little kindness and a lot of patience, old wounds can be burrowed into and treated. I first became a fan of Scott through the Shiloh films and he will always be Judd Travers to me. Marty finds a friend in Shiloh, getting right to the point of what these movies are about: friendship. New friends, old friends, and letting people in who need someone and don't even know it. It's great stuff, timeless to be sure, and always guaranteed to draw forth a smile. Rod Steiger lends his famous kind streak to the role of Doc Wallace, a convenience store owner with sagely wisdom for Marty and his fellow friends, as well as compassion for Judd. Now, there's a third film, also with Wilson but yet another different actor for Marty, and Moriarty sitting it out as well, which is why I haven't checked it out so far. Maybe it's time."
Con Air (1997),"Con Air is what I've come to expect of a standard Hollywood action flick, nothing more, nothing less. It's got plenty of action, big explosions, one-liners and pure entertainment value. The plot is pretty good, somewhat original, and fairly fast-paced. The acting is good, and the film has a surprisingly large amount of well-known good actors; Nicolas Cage, John Cusack, Danny Trejo, Steve Buscemi, Ving Rhames and John Malkovich. They all give good performances, as do most of the supporting actors. The characters are well-written and credible. I found it interesting how most of the characters aren't all black or white in their actions and personalities; many of them have a shade of gray or two. The action is well-done, exciting and intense. The special effects(the few there are) are good enough. The ending may be a little extreme, but it's a good climax, and the good things in the film make up for the bad; granted, there are a few downright lame parts, but there are far more good parts than bad. All in all, everything you'd expect from a Jerry Bruckheimer action film, and nothing else. I recommend it to fans of standard action films. 7/10"
Trees Lounge (1996),"Just happened upon this channel hopping In the early hours saw Steve Buscemi and wondered what's going on here? Not a lot as It seemed but that's not the point. Just sit back - preferably with a lager and allow Tree's Lounge to charm your trousers off.

Wonderfully subdued comedy showing that Buscemi Is not only a cult anti hero on screen but that he has much promise as a director. The characters stand out as they can be related to - everyone will recognise the Bill type regular permanently attached to the counter. Mark Boone's wife also as a seriously difficult woman who hasn't a clue what she really wants, stereotypically so. Tommy yes, Is a manchild aimlessly squandering his life away, for sure It Isn't a good role model to aspire to approaching middle age but hey that's his perogative.

This Is Steve's film and he's got charisma by the barrow full to make Tree's Lounge a real treat. That trick with the glasses will work once - provided your not too hammered practising. But It's Uncle Al who gets the best lines - ""he loves your mothers"", his excuse for his lecherous behaviour on the couch will bail a lot of people out of a lot of trouble.

This film Is very hard to track down, 90% of video shops I went to hadn't even heard of It and It's been on terrestrial Tele twice - once a week late- the reward Is well worth the effort."
Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! (1990),"Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! , deals with a deranged former mental patient , Ricky (Antonio Banderas) takes a soft-porn star prisoner , Marina (Victoria Abril , Almodovar's regular) , in the hopes of convincing her to marry him. But Marina , addictive in all things , soon becomes willing accomplice in Ricky's fantasies . A love story...with strings attached!

Pedro Almodóvar brings us a very mixed bag of outlandish characters , rapid dialogs , and absurd situations on a luxury flat and at a shooting , including R-rated sex scenes . Almodovar goes back to the darkest terrain of ¨Law of Desire¨ , concentrating on the relationship between soft-porn actress Marina and two men who attempt to control her . The more benign is her director -nicely played by veteran Francisco Rabal- in the movie-within-the movie , a genial , wheelchair-bound obsessive who leaves romantic messages on her answering machine and beguiles his lonely hours watching her masturbate on video . Austerily enjoyable and brightly colored film that contains wisted comedy , drama , thrills , chills , and haunting resultings . It can be very funny and very dramatic at the same time , so it was the perfect combination for me . In this peculiar flick Almodóvar established again his uniquely poetic and visually striking style . Almodovar turns a standard hostage thriller into a grim examination of the power games implicit in a couple , including Stockholm Syndrome . The story is not massively strong , but it is not bad either , as Almodóvar strings a few o different threads together and that , along with tension and skin going on throughout tends to ensure the movie is always interesting and thrilling . There are several naughty sex scenes and others really masochist as sadistic , as he kidnaps her in her apartment , beats her up while he goes out to score drugs for her . Resulting to a very black comedy in the vein of Buñuel's ¨Belle de Jour¨ or subsequent ¨The Skin I Live In¨ (2011) by Almodovar himself and worthy the comparison. Almodovar withholds all comment , and many will hate his refusal to moralise , others will relish to opportunity to think for themselves . The performance is also standout element of the film . As main cast is pretty good , excels a young Antonio Banderas as the unbalanced but alluring ex-patient who has spent the better part of his life in a psychiatric facility , and Victoria Abril as the tarnished actress who's pursued with pathological obsession . Along with customary actors from Almodovar factory's : Loles León , María Barranco , Rossy de Palma , Julieta Serrano and various familiar Spanish faces , such as : Lola Cardona , Emiliano Redondo , Jose Maria Tasso , Manuel Bandera , among others.

Luxurious and colorful cinematography by the prestigious cameraman José Luis Alcaine . The music by Oscar winner Ennio Morricone , is very good in which it fits the style and feeling of the film . The motion picture was realized in his peculiar style by Pedro Almodovar ; he often uses symbolism and metaphorical techniques to portray circular story lines , though here he directs a special dramedy , including his ordinary touches . Oscar-winning Spanish auteur Pedro Almodovar has made a name for himself with a series of unabashedly melodramatic titles , mixing comedy, drama, sex and violence , getting great successes . The openly homosexual director has shown an affinity for oddballs and outsiders, populating his films with transvestites and all of whom had previously been relegated to the closet. Almodovar directs throughout with splendid zip and he usually portrays strong female characters , gays and transexuals along his life , winning some important international prizes . He also showed a talent for working with women, and throughout his 40 year career has placed notorious actresses such as Penelope Cruz , Marisa Paredes or Victoria Abril . His first feature film, Pepi, Luci, Bom (1980), was made in 16 mm and blown-up to 35 mm for public release . In 1987, he and his brother Agustín Almodóvar established their own production company : El Deseo, S. A. Almodovar subsequently made other hits , such as : Labyrinth of passions , Law of desire , Women on the verge of a nervous breakdown , Bad education , All about my mother , Talk to her , Broken embraces , The Skin I Live In and many others . The ""Almodóvar phenomenon"" has reached all over the world , making his films very popular in many countries ."
Die xue shuang xiong  1989),"There is no doubt in mind that ""The Killer"" is easily the MOST ARTISTIC ACTION FLICK in the world. Not only that, it's also the BEST ACTION-DRAMA film around!

Directed by John Woo (now at his popular peak with ""M:I-2"" as his vehicle), ""The Killer"" tells the story of a professional killer (Chow Yun-Fat), a cop and a lady caught in crossfire. Chow Yun-Fat's act for his character is very solid, and at the same time he perfectly fits the action sequences.

Also written by John Woo, you can clearly see many of The Master's trademarks like slow-motion action, stunts, deep characterization, drama, doves, two-fisted gunplay, and missing from his Hollywood flick...gore! This movie is full of blood and gore, and from my point of view it does not make the film dirty but rather more realistic and expressive.

About the action, the level of violence is very high like that of the gore. Since this is a Hong Kong-made movie, Woo had all the freedom he wants and it clearly shows why this is considered by his millions of fans as their favorite Woo flick.

Two-fisted gunplay is very well presented here. Seen Tom Cruise (M:I-2), Nicolas Cage (Face/Off), Christian Slater (Broken Arrow), Dolph Lundgren (Blackjack) and John Travolta (Face/Off) all fire with 2 guns each? Well, for newcomers here, two-fisted gunplay has gotten of to a great start even before Woo directed the above-mentioned Hollywood stars. Chow Yun-Fat's 2-gun firing is simply perfect and it shows! Chow is NO MARTIAL ARTIST or STUNTMAN like Jackie Chan, but his use of guns and acting makes him exceed with quality.

Chow Yun-Fat was not even a popular action star before teaming with Woo. But Woo made the difference for him and Chow's image has gotten better since.

John Woo's directing is really perfect. As mentioned above, he had all the creative freedom he wanted with this movie...something missing from his Hollywood films. ""The Killer"" is considered to be his biggest teamup with Chow.

Woo is known to make non-action stars look great in action...Tom Cruise is a perfect example of this when he made ""M:I-2"".

Contrary to popular belief among newcomers, ""The Killer"" is an ART FILM. Those newcomers who've seen ""M:I-2"" might think that this classic is another ""blockbuster"" or brainless-action film. Anyone who understands the link between action and art will easily recognize the greatness Woo made here. Eventually, YOU'LL CARE ABOUT THE CHARACTERS AS THE STORY MOVES ON.

That said, the story is not about violence and money. The story presents CHARACTER, EMOTION, SORRY and HONOR. As a viewer, you should not just look at the action scenes, but you should concentrate on the story and characters within.

My conclusion: ""The Killer"" is a PURE QUALITY MOVIE THAT NEEDS TO BE SEEN BY EVERYONE. Whether you're a casual movie fan, quality viewer, blockbuster lover or whatever type of viewer you are, ""The Killer"" is film excellence as long as the viewer understands it.

Want the most artistic of action? REMEMBER THE KILLER!"
Gaslight (1944),"Ingrid Bergman experiences the murder of the aunt who has raised her. Ten years later, she returns to the house in which it happened with her new husband (Charles Boyer). Something is wrong, though, as her husband, once so kind to her, grows cold and cruel. Furthermore, Bergman begins to lose things, misplace things, and develop a case of kleptomania, or at least that's her husband's explanation. Boyer convinces his wife that she is going insane, that she is sick, and she becomes little more than a shut-in. She becomes paranoid, especially at her maids (the younger of which is played by Angela Lansbury in her first film role). Meanwhile, Joseph Cotten, a detective, gets an inkling that something is up in that household, and that it might be related to the aunt's murder. Gaslight is a very atmospheric film. The black and white cinematography is full of shadows, and there are interesting things going on in the focus. The music is also quite excellent, and very original. Classical music is also used to great effect. The plot is great, although maybe a tiny bit predictable (it didn't harm my enjoyment of the film whatsoever). The performances are top-notch, although Cotten doesn't add much to the picture. I mean, he's good, but his role perhaps isn't the one the original playwright or the screenwriters were most interested in. Anyone probably could have done just as well. Bergman's performances is to be counted amongst her best. Charles Boyer, an actor with whom I am unfamiliar, is so wicked in the film. You hate him, but you've got to admit it's an effective performance! And I can't finish without praising Angela Lansbury. Dame May Whitty also has a nice supporting role, although the role - the comic relief - is sometimes used at a bad time. I don't think, for instance, she should have come back in during the final sequence. Anyway, little flaws don't detract much from this masterpiece. Bravo, Mr. Cukor! 10/10."
8 1/2 (1963),"I feel much the same about Fellini's ""8 1/2"" as I do about his ""La Dolce Vita."" It's a film that people tell you you should like, and it seems impressive and profound when you're a young lad studying film and don't yet have the courage to go against critical and popular opinion. But once you've gained some cinematic sophistication of your own, you realize what an empty-headed exercise it is.

Federico Fellini is one of the most self-indulgent filmmakers who ever got behind a movie camera, and I simply don't have the interest or patience for the films of his later career. ""8 1/2"", again like ""La Dolce Vita,"" is dazzling to sit through once, because it looks gorgeous and there's the promise that on a second viewing, once you're no longer distracted by the flamboyant and beautiful visuals, you'll be able to sink your teeth into the rich substance of the film. But then you realize that there isn't any substance, and the film's beauty is only, and sadly, skin deep. And then you're just cheesed that you wasted so much time on it in the first place....

Grade: C+"
"Fast, Cheap & Out of Control (1997)","The four men profiled in this picture - topiary gardener George Mendonca, hairless mole rat enthusiast Ray Mendez, big animal trainer Dave Hoover, and robot scientist Ronald Brooks are all committed to their work. They work diligently, unconcerned with how the rest of the world might view their work. The quality of their work is job one and non-negotiable. Underlying that commitment is a view toward the future and what it might look like. They believe that if their work is well-thought out and well-done that they can shape the future. Conversely, they recognize that if their work isn't well-done or executed that it will be forgotten in due time. Mendonca frets about his sculptures existence after he passes on, Brooks sees a future in which robots will exist on the same plane as humans, and Hoover's work with big animals colors his views about man's supremacy. Mendez has learned the importance of co-operation from hairless rats.

All four recognize the tenuousness of life and the importance of always changing. They all see that the unpleasant alternative to evolving is extinction. That is clear from their respect for other forms of consciousness. They are open to other ways of learning and being. The unique social system of hairless mole rats is lauded as a more co-operative way of living. Robots' consciousness also is seen as something which is rapidly developing. The big animals that Hoover trains have their own systems for dealing with their world too. Mendonca's commitment to his job for over 30 years gives him the knowledge that change happens slowly.

The subjects' views on different ways of life are really brought to life against the backdrop of a score by Caleb Sampson. His use of a frequently repeating motif score bought to mind Philip Glass and gave the film a melancholy twinge. Also helpful in creating the mood are schlocky films, many science fiction and adventurous which often play while the four subjects tell their stories about what inspires and has guided them.

Morris is a filmmaker always worth watching. His choice of music, subject, and how he puts everything together makes him one of the most unique filmmakers working. These portraits of men in somewhat unusual jobs doesn't seem like it would recommend as a guide to the future, but through their dedication and engagement, we can see a viable world."
